To do so, you must  create a shared folder to store roaming user profiles, and then configure the user account to use a roaming user profile. After you complete this procedure, the user&#39;s profile, including the user&#39;s unique desktop settings, is stored on a server, and the profile is available to the user when the user logs on to any  Windows NT 4.0-based computer in the domain.<br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='2'></a>Requirements</h3><ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>A Windows NT Server 4.0-based computer (that meets the requirements listed on the Hardware Compatibility List [HCL]) that is  a primary domain controller must be available on the network when you configure the user account.</li><li>If you decide not to store roaming user profiles on the primary domain controller, an additional Windows NT Server 4.0-based computer must be available on the network.</li></ul><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='3'></a>How to Create a Shared Folder to Store Roaming User Profiles</h3>Before you configure a user account to use a roaming user profile, you must create a shared folder on a Windows NT Server 4.0-based computer in the domain to store the roaming user profiles.

In addition, you must be  logged on    as either an administrator or as a user that is a member of the Administrators local group or the Account Operators local group  in the domain. <br><br>To configure a user account to use a roaming user profile:<br><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Programs</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Administrative Tools (Common)</span>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>User Manager for Domains</strong> or <strong class='uiterm'>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong> for Windows Server 2000 or for Windows Server 2003.</li><li>Double-click the user account to which you want to assign a roaming profile, and then click <span class='text-base'>Profile</span>.</li><li> Type the complete path to the shared folder that contains the user&#39;s profile in the <span class='text-base'>User Profile Path</span> box, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>. <br><br>Use  the following format for the user profile path:<br><div class='indent'>\\<strong class='sbody-strong'>server_name</strong>\<strong class='sbody-strong'>shared_folder_name</strong>\<strong class='sbody-strong'>user_profile_folder_name</strong></div> <br>For example, if you want to store the user&#39;s roaming profile in a folder that has the same name as the user account in a shared folder that is named &quot;Profiles&quot; on a server that is named &quot;Server1,&quot; type the following path: <div class='indent'><span class='sbody-userinput'>\\Server1\Profiles\%username%</span></div><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: Windows NT automatically replaces the %username% variable with the user account name when it creates and accesses the user profile.
