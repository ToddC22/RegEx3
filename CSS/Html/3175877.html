<h3><span><span><span><span>What is this article about?</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>This article details how to pay for Microsoft Advertisings including accepted payment methods, payment types (prepay and postpay), and how to set up a payment method on an account.<br>
<br>
Payment methods are entered at the advertiser level, and then individually associated with each account. The number of accounts that can be entered at the advertiser level depends on the shell type, but typically, one&nbsp;payment instrument can be associated to up to five&nbsp;active accounts at a time. To add and associate more cards to accounts, qualify the customer for a </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3170511" managed-link="" target="_blank">Service level/Shell Type</a><span><span><span> upgrade as needed.<br>
<br>
Accounts are only eligible to go live once a valid payment instrument is associated with the account.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a><span><span><span><span>1.1 Direct debit payment options</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>SEPA</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>SEPA is a payment integration initiative of the European Union for the simplification of bank transfers denominated in Euro. SEPA enables customers to make cashless Euro payments using a single bank account and a single set of payment instruments. SEPA is available as a payment instrument (PI) for advertisers in Microsoft Advertising with a German billing address. Customers can reference directions on how to add SEPA as a payment instrument in the help content: <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/60017/3" managed-link="" target="_blank">Paying with SEPA Direct Debit</a>.<br>
<br>
To add SEPA as a payment instrument:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>From the Payment Methods tab, select <strong>ADD SEPA Direct Debit.&nbsp;</strong></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Enter the SEPA direct debit account name.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Enter the bank account details (advertisers will be informed on this page that they are agreeing to Microsoft to debiting the account).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>With the migration from ELV direct debit to SEPA, the <strong>Account Number</strong> is replaced by <strong>IMicrosoft AdvertisingN</strong> and the <strong>Sort Code</strong> is replaced by <strong>BIC</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Complete the <strong>Billing Address</strong> information.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Next</strong> to continue.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Review the bank account verification instructions.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>SEPA PI remains in <strong>Pending Validation</strong> status until the verification steps are complete.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Complete the bank account verification steps (confirm the deposit amount <strong>or&nbsp;</strong>three-digit code on the customer&rsquo;s bank statement and verify in the <strong>Microsoft Advertising Payment method</strong> tab). If the micro deposit does not appear in the customer&rsquo;s bank account within the specified timeframe*, the customer will be required to remove the SEPA PI and re-add it in order to initiate another PICV challenge. If an advertiser fails many times within a short period, their SEPA PI may be blocked from being added back. If this occurs, escalate to Ad Support.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>:&nbsp;SEPA will only be available for association to prepay EUR accounts; otherwise, SEPA will be greyed out. Confirm the payment option (prepay or postpay) in the <strong>Account List</strong> as needed.<br>
<br>
SEPA must have made at least one successful payment on the first associated account to be added to other accounts in the customer shell.<br>
<br>
*SEPA payments and refunds will be processed similar to credit card payments; however, the settlement period will be slightly longer (up to five&nbsp;business days for initial payments, up to two&nbsp;business days for subsequent payments). Payments submitted after 8 PM&nbsp;Central European Time (UTC+1) will be processed starting the following business day. Payments cannot be canceled once initiated.&nbsp;Payments cannot be canceled once initiated. For questions or problems related to SEPA direct debit transactions, the customer will need to contact their banking institution.<br>
<br>
The prepaid balance on the account will not increase until after the payment has settled. Advertisers using the prepay billing option with credit cards or direct debit (SEPA) have the option of automatically recharging their payment instrument when it&#39;s used 80 percent of its budget. The auto-recharge feature helps protect advertisers&#39; campaigns from unplanned pauses due to depleted budget. To set up this functionality, advertisers can select the <strong>Accounts &amp; Billing</strong> page and then the <strong>Details</strong> tab. Select the link to set up Auto-Recharge and select the recharge amount.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: There is one automated re-try for failed SEPA payment attempts.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Agency-managed advertisers are unable to add a payment method to new accounts if they are set up as Sold-To only. The following error message is displayed when the advertiser attempts to create a new account.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><em><span><span><span>&quot;Microsoft Advertising has encountered an error and is unable to continue with your selected action. Select Support at the bottom of any Microsoft Advertising page and provide the Microsoft Advertising Support Team with the details of the problem.&quot;</span></span></span></em></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>For a Sold-To advertiser to add a payment method to their account, a request to change their SAP from Sold-To to No-Hold should be submitted to <strong>WW Online Credit Services&gt;WOCS Credit Services (UCMT).

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Each Boleto Banc&aacute;rio payment slip can only be used to make a single payment to your Microsoft Advertising account. Every time you want to fund your account with a Boleto, you&#39;ll need to create a new one.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Boleto Banc&aacute;rio payments can be made at a bank, post office, lottery agent, and some supermarkets.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Payments can take up to three&nbsp;banking days to reach Microsoft Advertising. If the payment is entered over the weekend, it will take longer than three&nbsp;days.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>When the customer selects <strong>make a payment</strong>, they will be prompted to <strong>confirm payment information</strong>. In <strong>Payment and Estimated Taxes</strong>, enter the desired amount, then select the &lsquo;<strong>Pay Now</strong> button to finish the transaction. Note that the <strong>Estimate Taxes</strong> can be disregarded.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Funding the account begins by returning to the <strong>Available Payment Methods</strong> screen and selecting the option to <strong>add funds</strong> associated with this payment instrument. Note that the same <strong>add funds</strong> link will be available for all other payment methods within the <strong>Available Payment Methods</strong> section.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><span><strong><span><span><span><a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>1.3 Conversion fees and authorization charges</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Conversion fees: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>The currency in which the customer is billed is the currency in which Microsoft will send the request for payment to the advertiser&#39;s bank. Advertisers should ensure that their financial institutions accept international currency transactions; most banks in the US&nbsp;will charge anywhere from 1-5% of the transaction amount in conversion fees. Advertisers should always confer with their banks to confirm acceptance of charges in foreign currencies, and to assess if they will be charged any conversion fees. Conversion fees are assessed by the advertiser&rsquo;s bank, and Microsoft does not have insight into these charges. We can refund these charges if the advertiser contacts us with this request.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>For a quick reference on currency conversions, search Bing for <strong>currency converter&nbsp;</strong>and the calculation tool is built right into the search engine results page.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Important: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>You cannot change the currency settings of an account after you set it up; however, you can create a new account that uses a different currency setting. Microsoft Advertising cannot bill in a different currency than the currency that was selected for the account.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<span><span>For an external list of accepted currencies see</span></span> <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51064/3" managed-link="" target="_blank">Choosing your account currency</a><span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span><span><br>
<br>
<strong>Authorization charges:</strong> If the advertiser selects their language as English-United States (EN-US) during signup and inputs a payment method associated with an Indian billing address, there will be an authorization swipe of $1 (about 45 rupees, based on the current exchange rate), followed by a credit for that same amount. This is a known issue and a fix is expected to be deployed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the advertiser selects their language as English-India (EN-IN) during signup and inputs a payment method associated with an Indian billing address, there will be a 2 rupee charge that is reversed quickly (usually within a matter of hours but could take a few days, depending on the financial institution). The authorization charge is used only to confirm the payment method is active.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Before escalating to Global Support to confirm whether an authorization transaction was either released or settled by Microsoft, first have the customer speak to their financial institution about the time to remove the hold. If the standard lead time for hold removal on the bank&#39;s side has passed, escalate the transaction ID (from the statement), date, time, and amount of the hold to Global Support.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Messaging for authorization charges (aka&nbsp;Authorization holds)</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><em><span><span><span>&quot;Non-PIN based credit and debit transactions are a two-step process, consisting of an authorization and settlement. Authorization charges are holds on funds and are standard practice in banking industries. The purpose is to verify the account is valid and that sufficient funds are available. Hold durations depend on the type of card used and are subject to the policies of the card issuer.&quot;</span></span></span></em></span></p>

<p><span><em><span><span><span>&quot;I can get this to a specialist to ensure the authorization did not settle on our side. Once we get confirmation, you may need to follow up with your financial institution to understand their policy for releasing authorization holds on unsettled charges.&quot;</span></span></span></em></span></p>

<p><span><em><span><span><span>&quot;The time to release authorization holds varies by financial institution. We unfortunately cannot speak to the internal processes of each institution with which we conduct business; however, we typically see funds held for authorization released within a few hours&mdash;sometimes holds on credit cards take a few days to fall off and it&rsquo;s not unheard of for holds on credit cards to last as long as thirty days. I would recommend following up with your financial institution to understand what their policy is for releasing authorization holds.&quot;</span></span></span></em></span></p>

Threshold billing allows advertisers to set up a recurring payment to a debit or credit card. In India, there is a limitation on the merchant code offers by some banks, which blocks recurring charges. As a result, advertisers who signed up using debit cards would see a decline on the payment. Because the blocked payments caused a significant amount of customer dissatisfaction and calls to support, we decided to stop accepting debit cards for India advertisers at this time.

			<p><span><span><span><span>AMEX is currently supported for limited currencies, which may include: US Dollar (USD), Euro (EUR), British Sterling Pound (GBP), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), and Swiss Franc (CHF).

			<p><span><span><span><span>There are no restrictions on using a credit card with a billing address in a country other than the currency chosen for the Microsoft Advertising account, except for accounts billed in INR, BLR, and TWD. Accounts billed in each of these controlled currencies require a credit card with an in-market billing address. Customers who want to use a payment instrument with a billing address from a controlled currency market can only use the currency associated with that controlled currency market.</span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span>Certain cards issued from banks in India require a username and password to conduct online transactions and payments. The Microsoft Advertising user interface cannot support this functionality; therefore, the advertiser must use a different card.</span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising does not reject chip cards, but the system does not perform any PIN validation. Therefore, cards that require a manual input device or other PIN hardware cannot be used with Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span>The same credit card can only be associated with five&nbsp;accounts.</span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span>If a credit card is declined three times the account will go into credit hold.</span></span></span></span></p>

If the PayPal account is funded by a credit card, the advertiser&rsquo;s credit card statement will show charges from a generic Microsoft Online Services.&nbsp;The specific Billing Agreement ID that was charged will also be referenced. This enables the advertiser to reconcile between cash receipts on the Microsoft Advertising Billing tab and their credit card statement. PayPal will decline any credits for charges processed more than six months from the original transaction date. For compliance reasons, we should still attempt to reverse the charges, allow them to decline, then follow the declined credit memo process as needed. Visa and MasterCard credit cards sponsored by PayPal are accepted in foreign markets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><strong><span><span><span><a id="3" name="3"></a></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>3. Ways to pay </span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising offers advertisers three ways to pay, either before or after clicks are accrued. Prepay accounts allow advertisers to pay in advance for clicks while postpay accounts allow ads to deliver before the advertiser is charged.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Because postpay payment option allows advertisers to accrue clicks before they are charged, the term postpay can be used to refer to either threshold or monthly invoice.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The standard billing threshold starts at $50 and can then be raised to $100, $500, $1,000, and $2,000. (In Euros, the amounts are &euro;50, &euro;100, &euro;500, &euro;1,000, and &euro;2,000.)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

(If the account does not reach the billing threshold three times by the BCD, the count is reset to one at the start of the next billing month.)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If payment is declined three times in succession, the billing threshold is automatically reduced to the next lower level. For example, a billing threshold of $100 would be lowered to $50.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Four consecutive declines will result in the threshold being reset to the lowest limit.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The billing threshold is increased automatically; it cannot be increased manually.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The billing threshold is not automatically increased after a certain&nbsp;time has passed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>An advertiser is billed as soon as the billing threshold is reached, regardless of the BCD.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>It is possible to have multiple accounts that reach billing thresholds at the same time or intermittently throughout the month. An advertiser may also have differing billing thresholds for different accounts, depending on each account&#39;s history. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Advertisers are charged one time per month on their billing date, or when spend reaches their billing threshold, whichever comes first.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising has a minimum charge amount of $1 USD.

<p><span><span><span><span>When <strong>Bill Me Now</strong> is selected, there may be some clicks that have been received but aren&#39;t yet propagated into the billing system. On rare occasions, this may mean the advertiser receives a charge for slightly more than what was the outstanding balance at the time <strong>Bill Me Now</strong> was selected. Usually, this discrepancy is less than $5, depending on how well the account is delivering.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If funds have been transferred from the customer&#39;s bank to Microsoft&#39;s bank but not applied to the prepay account within 5 days, it is possible that payment was not received by the Cash Applications team (Cashapps), or there was a failure when adding the payment to the user interface (for example, the Microsoft Advertising account details were not specified in their payment or payment could not be located). In these cases, an offline payment status request (template below) should be submitted to CashApps.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Complete the ASD SR Template </span></span></span><span><span><span><strong>Worldwide Online Credit Services (WOCS)&gt;Offline Payment Inquiry - Payment Not Applied</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Escalate the ticket via transfer to <strong>WW Online Credit Services&gt;WOCS Accounts Receivable</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: With SEPA the initial payment settlement time is up to five&nbsp;business days and up to two&nbsp;business days for subsequent payments.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the advertiser would like to stop the payment from being applied to the account, you can inform CashApps. However, before any offline payment can be refunded, the payment must first be located and posted in the UI. If payment is not yet rendering, request an offline payment status from CashApps first. Assuming the payment is located, the payment should be reversed in the UI by CSS, before going to&nbsp;SANOPS (aka AdOps) &nbsp;for processing an offline refund to the customer. If payment cannot be posted in the UI by CashApps, but they confirm payment was received, CashApps may be able to directly initiate a refund to AP (sending a customer link to complete MPC details as part of the offline refund process). Alternatively, CashApps can also assist with &#39;reapplying&#39; the funds to another account if this is the preferred course of action (instead of a refund). </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Funds not found:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> There may be instances where CashApps cannot locate customer payments. Often this is the result of customers not supplying adequate proof of the original payment transaction from their bank. If the customer is unable or unwilling to provide sufficient documentation or proof to CashApps for payment investigation, the customer should be advised to resolve the payment dispute with their banking institution. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If an online payment processed by Boleto or SEPA has not been applied to a Microsoft Advertising account, Global Support should investigate the payment status. If Global Support confirms that the payment is traceable, and the account is not affected by a fraud closure, a request for offline payment application can then be submitted to the Cash Application team using the steps and template above. Be sure to include the confirmation from Global Support that the payment was received and must be applied.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Advertisers can associate a new payment method to active accounts, or delete payment methods not associated to active accounts, at any time.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If an advertiser currently uses invoice billing, they&nbsp;can use the Change Payment Instrument feature to choose to change to credit card billing in Microsoft Advertising. To change from credit card to invoice billing, Support must handle that change.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>As soon as the advertiser associates a new payment method with an account, all pending charges will be transferred to it. Microsoft Advertising authorizes the card each time we attempt to charge it, resulting in a $1 authorization fee appearing on the billing statement. We will not actually charge $1, as Microsoft Advertising does not ever settle the $1 charge. The authorization should drop off the account after a few days, depending on the issuing bank for that card.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Advertisers cannot change the currency settings for an account after it is set up. However, users can create a new account that has a different currency setting.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Charges cannot be transferred to a different payment method after a transaction is completed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If a card expires, the card issuer (bank or other financial institution) may decline payment for the account charges. If payment is declined, ads for the account may be paused.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The account may continue to accrue charges even though the card is expired. Advertisers can stop additional charges to their accounts by pausing campaigns on the <strong>Campaigns</strong> page. After the card is updated or the advertiser switches to a different payment method, they will need to resume the campaign to display ads again.

<h3><span><strong><span><span><span><a id="7" name="7"></a></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>7. Paperless billing</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>The option to enroll in delivery via email, also known as paperless invoicing, can be done only if the following scenarios apply:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The user is a super admin. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The customer is on invoice billing (not available for non-invoice customers currently).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span>Paperless invoicing may not be available in the following situations:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>- The <strong>Bill To</strong> address is in a country location that does not support our current paperless options. For example, only France invoice customers with a France <strong>Sold To</strong> location are eligible (due Microsoft Advertising system limitations <strong>Bill To</strong> France locations and non-invoice customers will always receive hard copy via postal mail).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>- Per local regulations, postal mail invoices are required for billing addresses. Currently, the following countries/region require hard copy invoices: China, Colombia, India, Korea, Panama, Peru, Russia, Taiwan, and Venezuela.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>See <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/paperless" managed-link="" target="_blank">Billing settings for monthly invoice accounts</a></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span><span> for additional information. </span></span></span></span></p>
