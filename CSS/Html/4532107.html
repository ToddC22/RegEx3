			<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em>Are you happy that this would do the job for you? Ideally when do you want to take delivery of this?&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><em><span><span>&ldquo;It seems like we&#39;ve giving you all you are looking for based on our earlier discussion. Can we start the order and wrap things up?&rdquo;</span></span></em></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>This technique works well when there is a good rapport with the customer.</span></span></span></p>

The logical reasons are that they haven&rsquo;t yet received a compelling enough reason to make the purchase (the customer isn&rsquo;t convinced), haven&rsquo;t had all their needs or concerns addressed, or the customer doesn&rsquo;t understand parts of the interaction.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Alternatively, an objection can also be a good sign. It could mean that the customer is engaged and actively considering the purchase. Sometimes the objection is a request for more information or for additional confirmation. The fact that customers are raising their concerns, gives you the opportunity to address it.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Keep the discussion simple, natural, and at point, while adapting to your customer&rsquo;s communication style.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Less rapport does not mean being robotic.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>To humanize chat conversations, you should look for cues and opportunities to inject something personal into the conversation. For example, if the customer asks for advice or recommendation, you can share your own experience and excitement about the product.</span></span></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Inject humor if and where appropriate, ensuring it is natural and follows the flow of the conversation, the customer&rsquo;s tone and mood.</span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><span><span><span>While you should display your human side in messaging, it is recommended to avoid using <em><span>fluffy</span></em> verbiage and being overly apologetic to customers.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span lang="DE"><span><span>Be authentic.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Rapport building starts with your welcoming phrase</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Mirror the customer&rsquo;s communication style</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Use words that the customer uses in their conversation, especially any adjectives. They have chosen to use these words, so they have a relevance to the content and an alternative word may not have the same meaning for them. Skilled advisors should also be able to match their customers pace and tone, demonstrating commonality and helping to build rapport.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Show empathy</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Showing empathy creates a sense of trust and mutual understanding. For example: Language such as <em><span>&ldquo;I understand what you mean&rdquo;</span></em>, &ldquo;<em><span>I can see where you are coming from&rdquo;, </span></em>&ldquo;<em><span>That must have made you feel really good</span></em>&rdquo;, <em><span>&ldquo;I understand why you would think that way</span></em>&rdquo;.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Change your perspective - Get out of your own head and into your customer&rsquo;s. Being able to say to them, <em><span>&ldquo;I understand the frustration you&rsquo;re feeling&rdquo;</span></em> means more than saying, <em><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re frustrated.&rdquo;</span></em></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>When using empathy statements, it is good to use personal pronouns, active verbs and show authenticity.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em><span>I can understand how frustrating it is when&hellip;&rdquo;</span></em></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em><span>How can I make this process easier for you?</span></em>&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em><span>I imagine how upsetting it is to&hellip;&rdquo;</span></em></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em><span>I can help with that.&rdquo;</span></em></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em><span>If I skip anything important, please stop me and let me know</span></em>.&rdquo;</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Pause before responding</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>If you find yourself in a situation where a lot is riding on your response, take a moment to pause. Change your perspective and see the situation from their point of view. Usually, this can diffuse your initial reaction and allow you to respond from a place of understanding.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Go off script</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Reading from a script can be a barrier to building rapport. Customers often disengage when they can tell the conversation is scripted. If it&rsquo;s necessary to read from a script, put your own personality into it. This will help sound like it&rsquo;s coming from you.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Calibrate the rapport</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>New sales advocates are often overly sensitive to the time of a potential buyer, so they dive right in without an ice breaker and it doesn&#39;t go well. Others can spend too much time chatting, while the customer may just want to get down to business. You should read the customer and find the right amount of rapport focused conversation.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Read the culture</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Adjust the approach depending on the customer. Be aware of cultural nuances and how best to respond.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Create trust and establish credibility</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Develop deep knowledge of the products and services and potentially the industry and be passionate about the subject. But also, be willing to say &ldquo;<em><span>I don&rsquo;t know</span></em>&rdquo; if this is the honest answer.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Boost reliability</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>State expectations upfront and report on them regularly. Follow through on promises and communicate if something goes wrong by taking responsibility.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Promote intimacy</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Use the customer&rsquo;s name, share something personal (makes you human and more interesting), tune into their tone, emotion, and mood.</span></span></span></p>
