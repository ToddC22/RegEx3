	<li>Verify the inbound tracking information from customer (Customer returned product sent to Service Center).
	<ul class="sbody-free_list">
		<li>
		<p>If the agent verifies that there is no charge for the AE in MST, If it is &lt;40 days (Step 4), advise the customer that their card has a hold for replacement amount but has not been charged.
