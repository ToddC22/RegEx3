<h4><a id="3"></a><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1 Decline schedule<a class="ms-asset-internalBookmark" id="DeclineSchedule" title="DeclineSchedule"></a></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As a risk-management measure, Microsoft Advertising follows a strict schedule when an account&#39;s credit card is declined that is sometimes referred to as the scope of darkness, since actions are taken on the account as the declines progress. In situations where our platform determines the debt as uncollectable based on the current card on file, a card may encounter fewer than 11 swipe attempts (and notification) before the account goes into write-off status. In all cases, customers are notified of the desire to collect funds and have options to recover their account before it goes into write-off status. </span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Only a failed swipe initiated by Microsoft Advertising will advance the account through the decline schedule. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>When a user selects the <strong>Bill Me Now</strong> option, it will not advance the account through the declined payments schedule, even if the swipe fails. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If a </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>declined payment occurs within 30 days of the account creation, the account is automatically put on credit hold status (even if the Bill Me Now option triggered it) this measure was put in place for security reasons.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Payment attempts made on the backup payment method do <strong>not</strong> count toward the decline schedule.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Any action initiated against the account or card does <strong>not</strong> impact the backup payment method.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>This decline schedule applies to&nbsp;system-initiated attempts to collect payment, including attempts because of a manually established threshold limit.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Not all failed attempts will result in a retry. Customers will see at least one failure and no more than 11 attempts, before a debt is considered uncollectable and written off. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Threshold invoices for declined swipe attempts will still show <strong>Amount paid by preauthorized debit</strong> at the bottom of the invoice PDF. This does not indicate whether the payment was successful but means that the advertiser&rsquo;s account type (Self-serve/Self-serve Plus) authorizes Microsoft to charge the payment method on file upon reaching the threshold or anniversary date.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Additional payment attempts will be made on the backup payment method do <strong>not</strong> count toward the decline schedule. Any action initiated against the account or card do <strong>not</strong> impact the backup payment method.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This decline schedule applies to system-initiated attempts to collect payment from the primary payment method, including attempts because of a manually established threshold limit. At any point throughout this schedule, Microsoft may determine the debt (or card) has an &ldquo;unretryable&rdquo; error and decide <strong>not</strong> to proceed through this schedule. Regardless of the number of attempts made to a card, following six months of uncollectable debt, the account will be written off for bad debt and show with a write-off status.</span></span> <span><span><span>At which point the account is not recoverable (see more information about this detailed under </span></span></span><strong><span><span>Attempt 11</span></span></strong><span><span> in the table below</span></span><span><span><span>). </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="7"></a><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 Assist the customer using the credit hold dashboard <a class="ms-asset-internalBookmark" id="AssistCustomer" title="AssistCustomer"></a></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>This functionality is available in all markets except India as of June 23th, 2016. Deployments in India will be coming soon, and this article will be updated with the timeline and confirmed deployment as it is available.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customers on Credit Hold will receive a UI notification stating, <em>&quot;This account is on hold or credit hold because there was a problem with your payment.&quot; </em>Selecting the link within this notification will direct the customer through the Credit Hold Dashboard to resolve the issue per account or payment method. Except for payment failures with Monthly Invoice accounts or scenarios where the user is not the Bill-To Customer, the customer can self-resolve their credit hold issues. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For payment failures, the customer will be presented with the following resolution options: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Update this payment method. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Choose one of your existing payment methods to replace this.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span> Add a new payment method to replace the current one.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Any of these options will send the customer through the appropriate workflow and will alert the customer of errors throughout the process, will show success of the changes or additions made, will summarize the total balance across all of the accounts that are impacted by the PI issues with the balance due and allow the customer to pay the due balance. If the payment changes are successful and the payment has been submitted, there is a 20-minute SLA for the changes to take effect and the credit hold status to be updated.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Internal note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If customer is showing a status of <strong>Payments not received</strong> but a balance due of zero, this indicates this account was put on hold by partner (Yahoo) or the customer&#39;s account has been written off. In both cases, the account cannot be rehabilitated. To confirm whether a monthly invoice account is current or delinquent, email the customer service alias on the customer-facing PDF invoices (this alias directs to a market-specific accounts receivable team) to determine how much, if any, balance is outstanding (the customer does not need to be included in this communication). If an outstanding balance is causing the credit hold, inform the advertiser of how much is due and guide them to submit payment using the instructions available on their PDF invoices in the Microsoft Advertising UI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If the advertiser requires a payment plan, direct the advertiser to contact the alias on their invoice for further assistance. Depending on the length and severity of the delinquency, a payment plan may not be possible and the credit hold may be permanent.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>When accounts are behind in the payment of their invoices, Microsoft&rsquo;s billing department notifies the advertisers associated to these accounts. The following account, account number or name, is past due. You can send in the past due amount now. Let me know once you have sent the check or when you plan to send the check, and I can relay this information to our billing department. If you have a copy of the check, send it to me. I will forward this to the billing department, and they may expedite removal of the hold.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
