<p><span><span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer has a preferred email that is different than the primary email associated with the account, enter this in ASD under the &lsquo;preferred email&rsquo; field. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a>1.3&nbsp;<span><span>Coding&nbsp;for insufficient information vs dropped contact</span></span></h4>

<p><span><span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Insufficient information and dropped contact are both used when you have customer contact information to create a ticket, but the customer becomes non-responsive.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Dropped contact</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> should only be used when the customer becomes non-responsive before you can identify the L1 Customer Issue.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Insufficient information</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> should be used when you have a general problem statement from the customer (you can code for L1 Customer Issue) but you do not have enough information to code beyond L2 topic.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Code for the most appropriate solution delivered if you can code through Issue Code 4 (Problem) before the customer becomes non-responsive, do not code the ticket for insufficient information if you at least have a root cause or problem. Instead code for the most likely Solution Delivered and set the ticket to Closed-Unresolved. For example: If a client is unable to add a Credit Card and you provide all the troubleshooting but before escalating customer becomes unresponsive, you should not close the ticket as insufficient because you can code through L4. Code for the closest solution to &lsquo;educated&rsquo;.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong>For all new inbound support issues that have a different&nbsp;level 1 (customer issue) in ASD.</strong></p>

			<p><strong>Example:</strong> The advertiser wants to add a payment method which is coded under Billing and Payments. At the same time, the advertiser asks for information on reports, which would be coded under Reports and Data.</p>

			<p><strong>Always&nbsp;</strong>check the customer history in ASD to ensure that there isn&rsquo;t a ticket already open for the same issue for the customer.</p>

			<p><strong>If there is an existing ticket</strong>, follow guidance in&nbsp;<a bookmark-id="6" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3171493#6" managed-link="" target="">section 6</a>.&nbsp;<strong>If there is a closed ticket</strong>&nbsp;for the same query, make sure the reopen policy is followed.</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Do not</strong>&nbsp;create a new parent ticket if the advertiser has multiple, brief questions related to the same issue or root cause.</p>

			<p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;An advertiser wants to add a payment method which is coded under Billing and Payments. At the same time, the advertiser requests information about the difference between prepay and postpay. In this scenario, since all recommendations are covered by Billing and Payments, it is not required to create separate parent tickets.</p>

			<p><strong>Example:</strong> An advertiser has general questions about&nbsp;auto-tagging, then the conversation evolves to discuss Editor in detail. A single ticket for Editor is sufficient&nbsp;unless&nbsp;an escalation or follow up is required for the auto-tagging query. &nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Example:</strong> An advertiser has a set of editorial appeals, which require multiple communications with NQS to fully resolve.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>If a follow-up or escalation is required for a secondary question or concern (even for the same L1 customer issue).</strong></p>

			<p><strong>For example:</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li>If the advertiser indicates they didn&rsquo;t receive an expected coupon code in addition to their payment method inquiry, both issues would be coded under Billing and Payments, but a follow-up is required to deliver the code.</li>
				<li>For bad match investigations, if additional terms are provided that require a new investigation (the scope of the investigation is different from the original request).</li>
			</ul>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Do not</strong>&nbsp;create a new ticket if there is an existing SR and the advertiser wants to wait for the current ticket owner to resolve the issue.</p>

			<p>Simply make a note in the existing ticket outlining the call and any expectations that were set.</p>

			<p><strong>Example:</strong>&nbsp;Issue has been escalated to L2 or customer called in just asking for an update and wishes to continue communicating with the previous advocate.</p>

			<p>Select <strong>Edit Comments</strong>&nbsp;in the ticket to notify the ticket owner that the customer contacted us again for an update.</p>

<p><span><span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Child </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>tickets may be created from an existing parent ticket if dictated by a specific workflow (editorial or fraud appeals, PMA expedites, and secondary escalation is required).

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Do</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> create a child ticket if the issue requires action from a different team (BOS or Tier 2 partners such as Editorial) and you need to maintain contact with the advertiser.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Do</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> create a child ticket to request SME review (for credits above role limits or coupons).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Do</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> <strong>Not</strong> create a new child ticket if you can reopen the original escalation within the partner&rsquo;s specified reopen period.

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Subject:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Specify the account number, Microsoft Advertising account name and issue type in the subject of the ticket. The subject should be customer-facing, so be sure to avoid using terms that are disallowed in conversation with advertisers. Always double-check the subject of outgoing mails. The ticket subject will prepopulate into the subject of any outbound mail and must <strong>not</strong> contain any personal data or sensitive information (including the username).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Queue: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>When a new ticket is created, the ticket will be generated in the default queue assigned to the ASD user. Always ensure the ticket is created in the queue that best aligns with the intake language and region. <strong>Note</strong>: If the user&#39;s default queue needs to be updated, a manager will need to be notified to update the user template. The queue may be changed at any time before the SR ID is generated. Once the SR ID is generated, the ticket will need to be transferred between queues, as necessary.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>SR email templates: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Follow-up, Lost Contact Closure, and Closure templates are available to populate outbound emails. These should be modified accordingly. Issue-specific templates are also available but the content in the body should not be edited unless directed to do so in the corresponding SIR (for example, fraud response templates should not be modified).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Save</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> and <strong>Complete</strong> buttons: Use <strong>Save</strong> to save any changes while retaining access to view the ticket. Use <strong>Complete</strong> to save and exit viewing the ticket.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Issue Status: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Issue Status determines the state of the ticket and should be selected as <strong>Open</strong>, <strong>Closed &ndash; Resolved</strong>, or <strong>Closed &ndash; Unresolved</strong> as appropriate. This field determines whether the ticket is recognized in the system as opened or closed.

<p><span>To help protect your customer accounts from fraud, follow these best practices:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Be on the alert for phishing and social engineering. Phishing for account information leads to fraud and compromise of customer information.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Always validate you are talking to the actual account owner and authenticate or verify the user.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;ts:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Don&#39;t proactively provide information that is considered personal data to a customer (for example, first name, last name, address, telephone number, or last four digits of a credit card).</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Don&#39;t proactively provide Microsoft Advertising account, billing, or campaign information that could be used as proofs, even after the caller is verified. Account or campaign information include all personal data as well as any account-specific information (for example, customer/account name, campaign names, settings, and web addresses).</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;t give hints </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>or any verbal cues</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;t tell them if their guesses are close.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;t give initial letters to words they are asking for.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;t tell them the type of credit card they have on file.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;t tell them if an account is active.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;t request personal data via email. Instead use DTM.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;t divulge information about the support tools you are using. For example, names of tools, what you can use for search criteria, what you can/can&rsquo;t do or can/can&rsquo;t see on the tool screens.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;t fortify or manually verify users that have been suspended. Users are only suspended when there is confirmed fraudulent activity on the account. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&#39;t lead a customer or provide hints that enable the customer to pass fortification or manual verification.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Don&#39;t divulge user information or manual authentication proofs (for example, their username, card type, or last four digits of their card) even if the caller completes strong (manual) authentication. This information is considered high business impact (HBI) because it is used for authentication purposes.<br>
	<br>
	Once the customer is fortified, you may ask the customer if <em>pieces</em> of the information in their account are correct. Do not disclose the entire HBI information. For example, you may say, <em>&ldquo;In case follow-up is needed, is it okay if we reach out to the Outlook address you have on file, or the phone number ending in ####?&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Messaging: Why do we need to authenticate?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><em><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;In order to keep our customers&rsquo; account information safe, we need to authenticate users who contact us to ensure they have permission to access and act on behalf of the account.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></em></li>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>When a customer is logged into Microsoft Advertising</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>, they can chat or request a callback. In both cases, the customer is considered automatically authenticated because we know definitively that they have access to the account. While in request a callback, connecting to the user&rsquo;s phone number is sufficient proof of access to the account. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For chat, you can see if the customer is logged in, you will see their advertising account number, user email, username and more.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you see their account details, they are logged into Microsoft Advertising and are automatically authenticated.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If a customer is not logged in or requests a chat from the Contact Us webpage, the account details will not be available, and you will need to verify the customer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<em>&ldquo;To help with your request, I need to send you a code to validate your access to the account. May I first have an email address associated to your Microsoft Advertising account?&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Since it is the Microsoft account user that is authenticated, agency emails used to access multiple accounts need only be authenticated once.</span></span></span><span><span><span><span> However, not all users have access to all accounts, and you should always check whether the user that was authenticated actually has access to <strong>all</strong> accounts in question.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Initial Response Time (IRT) SLAs</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Inbound phone contacts should be greeted within 60 seconds.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>All chats should land with an advocate within 60 seconds of requesting the chat. Inbound chats should be greeted within 20 seconds of connecting to an advocate. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Inbound email should be answered within one&nbsp;business day.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Phone</span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><br>
Before&nbsp;disconnecting a phone conversation, use the standard opening 3 times at 10 second intervals. On the final attempt, append the opening with the following messaging before disconnecting the call. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><em>&quot;I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m unable to hear you. If you can hear me, please call us back at [insert support number]. Thank you for calling Microsoft Advertising. Have a good day.&quot;</em></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Chat</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
Before disconnecting an ongoing chat conversation (where the issue has been specified), advertisers should be given three opportunities within a six-minute window to respond.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Phone recording:</span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><span><br>
A call recording over phone is not customer-facing and should never be shared with customers. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span>US customers are recorded by default, but advocates may suspend recording if requested by the caller. In rest of world, recording is off by default and advocates may turn on recording if advertisers don&rsquo;t object. Advertisers should be informed the call may be recorded for quality and training<span><span>.</span></span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Chat transcript:</span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><br>
A customer may directly copy chat transcripts from the chat window before ending the chat session with the advocate. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For all Microsoft lines of business, when a customer requests a chat transcript, advocates must first authenticate the customer before providing the transcript via email. </span></span></span></p>

If the advertiser insists on being assisted by the original ticket owner, inform the advertiser that you can either help with the issue now or you can leave a note for the current ticket owner that immediate assistance is required. If the advertiser is willing to wait for the original ticket owner to get back to them, set expectations with the advertiser that you&#39;ve left a note in the existing ticket and the ticket owner will get back to them as soon as possible.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><br>

In some cases, a warm transfer to a different program or team is necessary because the issue is out of scope for inbound support. Adult and Services are the only programs that currently accept warm phone transfers. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Transfer a ticket</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASD push transfers can be used when the ticket must be manually relocated from one queue to another for the purpose of overcoming language barriers and time zone restrictions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>All L2 queues are enabled for global push transfers. If you must move an L1 ticket to a different site&rsquo;s queues, you may need to coordinate with an L2/SME to first put the ticket into an L2 queue.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Transferring the ticket may cause ticket ownership to be removed. Document the SR number before transferring the ticket to a different queue to easily re-assume ownership of the ticket.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. Taking ownership of existing tickets</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If there is an existing ticket for the advertiser&rsquo;s current issue and none of the exception scenarios listed below apply, you should take ownership of the ticket <strong>immediately.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Some advocates may not have the permissions necessary to pull parent and child tickets. If you are encountering this issue, contact your local senior advocate (for example, L2/SME/Escalation POC) to pull the respective tickets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The goal of this process is to ensure that customer issues are resolved as quickly and efficiently as possible by the advocate who is in the best position to move the investigation forward, regardless of site.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Exceptions -- <span>Do not take ownership in the following scenarios</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span>:</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Tickets that have Escalations</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> - <strong>Do not take ownership </strong></span></span></span><span><span><span>This applies to open escalations via email or UCMT (the intent is to <strong>not&nbsp;</strong>interfere with existing escalation conversations though you can provide coaching/clarification to the ticket owner, if needed). If a child ticket is not created per process (for example,&nbsp;Help Needed requests or refund approval requests), the escalation details must be clearly documented in the ticket notes. </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Supervisor tickets</span></strong><span> - <strong>Do not take ownership</strong> if supervisors/managers at the original ticket owner&#39;s location have ownership of the ticket and are intervening in the customer engagement for recovery. Original ticket owners must be sure to clearly document the supervisor engagement in the ticket notes.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Note:</strong> For the first two scenarios listed above, it may still be appropriate to take ownership of existing ticket if the advertiser is adamant on being helped immediately by a new advocate.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Advertiser&rsquo;s request</span></strong></span><span> - <strong>Do not take ownership </strong>if the advertiser has explicitly requested to continue to work with existing ticket owner and the previous ticket is still open or has been closed for less than seven&nbsp;days.</span><span> </span><span> </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>DSAT recovery</span></strong><span> - <strong>Do not take ownership</strong>&nbsp;if the same issue is already being handled by another advocate via an open DSAT recovery ticket for the customer. &#8203;&#8203;</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>If you do not take ownership, updates and documentation requirements:</span></span></strong><span><span><br>
<br>
If any of the above scenarios are met and you determine that you should <strong>not</strong> take ownership of the ticket, it is critical that the following steps be taken <strong>immediately</strong> to ensure that the existing ticket owner is successful in helping the advertiser: </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong>Update advertiser&nbsp;</strong>- Inform the advertiser about the status of the ticket (for example, SLAs for Traffic Quality investigations).</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Set expectations with advertiser </span></strong><span>- When informing the advertiser about the next steps that will be taken by the existing ticket owner, do not make commitments that they might not be able to fulfil.</span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do not promise that certain actions will be taken (for example, a refund will be issued) when you don&#39;t know the outcome of the investigation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do not tell the customer that they&#39;ll receive a response within a specific timeframe (for example, within the same day) as the existing ticket owner might be off work.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Example messaging</strong>:&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><em>&quot;I&#39;ll document our conversation and (Insert Existing Ticket Owner Name) will reach out as soon as they have an update.&quot;</em></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Document interaction </span></strong><span>- Document within the ticket notes: </span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span>Update provided - The update you provided to the advertiser. </span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Expectations - The expectations you set with the advertiser.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Miscellaneous - Any miscellaneous information that may be of benefit to the advocate who owns the ticket. If the customer provides new information which was not originally shared with the existing ticket owner, make sure to document it in the ticket notes so the existing ticket owner is aware.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Cross-site communication for ticket ownership requests</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong></strong></span></span><span><span><span>When an advocate has identified a ticket that requires reassignment based on the ticket ownership process (defined above), inform your team lead/manager/SME who is responsible for sending a communication to the respective site which should take ticket ownership. To ensure accountability, each site should designate one primary point of contact and a backup per shift who are responsible for submitting and managing ticket ownership requests. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The <span>Ticket Ownership SharePoint </span></span></span><span> </span><span> </span><span><span>located </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://sharepoint.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/sites/StandardSupport/l1resources/Agent%20Resources/TCO%20Request.xlsx" managed-link="" target="_blank">here</a><span><span> should be used to communicate and document all ticket ownership requests. To maintain quality and avoid confusion, make sure to follow the usage guidelines:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Check the SP regularly to ensure all requests are handled within SLA.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Do not create multiple copies of the SP doc. We should only have one original file to avoid confusion. Make sure to save your changes to the original file.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>After saving your changes, exit the SP file right away. Do not keep the file open when not in use to ensure other users can access it and make changes.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Indicate your site&nbsp;name before each new update to a case so we can easily tell which comments belong to which site (for example: <em>&quot;Alorica: We have taken ownership of this ticket and will work with the customer.&quot;</em>).</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Do not delete any previous requests, updates, or information. The SP should serve as a central location for historical ticket ownership requests so all content should be maintained. The status of resolved ticket ownership requests should be changed to <strong>Closed&nbsp;</strong>by the requester once ticket ownership is taken correctly and no further actions are needed.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>The ticket ownership request must be submitted to the other site within <strong>24 hours </strong>(excluding weekends) of interacting with the customer to ensure the ticket does not sit idle and there are no delays in handling the customer&#39;s issue.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For <strong>urgent communications or emergency situations</strong>, the following distribution lists can be used to communicate with each respective site. However, they should only be used as a last resort as the SharePoint is the primary submission method for ticket ownership requests.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="7" name="7"></a>7. First call resolution</h3>

<p><span><span><span>First call resolution (FCR) means that the advertiser&#39;s inquiry was fully addressed and resolved during the first interaction. It is preferred to extend the duration of the first call as necessary to resolve the issue without additional follow-ups.<br>
<br>
If you can obtain confirmation of issue resolution during the first contact, there is no need for additional follow-ups.<br>
<br>
If first call resolution is achieved, before ending the call, offer to provide the advertiser the SR ID for this issue in case the advertiser determines the concern was not actually resolved and needs to reopen the ticket.<br>
<br>
<span>Give the advertiser the option of a final email summarizing resolution. A follow-up email is not always required. </span></span></span><span> </span><span> </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>If it is ever necessary to proactively reference contact information in the account (either for confirming contact preferences or referring a customer to another user on the account), always mask/redact the information and provide just enough to enable the customer. See <a bookmark-id="1.1" href="#1.1" managed-link="">section </a><span><a bookmark-id="1.1" href="#1.1" managed-link="">1.1</a> for examples.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Font size and color</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Use Segoe UI font as a first choice. If it is unavailable, use Tahoma or Calibri.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Use the same font style and size throughout the entire email.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do not type communications in font lower than size 10 or above font size 14.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do not use any font colors.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do not use bold, italics all CAPS or underline text when communicating to customers except to highlight important information such as XID, SR number.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Templates</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>There are customizable templates available in ASD that you can use to help craft your communications. These templates offer a good framework for Microsoft Writing Style communication but are optional.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>When using templates:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Remember to change any information highlighted in blue, and then change the font color to all black before sending the message to the customer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><a id="10" name="10"></a>10. Follow-up procedure</h3>

<p>A follow-up with an advertiser is only necessary if the issue requires further action that cannot be completed during the initial interaction or if additional information is required from the customer before the investigation can proceed (for example, there is no need to schedule a follow-up with the advertiser if the issue was resolved or a solution was provided on the first contact).<br>
<br>
<span>Follow-ups should be scheduled to occur within 48 hours unless otherwise requested by the advertiser. Any exceptions must be documented in the ticket as being requested by the advertiser. </span><br>
<br>
<span>If an advertiser requests a follow up more than seven&nbsp;days in the future, advise the advertiser to call back when time permits to address the issue and a new ticket will be created at that time. </span><br>
<br>
<span>Call-backs should always be logged in the SR for any scheduled follow-ups. </span><br>
<br>
Performance tickets may be left open as needed for up to three days to monitor performance improvement as the result of changes.<br>
<br>
Be deliberate about scheduling follow-ups at a specific time rather than leaving it open (for example&nbsp;say &quot;<em>Is there a particular date and time I can call you back to discuss the progress of your case</em>&quot; rather than &quot;<em>I&#39;ll follow-up with you in a couple days to let you know how things are going&quot;). </em></p>

<p>When conducting a call-back, advocates must first identify themselves and where they&#39;re calling from before requesting to speak with the advertiser. Once the advertiser is on the phone, the advertiser must be informed that the call may be monitored or recorded for training purposes.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>First phone follow-up failed:</strong></p>

</ol>

<p><strong>Second phone follow-up failed. </strong><span>Should occur 24 hours after first follow-up if there is no response from the advertiser:</span></p>

<p>For new chat contacts that are dropped but contact information is known, a single email follow-up should be conducted before the ticket is closed.</p>

<p>For ongoing chat contacts (for which the issue has already been communicated by the advertiser), advertisers should be given three opportunities to respond being two minutes each. (Total time given to respond being six minutes.) After this the advocate should provide the re-join link in Comms Console and advise the customer to come back to us if needed.</p>

<h4><span><span><a id="10.4" name="10.4"></a>10.4 Follow-up email </span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span>The follow-up email should be tailored for each interaction. Use the follow-up email template and insert additional guidance and content as necessary to resolve the issue or acquire additional details to proceed with the investigation. The follow-up email template is accessible within ASD and may be inserted directly into an outbound email.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Always check the recipient and subject and proofread and spell check any outbound emails before sending.</span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><a id="10.5" name="10.5"></a>10.5 Sending emails from ASD </span></span></h4>

<p>Whenever an email is sent from ASD, the customer is the default recipient in the <strong>To</strong> line and the default subject of the ticket will be the SRX ID appended by the current subject line of the ticket. It is not possible to remove the SRX from the subject of outbound emails from ASD. Because the ASD ticketing system will automatically route all inbound emails to the appropriate ticket based on the SRX ID within the subject regardless of the destination queue email, emails cannot be sent from one ASD ticket to another.</p>

<p>Email templates exist for follow-up, closure, and issue-specific notifications (for example, fraud permanent closure). Insert and modify templates as needed to optimize your time spent writing emails. <strong>Note:</strong> Fraud-specific templates have been approved by legal and the body of the message should <strong>not&nbsp;</strong>be altered.</p>

<h3><a id="11" name="11"></a>11. Non-responsive advertisers</h3>

<p><span><span><span>An advertiser should not be considered non-responsive until 24 hours after a scheduled follow-up passes without response from the advertiser (either by phone or email) and there is no documentation within the ticket indicating the advertiser prefers a different follow-up cadence. </span></span></span></p>

<p>Advertisers should be given 24 hours to respond to a missed contact attempt before they are considered non-responsive.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If an advertiser missed a scheduled phone follow-up and does not respond to the follow-up email within 24 hours, a second follow-up by phone should be attempted prior to closure. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If an advertiser does not respond to the follow-up email within 24 hours and is not available for the second phone attempt, the closing email should be sent, and the ticket closed. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB">A first chat contact may be considered non-responsive once the advertiser fails to respond to three follow-up attempts in a six minute&nbsp;period. The chat window may be closed after the final follow-up attempt.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span>To close a ticket change, the Issue Status from <strong>Open</strong> to either <strong>Closed &ndash; Resolved</strong> or <strong>Closed &ndash; Unresolved</strong> as appropriate. Whoever delivers resolution to the advertiser should own the closure of the ticket.<br>
<br>
Tickets should be closed if an advertiser is non-responsive, regardless of issue resolution state. An issue may be considered resolved if there is no further action that can be taken to alter the outcome, even if the outcome is perceived as unacceptable by the advertiser.<br>
<br>
All call-backs must be cleared and child tickets closed before a parent ticket can be closed. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Child tickets should be closed in the queue most appropriate for the language, channel, and ticket owner (for example close it in an L2 queue if the L2 provided resolution for a child).<br>

Close the ticket immediately after the closing email is sent (IF a closing email is sent). <strong>Note</strong>: Closure mails are not required for tickets but are helpful if additional value can be added to improve the campaigns or the customer&#39;s experience with Microsoft Advertising. Advertisers may refuse a closure/summary email, but you should specify in the ticket why a closure/summary mail was not sent. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Escalated tickets</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Tier 2 Escalation teams may have customer satisfaction surveys where Tier 1 advocates are the &lsquo;customer&rsquo; and can provide feedback on how well your escalation was handled. These survey links are presented in UCMT closing mails that may reopen the Tier 1 ticket unless Tier 2 is properly informed of ASD closure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you want to close an ASD ticket with an unresolved/active Tier 2 escalation, you <strong>must</strong> inform the escalation partner of your ticket closure with the messaging &ldquo;<em>The Tier 1 ticket is ready for closure due to &lt;reason&gt;.

<h3><span><span><span><a id="17" name="17"></a>17. Ticket management expectations</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><strong><span>Idle policy</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>ASD SRs should not idle for more than two&nbsp;workdays. Therefore, updates should be provided to the advertiser consistently. Any exception to this cadence should be documented within the ASD ticket.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Aging case policy</span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Tickets over 20 days are considered aging. Tickets should not age beyond 20 days unless there is valid cause (issue is under higher-level review within Microsoft for bug resolution or customer is engaged but communications are ill-timed for completion). </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>On average, tickets should be closed in four&nbsp;days or less.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Cases should not age due to non-responsive advertisers.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span>Reopen policy </span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>You can re-open an existing ASD SR if a customer is calling about the exact same issue within seven&nbsp;days of the ticket closure. Otherwise, a new parent SR should be created.</span></span></span><span> </span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Roles and accountabilities </span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The following metrics are goals and should be actively managed by all ticket owners and managers.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Idle: Maximum two&nbsp;days</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Aging: &lt;20 days</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>MTTC: four days is the goal; under six&nbsp;days is considered healthy.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>All advocates (typically L2s/SMEs) are accountable for engaging Microsoft escalation points as needed and managing communications to ensure thorough and accurate resolution for Microsoft Advertising customers. This includes:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Ensuring partners are properly informed of relevant case information to appropriately resolve the issue in a timely manner.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Ensuring partners are informed if the ASD Support ticket is resolved/closed prior to partner ticket resolution/closure.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ensuring escalations to partners are progressing appropriately and that any stalled cases are raised in the Tier 1/CSS Sync call</span></span></span></span>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Ensuring process, content and large billing dispute concerns are appropriately raised to the TAs for issues related to specific tickets or to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/speakup" managed-link="" target="_blank">Speak Up!</a> for any issues process concerns/issue not related to specific tickets.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Any responses from Microsoft escalation points are scrubbed for confidential/internal information before providing responses back to customers.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Any trending process/knowledge issues and gaps are raised to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/speakup" managed-link="" target="_blank">Speak Up!</a> to be addressed by Microsoft.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Coaching and feedback on L1 performance is provided to managers for delivery.</span></span></span></span></li>
