<p><strong>II Verify if customer is from the same domain or not</strong></p>

<p><strong>Caller is not from the same domain</strong> &ndash; either when the customer already provided a different domain which is listed in VLSC or <span>customer reports not receiving the email which support sent to the customers provided email address or does not respond, the customer is unverified. </span><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li><span>Provide the unverified message and don&rsquo;t give any admin data to the customer</span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></li>
	<li>Close the case as &ldquo;<span>Un-resolved&rdquo; with AIRC: Root Cause - Volume Licensing\Misroute/Redirect\External\Administrator </span></li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Customer is from the same domain: </strong></p>

<p><span>To verify if the customer is from the same domain&nbsp; <strong>and that email is not a consumer domain</strong> s<span><span lang="EN-GB">end an email with the case number to the email address the customer provided and ask the customer to reply from that email so that we can verify access to the email account.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>

<p>If the domain match there are different scenarios to consider:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><a name="_Hlk32322671"> Email address provided by the customer has the same email domain as the email address listed in VLSC &ndash; <strong>and that email is not a consumer domain.</strong> </a></span>

	<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha">
		<li><span><span> Email address provided by the customer matches the email address listed in VLSC, but customer doesn&rsquo;t recall which specific email was used. (User may have multiple email accounts linked to different license IDs). </span></span></li>
		<li><span>Email address provided by the customer does NOT match the email address listed in VLSC, but that VLSC email looks like a shared mailbox in the same domain.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>

<p><strong>Guidance how to support Reseller:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Authenticating Resellers who don&rsquo;t know their licensing ID (Agreement Numbers or Open License Numbers)</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Unless the reseller is named on the license and Admin in VLSC or they are the Partner of Record (POR) in Explore.ms, NO information should be provided.</li>
	<li>Direct Resellers to request the customer VLSC Admin add them as an Admin to any licenses as needed in the VLSC Portal.</li>
</ol>

<p>Direct Reseller calls in for assistance on multiple customers and has the credentials for the customers&rsquo; accounts requesting agreement information.</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Reseller is an Admin in VLSC or Point of Record (PORPOR) in Explore.ms and can be verified on an agreement = Proceed on agreements ONLY that the Reseller is an Admin or PORPOR on.</li>
	<li>Reseller is not an Admin on the agreement(s) in VLSC or a POR in Explore.ms = No information can be provided. Only general assistance</li>
</ol>

<p>Reseller indicates they have the customers credentials, but are not an Admin on the agreement(s) in VLSC nor a POR in Explore.ms</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>No information can be provided. Only general assistance</li>
	<li>Microsoft does not support the sharing of credentials. It is against MS policy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Reseller requests to open a ticket on behalf of a customer.</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Reseller is an Admin in VLSC or POR in Explore.ms and can be verified = Proceed to open ticket as an Admin</li>
	<li>Reseller is not an Admin in VLSC or a POR in Explore.ms = As long as the RSC is not exposing / communicating any customer information back to the Reseller and all communication goes directly back to customer, the Reseller can open up a ticket.</li>
</ol>

<p>Reseller calls in for information on a customer agreement</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>Reseller is an Admin in VLSC or POR in Explore.ms and can be verified = Proceed</li>
	<li>Reseller is not an Admin in VLSC or a POR in Explore.ms = General information on VL can be answered, but no customer agreement information can be provided.</li>
</ol>

<p>For a Reseller to work on behalf of the customer and for any PII information to be exposed to them, they must be named as an Admin on the customers agreement in VLSC or a Partner or Record in Explore.ms and able to pass the verification process. No Exceptions.</p>
