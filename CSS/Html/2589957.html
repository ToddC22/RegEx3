<header><h1>ASMS – Case Closure Handling (Unresponsive Customer, Confirmed Close)</h1></header><p>Submit a <a href="http://sharepoint/sites/fastrack/Lists/ModTrack/NewForm.aspx?RootFolder=" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ModTrack</a> request to update this TSG.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</strong></h3>

<p><span>This TSG provides guidance on how to close a case once a customer has either confirmed closure or has become unresponsive.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Customers may become unresponsive in the normal workflow of a case. In these instances, you should follow the guidance below to ensure that the customer has a good experience and an adequate chance to respond before you close their case.</span></p>

<h3><strong><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><strong><span><span>Drive the conversation with customers. If you&rsquo;ve sent a solution or requested information and the customer goes unresponsive, follow up through other channels (such as email or phone) to complete the communication thread. </span></span></strong></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span>After sending a solution, check in with the customer to ensure your solution worked. Only close the case after the solution has been confirmed. If the customer is not responsive, follow the Strike process that best fits your case.</span></span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Do not suggest temporary case closure to the customer.</strong> You may receive cases where the request is not able to be fulfilled or resolved within a reasonable timeframe. The resolution may not be available until weeks or months later (ex: quota increase backlog, credit request). In these situations, you should keep the case open until the case is resolved.</p>

	<p><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: Closing a case temporarily or prematurely can result in a survey being sent to the customer despite the issue being unresolved. It can also </span></span><span><span><span><span>skew&nbsp;the data used to track&nbsp;case&nbsp;volume.</span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><strong><span><span>Do not send strike emails on weekends or holidays. </span></span></strong></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span>Emails that are sent on the eve of a holiday or a weekend will likely go unnoticed until the holiday or weekend is over. For example, emails that are sent Friday afternoon will likely only be responded to on Monday or Tuesday.</span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span>If you are aware of your customer&rsquo;s location, it is a good idea to check a local holiday calendar before sending any strike emails. This is to ensure that you don&rsquo;t accidentally send a strike email to them during a holiday. </span></span></span></li>
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span>See the </span></span><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-holidays-to-your-calendar-in-outlook-for-windows-f16d872f-8dad-4750-bb7c-166e72c26977" target="_self"><em><span><span>Add Holidays to Your Calendar in Outlook for Windows</span></span></em></a><span><span> article for directions on adding regional holidays to your Outlook calendar.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><strong><span><span><span>If no solution has been delivered and the customer becomes unresponsive: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Attempt to call your customer at least once using the number listed in the case, and document the result of the attempt in <span>Service Desk</span></span></span></span><span> </span><span><span><span>&ndash; even if the customer&rsquo;s preferred method of contact is email. </span></span></span></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span>If you call your customer and reach a voicemail box, leave a message explaining the nature of your call.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Enunciate your message clearly.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li>Be&nbsp;<span>sure to follow up any voicemail messages with an email to the customer.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>If a phone number is not given as part of the case, you should not call the number they have listed in CMAT.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>When contacting a customer and the email bounces back as &quot;<em>undeliverable</em>&quot; you should follow the <a bookmark-id="The Three-Strike Process" href="#The Three-Strike Process" managed-link="">Three-Strike Process</a>. </strong>This is to ensure that we have properly attempted to contact the customer, in the event there was an unintended system error on either our side or their side.</li>
	<li><span><strong>If you are striking a Premier customer, ensure the Enhanced Incident Manager (IM+) is included on all strike emails.</strong>&nbsp;</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>If the IM+ is not listed on your case, include the Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM); formally the Technical Account Manager (TAM).</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>CSAMs or IM+ may request&nbsp;that support close a case&nbsp;due to contract expiry, even though the case&nbsp;is unresolved. </strong>Since ASMS support is free, we should continue to offer assistance to the Partner regardless of their contract status. If a CSAM or IM+&nbsp;reaches out to you with such a request, engage&nbsp;your manager, who will&nbsp;work with them to decide on the best course of action.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Be sure to follow the CSS Case Closure&nbsp;<span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4538668#5.%20Templates" managed-link="" target="_blank">Templates</a> outlined in the&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4538668" managed-link="" target="_blank">Last Quality Response (LQR) Procedure TSG</a>.&nbsp;</span></span></strong>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Last Quality Response (LQR) is a critical element of Case Closure that delivers a meaningful and consistent case closure experience with customers. It ensures all the necessary elements needed to conclude interaction with the customer is holistic and leaves the customer with a feeling of resolution.&nbsp;</li>

<ul>
	<li><span>If a customer has become unresponsive at any time during life of the case, apply the following process to give the customer a chance to respond, before you close their case due to inactivity.</span></li>
	<li><span>Be sure to carefully review the <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finternal.support.services.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhelp%2F2589957%23Policy&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cmievan%40microsoft.com%7C4ca35236364a4f20d31b08d859b06cc1%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637357961559466272&amp;sdata=TCZti%2FNUkuB9YRwyiJx0aAJSYa%2BOrkWTxuQylt3yseM%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_self"><em><span>Policy</span></em></a> section, especially the part about weekends and holidays before you start applying strikes.</span></li>
	<li><span>If you are striking a Premier customer, ensure the Enhanced Incident Manager<strong> </strong>(IM+) is included on all strike emails. You can find the IM+ details listed in the <em>Contact </em>section of the case or in Azure Support Center (ASC). <strong>Note:</strong> You will need to manually add this contact to your customer communications. </span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>If the IM+ is not listed on your case, include the Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM); formally the TAM.</span></li>
		<li>If the IM+ or CSAM are OOF, reach out to their respective back-ups.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>If your customer responds during the three-strike process, discontinue the three-strike process and continue to work with the customer. If they become unresponsive again, re-start the three-strike process.</span></li>
	<li><span>If the customer does not respond by Strike 3, the IM+ can also give approval to close the case.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Process"></a><strong><span><span>Process</span></span></strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><strong>First Strike: </strong>Send the first strike at least 24 hours after the customer has become unresponsive.</span>
