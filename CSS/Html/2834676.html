<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the service you are looking at is not handled by Capacity Management, refer to <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4086154" target="_self">TSG 4086154</a> for all other quota service offerings.</p>

<h3><a name="Policy"></a><strong>Policy</strong></h3>

<p>Keep the following guidelines in mind when providing support to your customers:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Cases come from both the quota blade and from the technical blade that is administering the service.</li>
	<li><strong>For all subscription types and compute requests </strong>&ndash; When your customer requests that you increase their compute quota, send a DevOps ticket to the <strong>Quota Automation Service (QMS)</strong>.<br>
	All tickets must be created separately, you can&#39;t use the Multiple option any longer.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong>Note:</strong> If you need to create more than 1 ticket that will get assigned to QMS, make sure the first ticket you create is <strong>not</strong> assigned to QMS until you are done with all other tickets, otherwise QMS will see only one ticket, fulfil the request and close your support request (SR). If you have other actions in the case that would be affected by QMS closing your case when all quota is completed, create a placeholder ticket and add the term <em>placeholder</em> to the title. Then, assign the placeholder ticket to yourself. That will block QMS from closing the case. When you have completed all actions on the case, you can go close your placeholder ticket and close your case.</li>
		<li><strong>Exceptions:</strong>
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li>If the ticket has already been through QMS, assign it to <strong>CM24x7</strong>.</li>
			<li>If the ticket requires a credit check (as seen in step 3), assign it to <strong>CM24x7</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>&#8203;&#8203;<span>When&nbsp;ASMS receives a&nbsp;collaboration task&nbsp;from another team&nbsp;(for example, the Technical team) that requires us to engage CM 24x7&nbsp;via an RDQuota request, remember to always add a suffix next to the case number in the RDQuota request field </span><em>MSSolve ID </em>to mark the case as a placeholder<span>. This will prevent QMS from automatically closing the case.</span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li><span><strong>&#8203;Example:&nbsp;</strong><span>A placeholder suffix can simply be a number, such as &quot;120040321001431-1.&quot;</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Communications with the customer:</strong>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>The communications around how each request is handled lies solely with the Capacity Management team.&nbsp;<span>If CM 24*7 does not provide you with customer messaging, ask them to provide it.</span></li>
		<li>For all quota cases, look at the verbatim, communications, and task logs to see if the quota request details have already been provided by the customer or from the automated system. Be sensitive to your customer&rsquo;s efforts in providing you with information and double check that the information that you are asking for hasn&rsquo;t already been provided.</li>
		<li>When responding to your customer, use Capacity Management&rsquo;s message in its entirety. ASMS only helps with providing Capacity Management&rsquo;s predefined messaging (included in the ticket when they respond to you) to the customer.</li>
		<li>ASMS SEs should never interpret or create messaging, but only copy and paste what is being provided by the Capacity Management team within the ticket. Only approved messaging may be communicated to the customer.</li>
		<li>All messaging that Capacity Management provides to ASMS has been approved by Engineering and Marketing.</li>
		<li>If you feel the need to paraphrase the message (Example:&nbsp;You have not recieved a update from CM 24*7 but the customer is engaging you for an update), you can leverage this <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/Paraphrasing%20Guide%20for%20Quota.docx?d=w02764889f12a4b49a07407bb6e64b2fe&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=x8fqdb" managed-link="" target="_blank">paraphrasing guide</a>.Refrain from providing sensitive information such as Azure max quota limits or specific criteria for credit checks. Providing such information increases vulnerability.</li>
		<li>
		<p>After the quota has been increased by the Capacity team, ask the customer to click the <strong>Refresh</strong><strong> </strong>button on the<em> Usage+quota</em> page in the Ibiza Portal, to see the updated quota. Note, this page must be manually refreshed, in order to see the updated quota. </p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Internal Customers</strong> &ndash; If an internal customer is already in direct contact with Capacity Management for a quota increase, check with the internal customer if they need your help. If not, they can work with Capacity Management directly, and you can close your case as resolved.</li>
	<li><strong>Free Accounts </strong>&ndash; Free Accounts cannot have their quotas increased. (Once your customer has removed their monetary cap, it is no longer a Free Account, and their quotas can be increased through the normal process).</li>
	<li><strong>Customer Feedback </strong>&ndash; If your customer wants to submit feedback about capacity related issues, direct them to the <a href="https://feedback.azure.com/forums/34192--general-feedback">Azure Feedback site</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Additional Resources (for Internal Microsoft (MSFT) Representatives)</strong>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FRESH/Azure/Pages/Azure%20Support%20Escalation.aspx">GetHelp</a> &ndash; Customers who experience difficulty getting the proper attention on their case, may escalate to <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/FRESH/Azure/Pages/Azure%20Support%20Escalation.aspx">GetHelp</a> instead of coming directly to ASMS. In some instances, MSFT Representatives (i.e. TAMs) may also leverage this support path on behalf of their customer.<br>
		<strong>Note:</strong> ASMS should not re-direct a customer to open a GetHelp ticket, as the ticket will only be re-directed back to ASMS.</li>
		<li><a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AzureServiceExperience/Pages/Capacity.aspx">Azure Reliability Portal</a> &ndash; Internal MSFT Representatives can leverage this link if they want to check on the capacity status of Azure regions.</li>
		<li>MCIO Capacity Update Meetings &ndash; If an Internal MSFT Representative would like to attend the weekly call with MCIO team about current constraints, they can email <a href="mailto:ASMSCM@microsoft.com?Subject=Please%20send%20me%20an%20invite%20to%20the%20MCIO%20Capacity%20Update%20Meetings%21">ASMS Change Management</a> to have the meeting invite forwarded.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Keep cases with backlogged quota tickets open.</strong>&nbsp;Whenever a quota request ticket is in a backlogged state, the case needs to remain open.<br>
	<br>
	Tickets in a backlogged state feed into Microsoft&#39;s capacity planning efforts and are needed to understand the actual demand. Closing a backlogged ticket leads to a low forecast.<br>
	<br>
	Please always leave the case open when the associated quota ticket is backlogged&nbsp;and refrain from suggesting the customer to close the case before resolution. From the customers&#39; perspective a backlogged quota ticket&nbsp;means the case is not resolved &ndash; and that is why the case needs to stay open until the quota request is completed.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="How_to_Check_Quota_in_ASC"></a><strong>How to Check Quota in Azure Support Center (ASC)</strong></p>

<p>The following quota details can be checked in Azure Support Center (ASC):</p>

<ul>
	<li>CRP Quota Usage</li>
	<li>SKU Restrictions</li>
	<li>VM Family Usage</li>
	<li>NRP Quota Usage</li>
	<li>SRP Quota Usage</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How to check quota details in ASC:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>In ASC, click <strong>Resource Explorer</strong> in the top menu.</li>
	<li>Select the <strong>Subscription ID</strong> you want to check.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>RP Details</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Scroll down to see <strong>SKU Restrictions</strong> and other details.</li>
</ol>

<p>ASC SKU Restrictions:</p>

<h3><a name="Support_Scenarios"></a><strong>Support Scenarios</strong></h3>

<p>Capacity Management handles the following scenarios:</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Allocation Errors for VMs</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>In this circumstance, check to see if your customer has sufficient quota to allocate the VM for the specific VM SKU in ASC or Jarvis. </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span><span>If the customer has insufficient quota,</span></span></strong><span><span> they will have error messages that specifically call out <em>quota</em>, in addition to mentioning how many cores are available and how many are needed for the customer&rsquo;s desired allocation. </span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span>Guide these customers through expanding their quota limits.</span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong><span><span>If the customer has sufficient quota, </span></span></strong><span><span>they may get errors due to the cluster they are on being full, despite the customer themselves having sufficient quota. Error messages calling out this scenario will specifically call out <em>allocation failure errors.</em> </span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span>These customers will need to be helped by the technical team (IAAS). Transfer the case over to them as a misroute by doing the following:</span></span>
		<ol>
			<li><span><span>Update the case&rsquo;s <em>Support Topic</em> of the case to <strong>Received an Allocation Failure</strong>.</span></span></li>
			<li><span><span>Update the <em>Support Subtopic</em> to <strong>Unable to deploy or start my VM</strong>.</span></span></li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="CannotResizePre-ExistingVMsAfterQuotaInc"></a><strong>Cannot Resize Pre-Existing VMs After Quota Increase</strong></p>

<p>There are multiple reasons that may prevent customers from resizing pre-existing VMs after their quota has been increased, though they can deploy new VMs without trouble.</p>

<p>For these cases, create a collaboration task for the VM team.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Do not advise customers to directly contact technical teams if you encounter technical issues after the main issue (<strong>Capacity issue</strong>) has been resolved.</p>

<p><strong>Classic VMs</strong></p>

<p>Only customers presently using classic VMs will be allowed to continue using them or requesting more classic VMs.&nbsp; Other users will be blocked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you get a request from a user that wants access to classic VMs, you can send an IcM to&nbsp;<a href="https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/create?tmpl=I112k1">https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/create?tmpl=I112k1</a>&nbsp;and that team can whitelist the user to use classic VMs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Compute Cores</strong></p>

<p><strong>SKU Enablement and Quota Increase Requests for D15i_v2/DS15i_v2 VM Series</strong></p>

<p>If a customer requests to enable the SKU or increase the quota of a&nbsp;D15i_v2/DS15i_v2 VM,&nbsp;direct them to fill out and submit the relevant form below:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR0FTPNXHdWpJlO27GE-bHitUMkZUWEFPNjFPNVgyMkhZS05FSzlPTzRIOS4u" managed-link="">Access to D/DS15i_v2 sizes</a></li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;RD Quota tickets should not be submitted for these SKUs.</p>

<p><strong>Cosmos DB</strong></p>

<p>If a customer requests to increase the quota of a Cosmos DB, use the templates for Cosmos DB ticket creation found in the <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/STCM/Compute/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc={8f7ff874-7352-4079-b033-cf1d4a09f1f9}&amp;action=view&amp;wd=target%28RDQuota%20Management.one%7C4235ce54-1a14-4f18-adaf-eb256d9b2ddf%2FQuota%20Ticket%20Templates%7Cde669606-8d84-4b11-bdb2-e844dea7bdb7%2F%29" managed-link="">Quota Template Tickets</a> section of the OneNote.</p>

<p><strong>Managed Disks (ARM only)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Region Enablement</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Region enablement is completed by the Capacity Management team and is often worked in parallel to a quota request. See the <a href="https://aka.ms/quotatickettemplates" target="_self"><strong>RDQuota Ticket Templates</strong></a> section for region enablement forms.</li>
	<li>Customers requesting for Region Enablement/Whitelisting and Quota increase for <strong>US East 2 EUAP (EUS2-C) &amp; US Central EUAP (CUS-C) regions</strong> <strong>ONLY, </strong>should go through the Canary whitelisting process. Should you receive a case for this request, redirect the customer to complete the form at <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbRwOOS1zpqSROl57b33kaymxUMlNOVVhXUDVaTEVVQTFNRFpCWUpZQjNCWCQlQCN0PWcu" managed-link="" target="_blank">Canary Onboarding (Internal Only)</a> page.</li>
	<li><strong>Note:</strong> This process is not part of the normal Capacity Team engagement. Should you have any questions about this process please reach out to your TA.</li>
	<li>FAQs about Canary Whitelisting/Quota Increases can be found below:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong>What is Canary? </strong>A single program that consists of a dedicated Azure environment (2 regions) running within Azure public capacity. Consider these 2 regions to be permanently in preview. The Azure Canary is also known as Azure Early Updates Access Program.</li>
		<li><strong>What is Canary&rsquo;s goal? </strong>Limit Livesite risk for Azure Infrastructure software changes by validating compatibility and stability of new infrastructure software releases in a subset of production regions/environments, containing carefully selected 1st and 3rd party customer workloads. Limit Livesite risk for high priority customers by allowing them to run small workload with the next version of Azure components.</li>
		<li><strong>Which are the Canary regions? </strong>Central US EUAP East US 2 EUAP</li>
		<li><strong>Who can use Canary? </strong>ASMS should typically see internal subscriptions and Offertypes that are AEUAP. External customers &ndash; 3rd parties (e.g Geico) Internal customers &ndash; 1st parties (e.g Skype) Internal Azure synthetic workloads which assess Azure from a customer perspective Internal Azure services (e.g &ndash; Portal, Monitoring, etc). There may be exceptions, but very uncommon and we will typically handle these with the PMs directly.</li>
		<li><strong>How does one onboard Canary? </strong>This is by invitation only.</li>
		<li><strong>Is there a special limit these customers will receive? </strong>This is not known in advance. Customers will be contacted if capacity is unavailable.</li>
		<li><strong>Does Canary enable Production environment? </strong>No</li>
		<li><strong>Is MSFT committed to any SLA for workloads running on Canary? </strong>No</li>
		<li><strong>Does MSFT collect Revenue from external customers for their usage of Canary? </strong>No</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Specialty SKU</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Every batch account will be allowed to use either Standard SKU&rsquo;s or Specialty SKU but not both. Customer requests to increase Batch quota for Specialty SKU&#39;s (NCSV2, NCSv3, NC, NV) will have to create a new batch account just for the specialty SKU&#39;s.</li>
	<li>Once the Batch Quota is stamped on the new account, the new batch account will be limited only to Specialty SKU&#39;s (NCSV2, NCSv3, NC, NV) and will not be available for other generally available SKU&#39;s (Av2, Dv2, Dv3, Ev3, DSv2, DSv3, ESv3, F, FS, BS, Eiv3, ESiv3). Single new batch accounts can be used for multiple Specialty SKU&rsquo;s (NCSV2, NCSv3, NC, NV).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>SPOT / Low-Pri quota</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Low-Priority/SPOT VM quota is controlled at the Region level only, any requests for Low-Priority VMs should have a Region Limit ticket created for fulfilment. (Low-pri/SPOT has it&#39;s own template in the capacity OneNote).</li>
	<li>SPOT is only available for user on Modern, EA or PAYG only.&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/spot-vms#channel</li>

<h3><a name="Workflow_Process"></a><strong>Workflow Process</strong></h3>

<p><a name="Before_the_Case_Comes_to_You"></a><strong>Before the Case Comes to You</strong></p>

<p>All compute cores requests go through QMS. If the quota increase is within the current thresholds, QMS approves that request. If the request is outside of the threshold for QMS, the case is moved to the ASMS queue. An ASMS SE then owns the communication with the customer (only use the verbatims from the tickets when answering about quota) and collaboration with CM 24x7 team and/or core approvers.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>QMS will automatically close a case 48 hours after it was opened if both of the following conditions are true:</p>

<ul>
	<li>All tickets on the Support Request are closed.</li>
	<li>There have been no communications from the customer.</li>
	<li>This potentially means that a case can be closed by QMS prior to a customer response to your FQR.</li>
	<li>All other types of cases come directly to ASMS.</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Step_1:_Review_the_Customer’s_Request_an"></a><strong>Step 1: Review the Customer&rsquo;s Request and Account Information</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Carefully look through your customer&rsquo;s case, verbatim, and communications in Service Desk.</li>
	<li>Check if the customer requires special case handling, as outlined in the<em> Specific Support Guidance</em> TSG (<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/4039985">4039985</a>).&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Suspected Fraud</strong> &ndash; For cases that are flagged with &ldquo;Suspected Fraud&rdquo;, check the account&rsquo;s status in CMAT and the communication section in Service Desk.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>If the account status is <strong>Disabled </strong>or <strong>Warned</strong>, engage HIT.</li>
		<li>If the account status is <strong>Active</strong>, proceed as normal.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Check the case for any CM24x7 tickets.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Check to see if the <em>Status</em>&nbsp;is set to&nbsp;<strong>Incomplete</strong>, and the ticket is&nbsp;a<em>ssigned to</em>&nbsp;<strong>CM24x7</strong>. If both of these are true, send an email to CM24x7 with a request to check&nbsp;the&nbsp;ticket. &#8203;&#8203;&#8203;<br>
		(Typically we would expect a ticket in an Incomplete state to be assigned to ASMS&#8203;&#8203;.)</li>
		<li>If the DevOps&nbsp;ticket is not assigned to you, add your alias to the title of the ticket. (It should resemble the example below.)<br>
		That way, once the ticket has been assigned to an ASMS SE, CM24x7 can assign it to the respective case owner.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Example:</strong><br>
		Update the title to read&nbsp;<strong>&quot;SQL DB | Region Enablement &lt;US East 2&gt; | &lt;SE Alias&gt;&quot;</strong></li>

<p><a name="Step_6:_Engage_Capacity_Management_to_Re"></a><strong>Step 6: Engage Capacity Management to Request a Quota Increase</strong><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> When an ASMS SE assigns a quota request to the CM24*7 team after fulfilling the quota request, the CM approver may assign the TFS ticket back to the QMS, triggering an automated closure of the SR.</p>

<p><a name="Create_RDQuota_Tickets"></a><strong>Create RDQuota Tickets</strong></p>

<p>In most cases QMS/Automation will have created all the tickets for the case already. Make sure that the tickets have been correctly created. If one or all of the tickets are missing, follow the below steps to create them.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://aka.ms/quotatickettemplates">Ticket Templates</a> Ticket Templates(OneNote) page.</li>
	<li>Select the appropriate template from the<strong>Ticket Templates</strong> page.</li>
	<li>Read the <a href="https://aka.ms/rdquotaguidelines">RGuidelines</a> for your template type.</li>
	<li>Fill out your ticket using both your customer&rsquo;s information and the guidelines mentioned in the previous step. Keep the following in mind as you fill out your TFS tickets:
	<ul>
		<li>If the ticket is for a <strong>Premier</strong> customer, add &quot;Premier&quot; to the title of your ticket.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>This allows Capacity Management to prioritize the ticket appropriately.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Only one region can be selected per ticket.</li>
		<li>Only one Azure Service (Compute Cores/SQL/Storage) can be selected per ticket.</li>
		<li>Compute Cores &ndash; Only one VM Type can be selected per ticket.</li>
		<li>Region/Service/Service Type selection can be made through drop-downs.</li>
		<li>If the ticket is a new compute request (that has not been through QMS and didn&rsquo;t require a credit check) you should assign the ticket to the <strong>Quota Automation Service (QMS)</strong>.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>If it does require a <em>credit check</em> or has already been through <em>QMS</em>, assign it to <strong>CM24x7</strong>.</li>
			<li><strong>Important: </strong>If the case requires multiple tickets, ensure all ticket numbers are listed as part of the case.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Save</strong> button.</li>
	<li>Once you click the Save button, a ticket number should appear in the Ticket Details section of the DevOps ticket<br>
	<strong>Important:</strong> Be sure to document the <strong>Ticket Number</strong> in your case.</li>
	<li>Check back in on your ticket on a regular basis to determine if resolution has been provided, or if next steps are needed.<br>
	<strong>Protip:</strong> To ensure that customers get the information of their completed quota increase request as soon as possible, every SE should enable and leverage the notifications feature. You can follow this link showing how to <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ASMS/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B7ECAB685-3BD1-443B-A35A-B7CDC32BFB5B%7D&amp;file=Enable%20TFS%20notifications%20for%20WACAP%20tickets.docx&amp;action=edit&amp;mobileredirect=true">Enable Quota Increase Notifications</a>.</li>
	<li>If the customer asks any questions, be sure those questions get added to the capacity management ticket so that capacity management can review and answer them.</li>
	<li>Once your ticket has been updated by Capacity Management, communicate the solution or next steps with your customer and update the <strong>SR Wait State</strong> and <strong>Solution</strong> tasks accordingly.</li>
</ol>

<p><a name="Step_7:_Following_up_on_Your_RDQuota_Tic"></a><strong>Step 7: Following up on Your Ticket</strong></p>

<p>Capacity Management tracks tickets through the <strong>State</strong> and <strong>Status</strong> fields (hereafter referred to as the <strong>State/Status</strong> of your DevOps ticket.) There are several circumstances provided below in which you will need to follow up on tickets. (In all cases where you need to act, the ticket will be assigned to you with messaging from Capacity Management regarding what they expect of you.)</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2834676#Ticket%20State">Ticket State</a> and <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2834676#Ticket%20Status">Ticket Status</a> tables provided at the end of this section are informational and are not intended to be comprehensive. Capacity Management will assign the ticket to you when you need to act on it. Do not change the status of a backlogged ticket just to get an update, if CM noted a timeframe and that timeframe hasn&#39;t elapsed yet, you can add a note in the ticket, but don&#39;t change status.</p>

<ol>
	<li>When a quota ticket is assigned to you in <strong>Incomplete </strong>state, provide the requested clarification to Capacity Management in theticket. Change the state filed to <strong>In Triage</strong> and update the field <strong>Assigned to </strong>as<strong> CM 24*7</strong>.</li>
	<li>Make sure to answer all questions raised by capacity management to avoid delays.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>If the quota is no longer required and you are closing the SR, find all the tickets associated to your SR, no matter who its assigned to and no matter what state it is in (unless fulfilled), change the state to <strong>Cancelled</strong>, add proper notes to explain capacity management why you are canceling it and <strong>Save</strong>. Do not leave the SR in <strong>Incomplete</strong> status.</p>

<p><strong>Circumstance 1: </strong>How to find Quota tickets assigned in your name in Incomplete state</p>

<p>You can run a simple query to identify quota tickets assigned in <strong>Incomplete </strong>state. Follow the steps below to run the query:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Navigate to the following URL:&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.azure.com/CapacityRequest/Quota/_queries/query-edit/89fe4b15-70ce-49ab-aade-ddc8ad28daa9/">https://dev.azure.com/CapacityRequest/Quota/_queries/query-edit/89fe4b15-70ce-49ab-aade-ddc8ad28daa9/</a></li>
	<li>Select Assigned to: &lt;your name&gt; and select State: <strong>Incomplete</strong></li>
	<li>This query will list all the tickets assigned in your name in <strong>Incomplete</strong> state.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Circumstance 2:</strong> How to find a Quota ticket in the Incomplete status associated to a SR.</p>

<p>You can run a simple query to identify quota tickets associated to a SR. Follow the steps below to create a query:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Navigate to the following URL:&nbsp;<a href="https://dev.azure.com/CapacityRequest/Quota/_queries/query-edit/a8f60bad-17ed-40ab-9ae4-907f23d0f671/" managed-link="">https://dev.azure.com/CapacityRequest/Quota/_queries/query-edit/a8f60bad-17ed-40ab-9ae4-907f23d0f671/</a></li>
	<li>Update the desired SR number in the highlighted field as shown in the screen shot below, to find the associated <strong>Incomplete</strong> tickets and click on <strong>Play</strong> symbol to execute the query.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Circumstance 3:</strong> Ticket is assigned to you as <strong>Complete/Fulfillment Actions Completed.</strong></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>Confirm with your customer that their quota has been increased.<br>
	The customer can see the updated quota by clicking the <strong>Refresh</strong><strong> </strong>button on the<em> Usage+quota</em> page in the Ibiza Portal. Please note that this page must be manually refreshed, in order to see the updated quota. &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li class="indent-1">If your customer confirms their quota increase, set the ticket State to <strong>Closed</strong>. You may then move to closing your customer&rsquo;s Service Desk ticket as per the <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2834676#Coding%20and%20Closing%20Procedures" target="_self">Coding and Closing Procedures</a> section.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">If your customer cannot confirm their quota increase, after refreshing their portal, add a note in the ticket that the customer cannot see their increased quota. Change the State to <strong>In Review</strong> and assign it back to Capacity Management.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>All other circumstances:</strong> If a ticket is assigned to you outside the circumstances listed above, Capacity Management will provide you with next steps as needed.</p>

<h3><a name="Engagement_and_Escalation_Path"></a><strong>Engagement and Escalation Path</strong></h3>

<h4>Handling Escalations from Internal teams</h4>

<p><span><span>&#8203;If an <em>account team</em> or a&nbsp;<em>field representative</em> escalates&nbsp;a&nbsp;quota or capacity-related scenario&nbsp;to you, refer them to <a href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https://gethelp.corp.microsoft.com/&amp;data=02%7c01%7cmievan%40microsoft.com%7ca40546c4e1d940584cb108d758cc884d%7c72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7c1%7c0%7c637075507790772715&amp;sdata=BiTlJ2nosSyx9tbveiOcZvXvt%2BpgdlKf73kwOP%2BgCEM%3D&amp;reserved=0"><strong>Ge&#8203;tHelp</strong></a>. </span></span>T<span><span>hese escalations will then be addressed by the Capacity Management team within a business day.</span></span></p>

<h4>Escalating to CM 24*7 for Quota issues</h4>

<p>For quota increase cases where you have not received a response by CM 24*7 within a 1 to 4 hour timeframe, you can contact them directly at CM24x7@microsoft.com&nbsp; and <em>Cc</em> ASMSCMPOC@microsoft.com.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you still don&#39;t receive a response after emailing the above aliases, escalate to your TA or&nbsp;PTA following the normal process. In return, they will escalate to the ASMS internal POD queue.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Reminder&nbsp;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not email or ping CM 24*7 engineers directly.</li>
	<li>Do not loop in customers, TAM&#39;s or any other internal or external parties to that email exchange.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If a ticket is backlogged and the customer is asking for an ETA, address the customers ask with CM 24*7. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Do not email SCM or Azure global.</li>
	<li>Do not email American, EMEA, or APAC customer operations.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
