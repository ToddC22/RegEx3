<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This TSG provides guidance on how to execute a subscription ownership transfer (SOT).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: When a SOT is not applicable, a simple or forced migration may be required. Refer to the following TSGs for guidance: <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/2856526" managed-link="" target="_blank">Simple Migration </a> or <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/2892044" managed-link="" target="_blank">Forced Migration</a>.</p>

<ul>
</ul>

<p><strong>Applies To: </strong>All customers.</p>

<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<p>Customers may contact support for assistance with transferring either the services or the billing of their subscription from one account to another. In these instances, inform the customer that these actions are self-serve and can be performed by following the steps outlined in the public facing document: <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer" managed-link="" target="_blank">Transfer billing ownership of an Azure subscription to another account</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Billing-only SOTs performed by SEs for customers must be done in CST.</p>

<p><span>If the customer has already attempted the self-serve option but experienced an issue, you can assist the customer by performing the SOT on their behalf. Before doing so, you should note the following:&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Ensure the customer&#39;s subscription is listed as one of the </strong><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-subscription-transfer#supported-subscription-types" managed-link="" target="_blank">subscription types supported for SOTs</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>The following legacy subscriptions and scenarios are not eligible for transfer of ownership:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Free Trial subscriptions.</li>
		<li>SOTs from Azure Commercial to Azure Government (Fairfax) and vice versa.</li>
		<li>Cloud Solution Provider Partner (CSP) administrators are not allowed to transfer Reserved Instances (RIs) between partners.

		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Azure in Open (AIO) subscriptions.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">

		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Destination&nbsp;Account&rsquo;s Azure Access Pass is a&nbsp;Free Trial and is in an Inactive state due to the Cap State being expired.</li>
		<li>Destination Account&rsquo;s Azure Access Pass is Paid but the Azure Access Pass is in an Inactive state due to Dunning/Overdue Invoices.</li>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In these scenarios, there is an option for the customer to select or de-select transferring outside of their organization. Have the customer de-select this option and the transfer will go through.</p>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<p>In instances where the customer is unable to complete a SOT via the&nbsp; self-serve option in the portal, or we need to execute a SOT as a workaround, follow the steps below:</p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN">Step1: Determine if the customer&rsquo;s subscription is supported by SOT. </span></strong><span lang="EN">See list of supported subscriptions </span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/understand/subscription-transfer#supported-subscription-types" managed-link="" target="_blank">here</a><span lang="EN">.&nbsp;</span></p>

	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span lang="EN">Step 2: Confirm the customer&rsquo;s intentions. Do they want to transfer only the billing, or both the billing and services?</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN">Step 4: Verify whether the customer&#39;s accounts are part of the <em>same tenant</em> or if they are on <em>different tenants</em>.</span></strong></p>

</ul>

<p><span lang="EN">Transferring services and billing from one account to another when the accounts are on different tenants has serious effects that <strong>the customer must be aware of prior</strong> to the SOT. If you observe that your customer&rsquo;s accounts are on different tenants, note the following:</span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>Share the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Active Directory Documentation</a> article with the customer to help them identify AAD dependencies.

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><strong>Note:</strong> If the customer is unable to find any AAD dependencies, you can try reviewing the customer&#39;s usage report. If there are still questions or concerns after reviewing the customer&#39;s usage report or hearing back from the customer, engage your TA/PTA/TL for further assistance.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The following resources could be impacted by an SOT with an AAD tenant:</li>
	<li class="indent-1"><strong>Azure AD Domain Services</strong> are unable to be transferred or migrated as this is a feature tied to a specific AAD tenant.</li>
	<li class="indent-1"><strong>Azure Key Vaults</strong> could be impacted by a SOT if the tenant ID for these resources are not updated.

	<li class="indent-1"><strong>App Services</strong> configured with AAD authentication could be impacted.</li>
	<li class="indent-1"><strong>Note: </strong>If your customer has specific service questions about the above list, they will need to contact technical support to help them understand how to manage the potential impact, after the ownership change or directory change.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Circular SOTs occur when an SOT is performed from account A to B, and then back from B to A. When this is performed, the Subscription Tenant ID does not automatically change and causes access issues for customers. In these situations you should work with your TA, who will follow the guidance in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/3188107" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 3188107</a> to update the Tenant ID.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><span>Billing Only SOT and Legacy Background</span></strong></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span>In Azure, there have always been separate &lsquo;containers&rsquo; for <strong>Resources</strong> (Service Administration) and for <strong>Billing</strong> (Billing Administration). Until July 29, 2019, these containers have been linked in all operations. Support engineers operate on the Billing container in CMAT, which affects the Resource container. </span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span>This new &ldquo;Service Administration Transfer&rdquo; feature checkbox, in both CST and in the Self-Serve experience, for SOT unlinks the Resource and Billing containers from each other.</span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span>That means an SOT <strong>without the Resource</strong> container transfers <strong>only the Billing</strong> container to the destination tenant. The Resource container remains in the original tenant. The RBAC controls in the destination tenant now apply to the Billing container, while the RBAC controls in the original tenant now <strong>only</strong> apply to the Resource container.</span></p>

<h4><a id="Backfilling_MINT" name="Backfilling_MINT"></a>Backfilling MINT Accounts to OMS</h4>

<p>MINT accounts are not supported as part of the SOT process. To perform an SOT in these scenarios, the account must be converted to an OMS account.</p>

<p>The following scenarios may occur that require an account to be backfilled:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><span lang="EN">For external customers: </span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span lang="EN">A subscription belongs to an existing legacy MINT account and an OMS account has been created that prevents the user from seeing their old subscription. </span></li>
		<li><span lang="EN">A subscription belongs to an existing legacy MINT account, but the customer wants the subscription moved to a different account which can only be created in OMS.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span lang="EN">Internal customers</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span lang="EN"> AIRS subscription needs to be moved to a different account for security or other reasons, and a data migration is not a feasible option. </span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span lang="EN">When a backfill is required you should note the following: </span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span lang="EN">Non-Azure subscriptions on the MINT account (e.g. OMEX, XBOX, Windows Phone, Azure Store subscription) must be cancelled and deprovisioned before a backfill can be completed. Backfill will not be done for accounts that have active non-Azure subscriptions. </span></li>
	<li><span lang="EN">Subscriptions must be active to be backfilled. Disabled subscriptions must be reactivated or cancelled and deprovisioned. </span></li>
	<li><span lang="EN">The Azure profile must be complete. </span></li>
	<li><span lang="EN">You must obtain an email from the customer which confirms that the subscription can be reactivated or deprovisioned as well as confirmation they understand the implications of deprovision (i.e. customer must backup data as it is not recoverable).</span></li>
	<li><span lang="EN">If the MINT account has two or more subscriptions, the TenantID of all subscriptions must be the same. If they are not the same, you must first update them so they are the same before the backfill will be possible. For information on updating Tenants refer to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2820621" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2820621</a>. </span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span lang="EN">The backfill will change the account anniversary date to the date in which the conversion took place. Be sure to inform the customer of the billing date change, as the account anniversary date is based on when the MINT account was created even after it&rsquo;s backfilled. </span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span lang="EN">How to submit a Backfill request</span></strong><span lang="EN">: </span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span lang="EN"></span><strong><span lang="EN">Open a TFS ticket with PAYOPS team</span> <span lang="EN">using the template provided below. </span></strong>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span lang="EN"></span><span lang="EN">They will review the request and then escalate it to the OMS team to backfill the account.</span></li>
		<li><span lang="EN"></span>Each backfill TFS submission should include one and only one Azure MINT account ID and PUID. Do not submit multiple MINT accounts in one Backfill TFS. <span lang="EN"></span></li>
		<li><span lang="EN"></span>Use the following exact format with no spaces before or after the commas, the PUID Type with the words PUID or ORGPUID only, and the PUID is in decimal format.<span lang="EN"></span></li>
