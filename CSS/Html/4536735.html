			<p class="paragraph"><span><em><span><span>Unfortunately, since the action was performed on the &lt;add date of last activation of key&gt;, our team cannot provide a new token for replacement. We can work on providing replacements if the request comes to us within 30 days from the product activation date.</span></span></em> </span></p>

			<p class="paragraph"><span><span><span>You can solve this issue on your next renewal, by removing the extra licenses/seats from users to have same number of seats or less than the new token received. This action must be performed before activating the key. In case you are not able to perform this action, please reach out to us. </span></span></span></p>
