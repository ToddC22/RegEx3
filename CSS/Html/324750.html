Additionally, it is useful to be able to deploy software based on group membership. A Group Policy object (GPO) is usually applied only to members of an organizational unit (OU) to which the GPO is linked. Because a user cannot be located in several OUs at the same time, you must be able to apply Group Policy settings outside  the boundaries of OUs. This article describes how to have your software deployment policy applied to users who are not in an OU.<h3 class='sbody-h3'>Assign a program to a group</h3><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Create a folder to hold the Windows Installer package on a server.

Instead, changes are applied according to the current Group Policy update interval. You can use the Secedit.exe command-line tool to impose GPO settings upon a target workstation immediately.
