<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Guidelines determining eligibility for out-of-scope requests</h3>

<p>When out-of-scope requests are received, review the request (looking for the three items called out below) and then proceed with the request if all three items are provided. Advocates do not need to seek approval before beginning the work &ndash; advocates are empowered to make the decision based on:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>The instructions received by the requestor are super clear and straightforward &ndash; the advocate must feel confident you have the tools, training and capability to execute the request. </span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>There are no technical blockers that would limit the advocate from proceeding with the request (such as advocates who have access to the tools needed/there are no permission issues).</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>There is currently enough advocate capacity/bandwidth within the team to complete the request without negatively impacting the service level agreement (SLA) for services formally in the AES menu. Advocates are expected to check with their supervisor to see if another team member has bandwidth, or&nbsp;consider an extended SLA to complete the task</span></span></span><span>. </span></li>
</ul>

<p>Advocates will continue to make it clear that the request is technically out-of-scope and therefore the SLA is subject to the amount of work involved, using the ASD template for this situation.</p>

<p>If bandwidth is an issue and other criteria is met, please contact a supervisor to reassign the case to another advocate or to escalate to Microsoft to handle at another delivery partner location.</p>

<h3><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Out-of-scope requests: approved requests</h3>

<p>If an out-of-scope request meets the guidelines for processing, or, you have been given approval to proceed by a manager, please use the messaging in an <strong>ASD template </strong>that clearly states the request is typically/officially unsupported by BOS. The following is an example verbiage that can be tailored to communicate this:</p>

<p><span asset="4497686" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4497686]</span></p>

<p>Because there are no documented steps for out-of-scope requests (as they are outside the normal scope of the AES program), it is highly recommended you share the steps you plan to execute and obtain formal approval from the requestor of how you will be completing the work (if they have not provided you with clear guidance).</p>
