<header><h1>ASMS – Misroutes and Duplicates</h1></header><p>Submit a <a href="http://sharepoint/sites/fastrack/Lists/ModTrack/NewForm.aspx?RootFolder=">ModTrack</a> request to update this TSG.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview </strong></h3>

<p>This TSG provides guidance on how to handle&nbsp;case incorrectly sent (misrouted) to ASMS, that should be supported by another team. It also explains how to handle duplicate cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> It is crucial ASMS engineers reroute technical misroutes to the correct support team through this Misroute process as soon as possible once the case is assigned. It is also important to update the case&#39;s Routing Product to be the correct non-ASMS product and support topic. We must be sure to give the support team enough time to assign the case and meet FQR before it expires.</p>

		<li>
		<p>If you receive a duplicate case, you should follow the Quick Close scenario steps for duplicate cases&nbsp;outlined in CSS&rsquo;s <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4346835" managed-link="" target="_blank">Commercial Case Management Standards</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<ol class="indent-3">
	<li>If you receive a case&nbsp;that is a technical misroute, collect as much information as possible about the&nbsp;request from the customer and document it in the case. Be sure to also include why this case is being <span><span><span>transferred </span></span></span>and do not accept ownership of the case.&nbsp;

	<ul>
		<li>If you have already taken ownership of a case and sent FQR&nbsp;but later find that it is technical in nature, continue to collect as much information from the customer. If the case verbatim does not clearly indicate which Azure technology the customer needs assistance with, ask the customer for a brief description of the issue so that you can send the case to the right team. Add a detailed case note&nbsp;explaining why this case is no longer in scope for ASMS.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://msaas.support.microsoft.com/queue" managed-link="" target="_blank">MSaaS Queues Portal</a> to determine which&nbsp;queue the case belongs to.<br>
	<br>
	<span>If you cannot confirm the correct queue and routing information even after searching in the Queues Portal for at least 5 minutes, email the Azure DMs (</span><a href="mailto:wadm@microsoft.com">wadm@microsoft.com</a><span>) and ask them to help you find the correct queue for that case. Include all the details of the request you collected from the customer, so that the DMs can use those details to&nbsp;find&nbsp;the correct queue.</span></p>

	<li class="indent-1">Queues Portal Search Tip: Use keywords #AzurePOD or #AzureSupport for Azure Support Teams.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">You do not need to use the WhichAzureTeam alias. The Duty Managers (DMs) will do that if needed.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Service Impacting Events (SIEs) have separate queues depending on what service is affected. Let the DMs figure which queue to use.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
	<li>
	<p>Update the <em>Routing Product</em> and <em>Support Topic </em>of the case.&nbsp;When selecting the Support Topic, select the lowest level and most accurate topic (avoid Advisory) based on what you know about the customer&#39;s request.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Some teams will have multiple queues in which a case can land in,&nbsp;so accuracy is important. Do not transfer the case using the &quot;Manual Override&quot; feature.<br>
	<br>
	Be sure to also do the following before transferring :&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li class="indent-1">Change the title of the case by adding &ldquo;MISROUTE&rdquo; to the beginning of the title.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">If the user has <strong>Basic</strong> or <strong>Developer</strong> level support, adjust the severity to Sev C.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">If you accepted the case and sent FQR, then you will need to follow some additional steps:

		<li class="indent-1">Create a new Task titled &ldquo;Customer Callback Needed.&rdquo;</li>

	<li>
	<p>Once you have transferred the case,&nbsp;let the customer know (using the preferred contact method indicated in the case) that you have transferred the case to the correct queue.</p>

	<ul>

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> If you receive pushback from one of the Azure Technical teams that they won&#39;t accept a support case opened as a Billing/Subscription case, please contact <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:kimlftedr@microsoft.com" target="">kimlftedr@microsoft.com</a> with the case number and ask for assistance.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the customer emails you back or creates a new ticket with ASMS stating that they did not receive a response on the technical ticket within the expected SLA, do the following:&nbsp;</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Email the DMs at <a href="mailto:wadm@microsoft.com">wadm@microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;and ask them to check on the transferred case, as the customer has yet to be contacted. Be sure to provide them the case number of the transferred case.</p>

		<li>
		<p>If discovered that the case has not been assigned,&nbsp;email <a href="mailto:azuresvcsic@microsoft.com">azuresvcsic@microsoft.com</a> so that the technical DMs can assign the case.&nbsp;</p>
