<header><h1>A “Netlogon event ID 5719” event message is logged when you start a Windows based computer</h1></header><div class='kb-symptoms-section section'> When you start a Windows based server, Event Viewer may record an event that resembles the following: <div class='sbody-error'> Netlogon Event ID 5719:<br> No Windows NT Domain Controller is available for domain<br> <strong class='sbody-strong'>&lt;domain_name&gt;</strong>.<br> The following error occurred:<br> This event is expected and can be ignored when booting with the No Network Hardware Profile. </div><br>After the server logs this event at startup, you can log on to the domain normally. The event occurs when you start the computer. This event may repeat frequently if the Windows OS needs to setup communications with other domain controllers. Windows 2000 Server and later domain controllers are highly impacted and may log thousands of 5719s in the system event log. <br><br>Additionally, the Windows “Service Control Manager” may report the following condition after repeated NETLOGON 5719 events, if the “System Center Management service” is installed: <br><div class='sbody-error'>Log Name: System<br>Source: Service Control Manager<br>Date: &lt;Date&gt; &lt;time&gt;<br>Event ID: 7036<br>Task Category: None<br>Level: Information<br>Keywords: Classic<br>User: N/A <br>Computer: &lt;servername&gt;<br>Description: The System Center Management service entered the stopped state. </div><br>This entry may be seen in the netlogon.log file after a reboot if Netlogon Debug Logging is enabled on the computer generating the Netlogon error event: MM/DD HH:MM:SS [INIT] Netlogon.dll has been unloaded (recover from it). <br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span> To enable Netlogon Debug Logging simply run the nltest.exe command shown in Step 6 of MSKB 109626 and restart the service.
