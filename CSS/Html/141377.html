This article describes the differences between the two utilities for each Windows NT-based operating system.</div><div class='kb-moreinformation-section section'><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Windows NT 3.x</h3><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Regedit.exe</h4>Regedit.exe is the registration editor for 16-bit Windows. It is used to modify the Windows registration database. The database is located in the Windows directory as Reg.dat. The database contains information about 16-bit applications, and is used by File Manager for opening and printing files. It is also used by applications that support Object Linking and Embedding (OLE). Reg.dat is used and maintained by Windows on Windows (WOW) and 16-bit Windows applications. The WOW layer resides on top of theVirtual DOS Machine (VDM).<br><br>Regedit.exe is a 16-bit application that is included in Windows NT for compatibility with previous 16-bit applications. Regedit provides a method for examining Reg.dat under Windows NT. You can migrate the Reg.dat database file to the Windows NT registry during the first logon to aninitial installation of Windows NT.<h4 class='sbody-h4'>Regedt32.exe</h4>Regedt32.exe is the configuration editor for Windows NT. It is used to modify the Windows NT configuration database, or the Windows NT registry. This editor allows you to view or modify the Windows NT registry.The editor provides views of windows that represent sections of the registry, named hives. Each window displays two sections. On the left side, there are folders that represent registry keys. On the right side, there are the values associated with the selected registry key. Regedt32 is a powerful tool. You must use extreme caution when you use it to change registry values. Missing or incorrect values in the registry can make the Windows NT installation unusable.<h3 class='sbody-h3'>Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000</h3><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Regedit.exe</h4>Regedit.exe is included with Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 primarily for its search capability. You can use Regedit.exe to make changes in the Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000 registry, but you cannot use it to view or edit all functions or data types on Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000.<br><br>The following limitations exist in the Regedit.exe version that is included with Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000:<ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>You cannot set the security for registry keys.</li><li>You cannot view, edit, or search the value data types <strong class='sbody-strong'>REG_EXPAND_SZ</strong> and <strong class='sbody-strong'>REG_MULTI_SZ</strong>. If you try to view a <strong class='sbody-strong'>REG_EXPAND_SZ</strong> value, Regedit.exe displays it as a binary data type. If you try to edit either of these data types, Regedit.exe saves it as <strong class='sbody-strong'>REG_SZ</strong>, and the data type no longer performs its intended function.</li><li>You cannot save or restore keys as hive files.</li></ul>Microsoft recommends that you use Regedit.exe only for its search capabilities on a Windows NT 4.0-based or Windows 2000-based computer.<h4 class='sbody-h4'>Regedt32.exe</h4>Regedt32.exe is the configuration editor for Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 2000. Regedt32.exe is used tomodify the Windows NT configuration database, or the Windows NTregistry.
