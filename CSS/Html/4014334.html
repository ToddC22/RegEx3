<h3><span>What</span><span> is this article about?</span></h3>

<p>This article explains how to use the Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (SDT) and the Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business (SDT4B) as an additional <strong>requirement</strong> to current troubleshooting. This should be followed when a customer is contacting us about their Surface device running Windows 10. If troubleshooting steps prior to that guidance resolves the issue, then SDT or SDT4B is not required, but can be used optionally to add value.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> SDT and SDT4B do not work on Surface Duo.</p>

<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. SDT use exceptions</h3>

<p>SDT or SDT4B is required on every repair order that is setup unless the issue is related to one of the exceptions:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Devices running Windows 8.1 or earlier.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Customer induced damage scenarios (for example, cracked screen or broken kickstand).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>No network connectivity as the tool requires an internet connection.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Issues where the device will not turn on or boot to Windows.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Issues where SDT or Windows Update is not a troubleshooting step (for example, Microsoft Account Forgotten Password or Pen requires a new battery).</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Overview</span></h3>

<p>The Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (SDT) and the Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit for Business (SDT4B) resolves the most common Surface issues.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> For the rest of this article, except when needed, SDT will mean either SDT or SDT4B as appropriate based on customer&rsquo;s segment.</p>

<p>SDT is downloadable by the customer and can take 10-15 minutes to complete if their device is up to date with all Windows Updates.</p>

<p>The automated tool pinpoints and auto heals issues that can contribute to or cause the symptoms the customer is facing. SDT4B allows the customer to create a support request directly from the tool and includes device information and diagnostic logs, so you can begin troubleshooting right away.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>There are four versions of this tool:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>All <span><span><span>devices running Windows 10 (not in S mode) should download and use the executable (.exe) version of the toolkit appropriate for their customer segment. See <span><a bookmark-id="3.1" href="#3.1" managed-link="">section 3.1</a> </span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span>for appropriate links.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span>Consumer only: Surface Laptop running Windows 10 in S mode should download the app version from the Microsoft Store since executable files won&rsquo;t install on a device running Windows 10 in S mode.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>If SDT is not listed in the troubleshooting steps, but Windows Update is, then SDT should be run in place of Windows Update.</span></span></span></strong> </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>SDT is <strong>required</strong> on every repair order that is setup unless the issue is related to one of the exceptions in <a bookmark-id="1" href="#1" managed-link=""><span>section 1</span></a>. <strong>Requirement:</strong> The reference ID (19 digits) under the Telemetry section must be recorded in case management notes after the SDT diagnostics have run in the customer&rsquo;s device.</span></li>
	<li><span>If a customer indicates that they have already run SDT, have the customer start SDT and on the&nbsp;<strong>Telemetry</strong>&nbsp;tab, verify that the last run was within the last five days. If not within the last five days, the customer will need to carry out a new diagnostic run.</span></li>
	<li><span>If SDT does not resolve the customer&rsquo;s issue, the next step is to continue standard troubleshooting, or the device reset step.</span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Follow the steps and guidance provided in the <a bookmark-id="3.1" href="#3.1" managed-link=""><span>section 3</span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span>, for specific situational handling instructions</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>If either of the following conditions are true then include a link to SDT, in any email you may send. SDT may resolve the customer&rsquo;s issue without need for further support or device servicing. See <span><a bookmark-id="3.1" href="#3.1" managed-link="">section 3.1</a> </span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span>for appropriate links.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The customer is out of warranty (OOW) and declines the paid diagnostics offers.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The issue is resolved with standard troubleshooting steps before SDT is used.&nbsp;Providing the information about SDT can be a value add for the customer</span></span></span></span><span>.</span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span>3. Procedures</span></h3>

<h4><a id="3.1" name="3.1"></a>3.1 SDT download</h4>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The online page does not provide screen sequence instructions.&nbsp;If customers ask questions about specific screens, refer to KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4456776" managed-link="" target="_blank">4456776 Tool User Guide: Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (SDT)</a>&nbsp;and access the training content. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Follow existing troubleshooting steps for the customer&rsquo;s issue but <strong>stop</strong> at the step where you would install Windows Updates and run SDT instead.</p>

<p><span><span>Messaging:</span></span><br>
<br>
<span><em>&ldquo;Please download and run this program on your device. It is a self-healing tool which looks for potential issues and fixes them, as well as ensures your device is completely up to date. The tool takes about 10-15 minutes to run and is a requirement for progressing your repair order. I&rsquo;ll send you an email with the link now.&rdquo;</em></span></p>

<h4><a id="3.2" name="3.2"></a>3.2 Customer objects to using SDT</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the customer objects, highlight that running SDT is a requirement as part of our device repairs process and running SDT will avoid potential extensive delays if the device requires repairs.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Stop</strong> repair order steps if the customer refuses the tool usage and advise the customer that you cannot proceed with the repair request unless SDT diagnostic information (Run ID and date) is provided. </span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><span><a id="3.3" name="3.3"></a><span><span><span>3.3 Customer agrees to using SDT</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p class="indent-1"><span>1. If the customer agrees to proceed, continue with the following and set expectations:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span>The tool takes 10-15 minutes to run unless the tool resolves a Windows Update issue and there are additional Windows Updates that need to be installed.</span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span>Let the customer know that if the tool does not resolve the issue that there are some additional troubleshooting steps that can be done which may include the need to reset the device.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>2. Walk the </span></span></span><span><span><span>customer through the steps to download and install the tool. See<a bookmark-id="3.1" href="#3.1" managed-link=""> </a><span><a bookmark-id="3.1" href="#3.1" managed-link="">section 3.1</a> </span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span>for appropriate links.</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span>3. Remain on the phone/chat until SDT starts to download Windows Updates. </span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span>If a <strong>Windows Update is pending</strong>, inform the customer that you will send an email with the link above so that the customer may finish the SDT steps completely.</span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span>If the <strong>device is already up to date</strong>, Windows Update may not initiate &ndash; in which case stay on with the customer to finish the steps. If the customer asks to be called back, schedule a call back.</span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span>If the <strong>customer is running Windows 10</strong> in S mode on their Surface Laptop, the executable version of Software Repair Tool will not install or run. In this case:</span></li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li class="indent-2"><span>Have the customer use the app version (<a href="http://aka.ms/surfacerepairuwp" target="_blank">http://aka.ms/surfacerepairuwp</a>) available in Microsoft Store&nbsp;instead. </span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span>The app needs to run as Administrator. <strong>Start</strong> menu &gt; find <strong>Software Repair Tool</strong> &gt; right-click &gt; Select <strong>More</strong> &gt; Select <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2">If <strong>the customer does not want to stay on the call</strong>, send the customer an email with this link (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/surface-diagnostic-tool?icid=agent_SDT" target="_blank">Fix common Surface problems using the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a>) which provides step by step instructions. Let the customer know there can be a callback to check on the status of their issue and whether the tool helped resolve it. If the customer refuses a callback, offer to send the customer an e-mail and request they reply with the outcome.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>4. </span></span></span></span></span>In case the customer requests a callback and contacts us first, leave notes in the <strong>Comments</strong> field<span><span><span><span>:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>This error message indicates that the customer did not run the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit (SDT) within the <strong>last five days</strong> or did not complete<em> </em>the running of SDT. If the customer did not run the SDT tool yet, have them do so and then create the order again. If the customer is calling back after having been provided these instructions by a different advocate, ensure that the notes are complete, and the customer completed running SDT without issue.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>If the customer claims they already ran SDT or is unable to do so,&nbsp;<strong>consult with a Tech Lead</strong>&nbsp;on next actions. Note that you may see an MST problem type of&nbsp;<strong>SDT Bypass (Requires Approval)</strong>, which is <strong>not</strong> to be used unless a Tech Lead reviewed and approved use.
