<p><span><span><span><span><span>Submitted ad groups will undergo a review to make sure that they meet Microsoft Advertising policies. The ad and keyword editorial review is a quality check to make sure that ads are well written and relevant to users&#39; searches.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>After new ads or keywords are saved, advertisers can see details of the review process in the <strong>Delivery </strong>column. In most cases, ads and keywords are reviewed in a timely manner and are live soon after they are submitted. The review could take longer if the ad or keywords do not meet Microsoft Advertising Policies. In these situations, additional review of ads and keywords could take several hours or as long as several business days.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="4.2" name="4.2"></a>4.2 Inline appeals</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>An inline exception is also known as an inline appeal, it gives advertisers the ability to appeal a rejected ad or keyword without the need to contact a support advocate. The advertiser can click on a rejected ad or keyword and simply request an appeal. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Inline appeals are now also allowed at the Ad Group level. Ad Groups with same ID can be appealed inline only once.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>In most cases, advertisers will not need to contact support for requests to create an inline appeal. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If an advertiser is inquiring about the disapproved keywords and has <strong>not submitted </strong>the inline appeal yet, educate the advertiser about the submission steps in the user interface or Editor (Editor) as well as how they will be alerted on a decision. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising UI:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Users can access inline appeals directly from both the Ad and Keyword tabs in the Microsoft Advertising user interface by clicking on the <strong>ellipsis </strong>(<strong>...</strong>).<br>
	Bulk inline appeals are available in the UI. To do a bulk appeal, select the rows you wish to appeal, select <strong>Edit</strong> and then select <strong>Request exception</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>To submit the appeal, the user must provide justification as to why they feel Microsoft Advertising should consider an exception and click the <strong>Request exception</strong> button.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Note</strong>: Advertisers should avoid using general or vague justifications in their request for an exception. For example, &quot;Approve my ad&quot; instead of focusing on the justification/need.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Once justification has been given the user then clicks the <strong>Request exception</strong> button.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>When the inline appeal is submitted, the Delivery status changes to &quot;Exception under review&quot; and it is sent for manual review.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>After the manual review has taken place, the status will automatically update in the UI to reflect the decision made by the editor. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>An email is also sent to the submitter, advising them of the decision on their inline appeal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
Editor (Editor):</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Only disapproved content can be appealed using Editor. </span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>When discussing the delivery issues possibly caused by the QBR score, discuss relevancy and landing page/site quality with advertisers and how improving both would improve the delivery. Use the talking points in this article specific to the QBR Classifications.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Be sure to refer the advertiser to our <span><strong>Relevance and Quality Guidelines</strong> </span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span><span>whenever discussing any information related to quality and/or relevance. One of the key components to provide an effective experience for advertisers and a relevant experience for consumers is to help ensure our team reviews the quality of keywords, ads and landing pages.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>QBR is an assessment of quality, relevance and risk, and includes an assessment of:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>﻿The manual review process occurs when ads are &ldquo;Pending.&rdquo; Most ads and keywords that enter our system go live immediately. A small percentage need evaluation and might (PMA Live) or might not (PMA Not Live) serve while they wait for an editor to assess them.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For example, the word &ldquo;caliber&rdquo; is most usually associated with guns, but an advertiser might assert &ldquo;our customers get the highest caliber of service,&rdquo; in their ad copy. Although we don&rsquo;t allow guns in most markets, there are non-weapon uses of the term that can be compliant with policy. Whenever there&rsquo;s ambiguity about or risk associated with a term, it goes to PMA. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="6.1" name="6.1"></a>6.1 PMA expedite process</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If ads/keywords are found by the requestor to be pending editorial review, there is an option to send an expedited request for immediate processing. If an advertiser asks about the status of an ad, the L1 advocate should immediately verify how long ad has been pending by asking the advertiser. If it has been longer than the typical PMA SLA or if the advertiser expresses urgency about getting ads or keywords live (such as for a large sale), submit a <strong>PMA Expedite request</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

They will correspond with you but not directly with the customer. If additional details are required, the <strong>Editorial team</strong> will request additional information via the ticket.

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Check the status of the service request (SR) frequently (at least once each business day).

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Once the pending items have been reviewed, ensure that you do not have any questions before going back to the advertiser.

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The ads/keywords are compliant, but in order to start delivering, the advertiser must make a small change to each affected entity (such as adding a space) and then resubmit.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="7" name="7"></a>7. Bypass/exceptions requests</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>&ldquo;Bypass&rdquo; is an internal term only. Use terms like &ldquo;exception&rdquo; or &ldquo;system update&rdquo; when communicating with advertisers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Important:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Remember that bypasses only work for future submissions and have no effect on content has already been submitted.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
Bypass scenarios:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
If your advertiser is experiencing any of the following issues, consider requesting a bypass:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Cannot load term into campaign: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>The advertiser is experiencing an error message and/or is unable to save an ad/keyword that contains a particular term. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Recurring PMA or long term PMA: </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The advertiser is experiencing additional review time for the same term(s), which result in approvals most of the time. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The advertiser experiences a long review period with certain terms, which eventually result in approvals most of the time.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
Bypass criteria:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Customer level: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Bypasses are granted at the customer level; all accounts under a given customer must be eligible for the requested bypass for it to be granted. To be approved for bypass, the term must be something that will always be approved for that particular advertiser across all of their accounts.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Risk assessment: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Note the potential for risk by allowing a bypass for terms that fall into editorial high risk areas: Adult, Pharma, Trademark and Gambling. Pay special attention to bypass requests that fall into these categories and review the Microsoft Advertising Policies to help inform. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Relevance and Quality:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> This is a main component that is evaluated against all bypass requests. Although a term might not present a high risk business area (for example: adult, pharma), it is critical that the term is highly relevant to the advertiser&rsquo;s ad content, business model and user&rsquo;s search query. For example, if an auto insurance or software download advertiser is bidding on terms like &ldquo;Obama&rdquo; or &ldquo;Justin Bieber,&rdquo; this bypass would not be granted because there is not a direct relevance. In addition, sites must be of good quality to be eligible for a bypass. Any low quality indicators that you may see behind QBR penalties or Spam rejections would prevent a bypass from being granted.

	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Provide as much context and background as possible: </span></span></span></strong></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>What is the advertiser&rsquo;s justification for needing a bypass? </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Be sure to provide details on the advertiser&rsquo;s business model and how it works. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>How many times has the term in question gone through PMA? Have they experienced any delays? </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Is the advertiser having issues loading the term initially? Describe the steps they took and what errors they are encountering.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Advertisers may contact support requesting a specific ad or ads be pulled from serving.

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="8.1" name="8.1"></a>8.1 Trademark, copyright &amp; counterfeit ad pull requests&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Advertisers are responsible for ensuring that their use of keywords and ad content, including trademarks, does not violate the intellectual property rights of others. Trademark owners are responsible for contacting advertisers directly if they believe that their trademark is being used improperly.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If a trademark owner believes his/her trademark is being used improperly, instruct them to do the following: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Contact the advertiser directly and ask them to stop using their trademark term in any way that violates Microsoft Advertising&rsquo; Policy.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Submit an ad pull request via the Trademark misuse form on the </span></span></span><span><a href="http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/intellectual-property" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span><span>Intellectual Property concern page</span></span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>. As of March 27, 2017 Microsoft Advertising no longer investigates trademark complaints at the keyword level for any market apart from Hong Kong and Taiwan.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
Talking points:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;Microsoft Advertising strives to bring high quality relevant ads to its users, and it employs robust systems to ensure that ads on the Microsoft Advertising Network are compliant. However, we welcome feedback regarding ads that violate our policies. Feedback can be submitted only through the ad pull request form&rdquo;.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em>We take these complaints very seriously. If the ad is in violation of our polices, it will be removed from the network.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><br>
If the advertiser says they have already filled out a complaint form and no action was taken, look at the ad in question.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If it is within policy guidelines, take the time to explain the policy to the advertiser and discuss why this ad meets policy guidance.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If it is not within policy guidelines, encourage the advertiser to submit another ad pull request form, and provide the following talking point:<br>
	<br>
	<em>&ldquo;It looks like this ad is in violation of our policies. To alert the Editorial team, please fill out the ad pull request form and include all required information. Sometimes one ad is pulled, and the advertiser loads a similar ad to the network. The Editorial Ad Quality Team is not at liberty to proactively pull certain categories of ads or monitor an individual advertiser in response to an ad pull request</em>.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The ad and keyword editorial review is a quality check to ensure that ads are well written and relevant to customers. After submitting an ad group, the content goes through an initial review to ensure that it meets the Microsoft Advertising Policies. The editorial status of ads and keywords can be found in the <strong>Delivery </strong>column on the Ads or <strong>Keywords </strong>tab of the Campaigns page.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To help ads and keywords pass the editorial review, see the Best practices to avoid disapprovals and Disallowed products and services blog posts.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In most cases, ads and keywords are reviewed promptly and should be available online soon after being submitted. The review takes longer if:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The ad or keyword list contains questionable words. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The advertised website is inaccessible. The website contains information that is unrelated or not allowed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In these instances, additional review of ads and keywords could take a few hours or several business days.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To expedite resolution, submit an escalation to UCMT <strong>Tier 2 Receiving Team</strong> = Network Quality Services (NQS) &gt; <strong>Sub-Team</strong> = Appeals.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The SLA for standard priority can be up to <strong>five business days</strong>, so set expectations with the advertiser before escalating.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="12" name="12"></a>12. FAQ</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What determines how soon ads are live? Why is my content taking so long to review? How come questionable content can be approved for one advertiser, but not another?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> All new content that is loaded into advertiser&rsquo;s accounts goes through a series of checks before it goes live. The system can detect that some content is low risk, and therefore it goes live right away. Other content that may pose a risk is sent to a team of editors for manual review. During this time, the status of the ads or keywords will show as &ldquo;Pending Editorial Review&rdquo; until a decision is made by the editors. On average, the manual review will take 24 to 48 hours. Can you please tell me when you created your ads/keywords?<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: If the content has been in Pending status for over 48 hours, submit a PMA Expedite request on the customer&rsquo;s behalf.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I am losing customers and revenue during the review process. How can you justify this?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Microsoft Advertising policies contribute to high quality advertising. These policies are important for delivering the results that search users want and ensuring a positive, safe experience on our network. The editorial review process helps promote a high quality, low risk user experience that leads to higher click through and conversion rates.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Do you offer credits or refunds for the revenue that I am losing?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> No. We do not offer credits or refunds for editorial review concerns. However, during a review period, ads and keywords that are not serving are not billed. We know that your time is valuable, and we strive to minimize editorial or system delays and get your ads serving as quickly as possible.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Why am I unable to load my ads or keywords? Is there anything that you can do to help me?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>If you cannot load an ad or keyword and it meets our </span></span></span><span><a href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51003/0" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span><span>technical requirements</span></span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span> (for example, length is less than 100 character, and no prohibited special characters), one or more of the terms you&rsquo;re using could be considered high risk by the system based on our Microsoft Advertising policies. All content must comply with our guidelines to ensure a positive, safe user experience on our network. If you feel your content is compliant with our policies, we want to help you get everything live. Let me take a look at your account. Can you please tell me the error message you receive when you try to upload the ads and/or keywords?</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Will my ads be reviewed every time that I make a change?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> If you make any changes to an ad&rsquo;s title, description, display web address or destination address, the ad again undergoes the editorial review process. If the content is compliant with Microsoft Advertising policies, it will go live immediately.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: My ads were previously live on Bing, but now they are disapproved. What is the reason for this?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The content serving on our network is continuously reviewed to ensure a positive, safe user experience. Additionally, our Microsoft Advertising policies do change. Content that was previously compliant with our guidelines can be determined to pose a risk. If you disagree with the decision, you can submit an exception request to have the content reviewed again.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I have two ads that are very similar, however one is approved, and one is not. Also, the ads lead to the same landing page. How can this be?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> We have a variety of systems in place that proactively monitor our network for quality, relevance, and user safety. Some of those checks occur after ads and keywords have been initially approved. Keywords and ads individually and in combination may undergo different types of review; it&rsquo;s possible for similar keywords and/or ads within the same ad group to have different statuses. Ensure that all keywords and ads align with Microsoft Advertising policies, including our Quality and Relevance Guidelines.<br>
If the ads are almost identical, the reason for the disapproval on one ad could be due to our duplicate ads policy. This policy was put in place to prevent duplicate ads from the same advertiser serving on the same term to ensure variety in the marketplace.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Q: Why do I still see other ads showing for XYZ when my ads have been rejected?<br>
A:</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span> &ldquo;User safety and network quality are top priorities, and we will review any ad quality or policy complaints reported through the low quality ad submission form against our policies. We encourage you to submit a complaint form if you feel that other advertisers are violating our policies.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>
