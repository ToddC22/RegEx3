<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>1.&nbsp;Overview</h3>

<p>This procedure outlines how to identify whether a customer has a Surface device that has a possible expanded or swollen battery, how to create the appropriate order for the customer&rsquo;s region, and messaging that needs to be provided to the customer. Be sure to read these articles in order, Overview, Repair Specialist steps (if you are a Repair Specialist), and finally Creating an expanded battery order. The Expanded battery examples and Additional support articles provide extra detail if needed.</p>

<p>Deviation from these steps will cause the case to be incorrectly handled and could cause delays for the customer. Deviation from these steps could also cause Microsoft to be out of compliance with couriers and local governments.</p>

			<p><strong>Why is my device only covered for 3 years under this policy?</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><em>We wanted to do right by our customers and therefore have implemented this policy which allows customers to seek the replacement of their devices, if they experience battery expansion up to three years from the date of purchase. This policy does not extend the warranty of the product but allows for an exchange beyond Microsoft limited warranty period.</em></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Is a device with an expanded battery a safety concern?</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><em>There is no inherent risk or safety concern associated with these expanded batteries. With that said, like alkaline and other batteries, the lithium ion batteries used in Surface devices contain materials that can injure skin, eyes, and lungs if&nbsp;punctured.</em></p>
			</td>

		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Can I continue to use my device?</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><em>We recommend that customers not continue to use a device with an expanded battery, except where the Surface operates only on battery power and for the purposes of data transfer. Surface devices with expanded batteries should not be connected to AC power as it could possibly lead to rupture.</em></p>

			<p><em>Ensuring you have the latest Surface updates; confirming your device&#39;s fan vents are not blocked or obstructed; avoiding charging of your Surface in direct sunlight or other high temperature environments; and only charging your Surface with the included power charger or a compatible, original Microsoft power charger to minimize the potential for battery expansion.</em></p>

<h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Case coding</h3>

<p>When a customer contacts support about a possible expanded battery process, create the case, gather the basic information, and then transfer to a repair specialist. Repair specialists are the <strong>only&nbsp;</strong>advocates that can provide a resolution for the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Consumer:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a case and complete the taxonomy using the following options:</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>Feature</strong>: Surface Devices</p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>Topic</strong>: Battery</p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>Scenario</strong>: Battery</p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>Issue</strong>: Expanded/Swollen Battery</p>

<ol start="2">
	<li>Add appropriate notes to the case.</li>
	<li>Continue to <a bookmark-id="4" href="#3" managed-link="" target="">Identifying an expanded battery</a>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Commercial:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Create the case and code the symptom as an Expanded Battery as outlined below:</li>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>Surface &ndash; Device</strong></p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>Battery and Charging</strong></p>

<h3><a id="4" name="4"></a>4. Identifying a device with an expanded battery</h3>

<p>An expanded battery can be described as an expanded battery, swollen battery, exploded battery, or as a raised, lifted, separated, or bulging screen. If the customer describes their issue with any of these words, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Confirm with the customer that they are at least 13 years of age.
	<ul>
		<li>If under 13 years of age, ask to speak with someone in the household that is at least 13 years of age. If no one of age is available, offer to call the customer back.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If not already done, ensure the case is created, coded, and documented using the directions in Case Coding.</li>
	<li>Inform the customer that to move forward we need them to provide a clear <strong>video </strong>of the Surface showing the issue along with the serial number on the device. Provide the customer with a link to DTM so they can upload the video there to be reviewed. Due to the size of a video, the customer will likely be unable to email those to the case and must use DTM. DTM can accept up to 100 GBs per instance. To provide the customer with a link to DTM refer to KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4135034" managed-link="" target="_blank">4135034: Tool User Guide: Data Transfer &amp; Management (DTM)</a>.&nbsp;

	<ul>
		<li>The&nbsp;videos provided by the customer <strong>must </strong>include the following:

		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>A clear view/angle of the Surface that shows the expansion.</li>
			<li>A clear view of the serial number.</li>
			<li><strong>Note</strong>: The video should contain both the expansion and serial number in one continuous video. The customer should not include them separate, if possible.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If the customer has multiple devices with an expanded battery the customer can include all devices one video, but each device in the video must still show both the expansion and the serial number.</li>
		<li>If the expansion is difficult to capture in the video have the customer follow the below steps which will help show the issue. You can find example pictures of how this should look in the video in KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4511542" managed-link="" target="_blank">4511542 Procedure: Surface: Expanded/Swollen battery or bulging screen: Expanded battery examples</a> (<strong>do not </strong>share this example picture with the customer).
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Lay the Surface on a flat table with the screen facing up.</li>
			<li>Place a straight, flat edge (like a ruler or something similar) directly on the screen or part of the Surface where the bulge is happening.</li>
			<li>Take&nbsp;a video of the Surface showing the expansion from the side, then remove the flat edge, rotate the Surface over and video the serial number.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Inform the customer that the case will be transferred to a Repair Specialist to provide a resolution.</li>
	<li>Engage a Repair Specialist (or your sites equivalent) following the <strong>appropriate process</strong> for your site. The Repair Specialist, or equivalent, will review the case and provide next steps.</li>
</ol>

<p>Once the repair specialist has been engaged, the repair specialist will confirm the issue and provide appropriate replacement options following the Repair Specialist steps in KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4511545" managed-link="" target="_blank">4511545 Procedure: Surface: Expanded/Swollen battery or bulging screen: Repair Specialist steps</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <strong>Do not</strong>&nbsp;promise any type of resolution with the customer, if the customer asks what will be done let them know more details will be provided after the case and video is reviewed. This includes if the device is OOW and out of policy for the three&nbsp;years. Before offering the customer any replacement options the case and videos must be reviewed first.</p>
