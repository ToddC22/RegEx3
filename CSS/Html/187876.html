<header><h1>WINUP: Not Enough Free Disk Space to Install Update Components</h1></header><div class='kb-symptoms-section section'>When you install a desktop component, you may receive an error message stating that you do not have sufficient free disk space when using Active Setup to install Windows Update components. Setup may indicate that it must have only 3,000 kilobytes (KB) of disk space to complete an installation, but then generates an error message stating that it must have 3-4 times that space to complete the installation.<br></div><div class='kb-cause-section section'>This is expected behavior. During download, the desktop component files are in a compressed format (such as the .zip compressed format) and require extra space to uncompress. After the files are uncompressed into a temporary folder, the executable (.exe) files install the theme, and then the files are removed from the hard disk. After the files are removed, there is only the original figure of 3,000 KB disk space used. This process completes automatically during installation and is not visible.<br></div><div class='kb-resolution-section section'>To install the component, increase the free hard disk space on your computer.<br></div><div class='kb-securedata-section section'>Verify that the customer has sufficient disk space, both in their Temporary Internet Files and on their hard disk. Rename the Inseng.dll file to Inseng.bak. On Windows 98 Second Edition and Windows 98, the file is located in the Windows\System folder. On Windows NT 4.0, the file is located in the Winnt\System32 folder. Have the customer re-connect to the main Windows Update Web site. From there, they can automatically download the file to their computer.<br><br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span> Do not send the Inseng.dll file to customers in e-mail. Microsoft has determined that this solution (for a different issue) is not valid because it may cause other issues. If the Web site does not download the file to the customer&#39;s computer, Windows 98 users can extract the file by using the System File Checker.</div><div class='kb-workaround-section section'>To free disk space, use any of the following methods.<h3 class='sbody-h3'>Use Disk Cleanup to Remove Files You Do Not Need</h3><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Open My Computer.</li><li>Right-click the disk you want to free space on, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Properties</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong class='uiterm'>General</strong> tab, click <strong class='uiterm'>Disk Cleanup</strong>.</li><li>Click the files you want to remove, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>OK</strong>.<br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span> You can read a description of each file type in the area under the list.</li></ol><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Use Scandisk to Look for Errors That Take Up Disk Space</h3>To look for errors that may be taking up disk space, start ScanDisk, click the drive that you want to check, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Start</strong>.<h3 class='sbody-h3'>Remove a Windows Component That You No Longer Use</h3>To remove Windows components that you no longer use, follow these steps:<ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <strong class='uiterm'>Start</strong>, point to <strong class='uiterm'>Settings</strong>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Double-click <strong class='uiterm'>Add/Remove Programs</strong>, and then click the <strong class='uiterm'>Windows Setup</strong> tab.<br><br>If you used a CD to install Windows, you may be prompted to insert it into your computer.</li><li>Under <strong class='uiterm'>Components</strong>, click the component you want to add or remove.</li></ol><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Notes</h4><ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>To add all parts of the component, select the check box next to the component.</li><li>To remove all parts of the component, click to clear the check             box next to the component.</li><li>To add or remove some parts of the component, click <strong class='uiterm'>Details</strong>, and then select or click to clear the check boxes for those parts.</li></ul><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Remove Programs That You No Longer Use</h3>To remove programs that you do not use, follow these steps:<ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <strong class='uiterm'>Start</strong>, point to <strong class='uiterm'>Settings</strong>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>Double-click <strong class='uiterm'>Add/Remove Programs</strong>.</li><li>Follow the instructions on the screen.</li></ol><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Free Disk Space by Using Drive Converter (FAT32)</h3>To free disk space by using Drive Converter, follow these steps:<ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <strong class='uiterm'>Start</strong>, point to <strong class='uiterm'>Programs</strong>, point to <strong class='uiterm'>Accessories</strong>, point to <strong class='uiterm'>System Tools</strong>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Drive Converter</strong>.</li><li>Use Drive Converter to convert your hard disk to FAT32 format.</li></ol><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Notes</h4><ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>After you convert your hard disk to FAT32 format, you cannot use the FAT16 format again until you repartition and reformat the FAT32 drive.</li><li> If you converted the drive where Windows 98 is installed, you must reinstall Windows 98 after you repartition the drive.</li><li> Older disk compression software is not compatible with FAT32.
