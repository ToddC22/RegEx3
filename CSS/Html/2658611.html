</div>

<p>This article&nbsp;provides information about<span> the Azure Pass Sponsorship</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span> offer, and guidance on how to assist customers who may contact support. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Microsoft created the Azure Pass Sponsorship </span>(243P) offer <span>to encourage potential customers to try the Azure Platform. </span>This program is widely used for sales opportunities, training scenarios, workshops, and much more.</p>

<div>
<h3><strong><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy&nbsp;</strong></h3>
</div>

<ul>
	<li>The maximum Azure Pass Sponsorship value is $1,500 per pass. Azure Pass Sponsorship requires a promo code to activate the offer.</li>
	<li>Each account is limited to one concurrent Azure Pass.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>If the customer obtains additional&nbsp;Azure Pass promotional codes, advise them that they will need to redeem that promo code after the current offer has ended or with a new account.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Azure Pass Sponsorship does not require a payment instrument (PI) or SMS check.</li>
	<li>Accounts associated with an EA enrollment are not eligible for an Azure Pass Sponsorship.</li>
	<li>Customers may have multiple Azure Pass Sponsorship subscriptions on a single account. However, all subscriptions under that A<span>ccount ID</span><span> </span><span> </span> (whether a Microsoft Account or Org ID) will use credits from the same pool.</li>
	<li><span>There is no monthly credit cap. There is only an overall usage cap (the maximum consumption value for an Azure Pass Sponsorship), which allows customers to spend Azure credits at their own pace up to the usage cap.&nbsp;</span></li>
	<li>The Azure Pass Sponsorship will end when the customer reaches either the usage cap or the duration of the subscription has come to an end, whichever occurs first.</li>
	<li><span>The Azure Pass Sponsorship offer will have the same data center and service level restrictions as the legacy (120P-130P) Azure Pass offers.</span><span> </span>

<p><span><span>In a situation where the customer&nbsp;has redeemed the code under a specific account but does not see the subscription, and the SE has verified the customer&#39;s account, instruct the customer to do the following:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>Log into the <span><strong>Accounts Portal</strong>.</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></li>

	<li><span><span>Select the Upgrade Offer<strong> (Azure Pass Sponsorship)</strong> and the subscription will activate.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;If the customer has a Free Trial active, you will need to engage your TA who will work to get the Free Trial deprovisioned so that the Azure Pass subscription&nbsp;can be activated.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><a id="Monetary Credit" name="Monetary Credit"></a>Monetary Credit </span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span>Azure Pass Sponsorship offers flexible credits. </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> Customers can use their credits at any time during the Azure Pass Sponsorship offer (similar to the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/3014508" managed-link="" target="_blank">36P Sponsorship</a> </span></span>offer<span><span>). </span></span>Promo codes can be redeemed on the&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure Pass</a>&nbsp;site.</p>

<p><span><span>You can use AIRS to look up the Account ID to verify if the customer has an Azure Pass Sponsorship. If the customer redeems the Azure Pass Sponsorship promo code with an incorrect Microsoft account ID, they will need to contact their <span>internal Microsoft contact</span></span></span><span> </span><span><span> who issue them the code</span></span><span> </span><span><span> to recieve a new promo code. </span></span></p>

<p>Use the steps below to verify a customer&rsquo;s Account ID: &nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go to the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/airs" managed-link="" target="_blank">AIRS site</a>.</li>
	<li><span>Click on <strong>Sign in</strong>.</span></li>
	<li><span>Click on <strong>List Registrations.</strong></span></li>
	<li><span>Uncheck box titled &ldquo;Pending business desk approval&rdquo;.</span></li>
	<li><span>Under Account owner Live id &ndash; enter the <strong>Email</strong> in which the sponsorship was granted and select the <strong>Equals</strong> radio button underneath the text box.</span></li>
	<li><span>Click on <strong>Filter</strong> and then click on the tab under the &ldquo;#&rdquo; symbol to run the query.</span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><span><span>Ask the customer if they already redeemed the pass with their account ID via the </span></span><span><a href="http://www.microsoftazurepass.com">Azure Pass</a></span><span><span> website:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>If yes, the customer will need to attempt to redeem the subscription via the Azure Portal. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>If not redeemed, instruct the customer to follow the prompts to redeem the promo code.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>If you need to contact the Azure Pass team for further assistance,&nbsp;&nbsp;you can send a task to the <strong><span>Azure Sponsorship Offer </span></strong>queue. </span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><a id="Azure Pass Subscription and Ownership Transfers" name="Azure Pass Subscription and Ownership Transfers"></a>Azure Pass Subscription and Ownership Transfers</span></span></span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN"><span>SOTs of Azure Pass subscriptions from one account to another are not supported. Performing a subscription transfer will cause the subscriptions end date to reset; allowing the customer to continue using their services without paying. All new monetary credit Azure Pass subscriptions will have a subscription end date and will not allow for renewal. </span></span></p>

<p>However, should the customer need to tranfer thier services to a new account, we can suggest a migration instead. I<span>f the customer decides to use this workaround, follow the guidance in the migration section below.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN"><span>Example:<em> </em>If you have a 12 month pass that expires tomorrow on 7/16/19, and an SOT is performed on 7/15/19, the new subscription end date will be 7/15/20. Resetting the subscription end date and allowing the customer another year of service. </span></span>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><a id="Converting Existing Subscriptions to Azure Pass Sponsorship" name="Converting Existing Subscriptions to Azure Pass Sponsorship"></a>Converting Existing Subscriptions&nbsp;to Azure Pass Sponsorship</h4>

<p>I<span>t&nbsp;is not possible to convert an existing subscription to an Azure Pass Sponsorship.</span></p>

<div>
<h4><a id="Converting Expired Azure Pass Sponsorships to Another Offer" name="Converting Expired Azure Pass Sponsorships to Another Offer"></a>Converting Expired Azure Pass Sponsorships to Another Offer</h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Expired Azure Pass Sponsorship subscriptions (243P) will not be automatically converted to Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG).&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>If there is no PI and the&nbsp;customer wants to re-enable the subscription&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>after it was disabled at the end of their term, the subscription can still be converted to a<span>&nbsp;PAYG</span></span></span><span><span>. At this time, the&nbsp;<span>customer</span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>will need to remove the monetary cap, add a credit card to re-enable the subscription. I<span>f the customer doesn&rsquo;t have the self-serve option, ASMS may need to re-enable the subscription on their behalf. </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>See TSG</span></span> <span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/2647585" managed-link="" target="_blank">2647585</a> for guidance on how to convert a subscription.</span></span></p>

<p>For guidance on adding a credit card, reference <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card" managed-link="" target="_blank">Add, Update, or Remove a Credit or Debit Card for Azure</a>.</p>

<p><span><span><span>If the Azure Pass subscription is disabled and a migration to an EA subscription or <span><span><span>another offer (<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/offer-details/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Offer Details</a>) that doesn&#39;t require a credit card needs to occur, you can do the following:&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Engage the Azure Pass team to have them provide a second pass with $50 of usage so that the subscription can be re-enabled during the migration phase and then disabled again, once complete. &nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span> </span></span> <span><span>EA customers with an active EA enrollment cannot sign up for Azure Pass Sponsorship subscriptions.</span></span></p>

<h4><a id="Data Migration" name="Data Migration"></a>Data Migration</h4>

<div>
<p><span><span>If a customer requests a data migration, confirm if the customer purchased the Azure subscription using the same MSA ID. Once confirmed, you can work with the customer&nbsp;to perform a data migration. </span></span></p>

<p>As stated above SOTs are not supported for this offer type. <span lang="EN"><span>The workaround for this, is to have the customer request a new promo code from the resource that originally provided them the code. Once approved, the following will need to take place:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span lang="EN"><span>The customer will need to create a new Azure Pass Subscription using the new code.</span></span></span></li>
	<li>The customer will need to activate the code using a new Azure Account.&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>The customer&nbsp;will not be able to activate another Azure Pass under the same account until the current offer has ended, due to the design of the system.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span lang="EN"><span>An ASMS engineer will perform a data migration of the services from the old pass subscription to the new one. </span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span>For guidance on performing a simple data migration, reference </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2856526" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2856526</a></span><span><span> and for performing a forced migration, reference </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2892044" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2892044</a></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<h4>Azure Pass Extensions</h4>
</div>

<p><span>If a customer requests to have additional credits or time added to their Azure Pass Sponsorship, direct the customer to their Account Rep or Azure Pass Distributor. These types of requests are at the funding discretion of the Microsoft employee who distributed the code. The user will need to redeem a new promo code if the Azure Pass already ended.</span></p>
