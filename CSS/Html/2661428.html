<h3><strong><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>This TSG provides guidance on how to assist a customer who is requesting to cancel their Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) or transfer their EA Account from EA to non-EA.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</strong></h3>

<p>EA customers may contact support for assistance in cancelling or dissociating their EA account or subscription from an enrollment.<br>
<br>
In these instances, leverage the following guidance that best aligns with your customer&rsquo;s request.</p>

<h4><a id="Customer Cancels Their EA and Leaves the Azure Platform" name="Customer Cancels Their EA and Leaves the Azure Platform"></a>Customer Cancels Their EA and Leaves the Azure Platform</h4>

<p>Use the following steps when an EA customer requests to cancel their EA contract or subscription and does not wish to stay on any Azure platform. This includes customers who do not renew their EA at the end of their contract.</p>

<p><strong><span>Directions</span></strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>Warn your customer that any remaining balance of their annual commitment will be lost when they cancel their EA contract.</span></span></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Example:</strong> If the customer made an annual commitment of $10K and only used $8K, they will lose the remaining $2K.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Validate the customer&rsquo;s account via the <strong><span>EA portal</span></strong> (<a href="http://ea.azure.com/"><u>ea.azure.com</u></a>).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For information on verifying customer eligibility and identity, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646876"><u>TSG 2646876</u></a>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>If the account is valid, transfer the entire case to the EAO team in Service Desk.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4><a id="Customer Wants to Transfer an Account or Subscription from an EA Enrollment" name="Customer Wants to Transfer an Account or Subscription from an EA Enrollment"></a>Customer Wants to Transfer an Account or Subscription from an EA Enrollment</h4>

<p>Use the following steps when an EA customer wants to move a subscription from their EA to a non-EA account or enrollment (i.e. disconnect (unlink) the subscription from their EA).</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>Customer decides to cancel or not renew their EA but stay on the Azure platform with a regular subscription.</span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customer added an incorrect account to the EA portal, or wants to keep certain subscriptions for a specific Microsoft Account (MSA) or Personal account separate from their EA enrollment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span>Directions</span></strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>Validate the customer&rsquo;s account in the <strong><span>EA portal</span></strong> (<a href="http://ea.azure.com/"><u>ea.azure.com</u></a>).</span></span></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For information on verifying customer eligibility and identity, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646876"><u>TSG 2646876</u></a>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>In Service Desk, create a collaboration task for the <strong>Human Intelligence Team (HIT)</strong> to notify them that the EA customer is downgrading their account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The customer&rsquo;s account may be flagged as fraudulent or canceled if this is not done.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>For more information on engaging the HIT, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658538"><u>TSG 2658538</u></a>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Follow the preliminary steps outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3040383"><u>TSG 3040383</u></a><em><span> (EA account to MOSP account</span></em> section) to prepare the customer&rsquo;s subscriptions for an SOT.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Convert the EA subscription to be moved to the non-EA offer type the customer wants (e.g. PayG), using the steps outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2647585"><u>TSG 2647585</u></a>.<br>
	<strong><span><br>
	Note:</span></strong> For BizSpark, Sponsorship, MPN, MSDN or any other benefit offer, you must follow the entitlement and approval process that corresponds to that offer type before following this procedure.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Assist the customer in moving their subscriptions out of EA by performing a subscription ownership transfer (SOT) by following the steps outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3040383"><u>TSG 3040383</u></a> under <em><span>SOT from an EA account to MOSP account</span></em> from step 14 on.<br>
	<strong><span><br>
	Note:</span></strong> If the customer wants to continue to use the same account that the EA was under, they must first move all subscriptions to the other account, then remove the account from the EA. Once the customer has done that, you can move all the subscriptions back to the account that is no longer part of the EA.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
