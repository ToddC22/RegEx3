<h3 class="sbody-h3"><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</h3>

<p>Xbox customers who moved from one country to another may want to change the region in their Xbox Live account. The name for this is account migration. Customers can migrate their account to a new region through&nbsp;<a href="https://live.xbox.com/accountmigration" id="kb-link-1" target="_self">live.xbox.com/AccountMigration</a><br>
<br>
Agents are to help customers resolve account migration issues. Note that when a customer changes the region of their account and their account does not have a billing profile for the new region, the creation of a new billing profile occurs. As an effect, the billing profile for the old region will become inactive, and the billing profile for the new region will become the primary profile. Support will still be able to view the old billing profile after performing a region migration. Do not remove these old billing profiles.</p>

<h3 class="sbody-h3"><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Common issues associated with account migration</h3>
These are the common concerns some customers encounter after region migration. Customers can review them at: <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-account/change-region" id="kb-link-2" target="">change the region of your Xbox Live account</a><br>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Use the same link to help customers troubleshoot their related concerns. Do not engage <span asset="4053626" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4053626]</span> for these issues:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li><span class="text-base">Unable to perform account migration &ndash;</span> See <a bookmark-id="3" href="#3" managed-link="">Conditions Preventing Account Migration</a>, below.</li>
	<li><span class="text-base">Customer accidentally migrated account to an incorrect region &ndash;</span> The customer must wait 90 days before changing the region again.</li>
	<li><span class="text-base">Lost/inaccessible content &ndash;</span> Content from one region may not be available in another region. Content may not function when an account is migrated to a different region. We do not allow refunds for these cases.</li>
	<li><span class="text-base">Lost/missing funds in the Microsoft account &ndash;</span> Local currency does not transfer from one region to another after region migration. The currency is still in the account. However, it is only viewable and accessible if the account is reverted to the original region.</li>
	<li><span class="text-base">Downgraded subscription/membership to Xbox Live -</span> Gold Membership can be lost if the account is migrated to a region where Xbox Live is not supported. <span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>See </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.xbox.com/live/countries" managed-link="" target="_blank">Xbox Live countries and regions</a><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span class="text-base">Lost Groove Music Pass &ndash;</span> Groove Music Pass is canceled after migration.</li>
</ul>
<strong><span class="text-base">Note:</span></strong> Xbox 360 Customers can change regions again after 90 days from the first region migration for example, if they are unhappy with the loss of content, a subscription, or Microsoft Account funds.<br>
<br>
Xbox One customers do not need to revert the Xbox Live account to the old region/country to access lost content. Customers using Xbox One can change the language and location on the Xbox One console to access their purchased content in other regions.<br>
<br>
The following guides are available to customers:<br>

If a customer calls in and reports that they are unable to migrate their account, determine the conditions that are preventing migrating the account and provide or perform the appropriate advice or action. You can find these conditions at <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-account/change-region" id="kb-link-6" managed-link="" target="_blank">Change the region of your Xbox Live account</a>.
