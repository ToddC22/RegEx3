<h3><span><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Verification process</span></h3>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>To create a business listing in Bing, users must verify that they either own or are a legitimate representative of the business. After adding business details in the Bing Places dashboard and selecting <strong>submit</strong>, users will be taken through the verification process. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the verification process is successful, the listing is marked as verified and is submitted for publishing. See KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3138298" managed-link="" target="_blank">3138298 Process: Bing Places: Publishing Cycle</a> for further details.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Verification options<a class="ms-asset-internalBookmark" id="Options" title="Options"></a></span></h4>

<p><span>Bing Places provides users a list of verification options. The option provided is based on whether the business is new or if it already exists in Bing.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Postal mail</span></li>
	<li><span>Email</span></li>
	<li><span>Phone</span></li>
	<li><span>Text (SMS)</span></li>
	<li><span>Online (only available in EN-US)</span></li>

</ul>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Regardless of the verification method chosen, customer listings will initially be placed in <strong>Review</strong> status &ndash; this allows time for the listing to be automatically or manually reviewed. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>This process can take up to <strong>four</strong> business days. Do not escalate for listings stuck in review status, unless you have seen this still in effect after five or more business days from the point of listing claim/creation. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>If you change the phone number, this will trigger a postal mail verification request.</span></li>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>When a Bing Places user creates a new business listing, they will be presented with verification options: email and postal mail. Email verification is recommended as PIN delivery is faster than postal mail.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Recommended&nbsp;verification is by email.</span></li>
	<li><span>Default&nbsp;verification is for postal mail.</span></li>

The customer can receive the verification PIN at the business address by postal mail.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="10" name="10"></a>10. FAQ<a class="ms-asset-internalBookmark" id="FAQs" title="FAQs"></a></h3>

<p><strong>Q: What if the customer has a company website and public email address, but the domain registrant does not verify ownership?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A: </strong>Let the customer know that we can send the PIN to a company email account and request a company email address. Also state that the email must match the company domain. For example, if the company site is Starbucks.com, then the email must be something like name@starbucks.com.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What if the listing does not have a website or company email?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> If this is the case, the customer will need to use the postal mail verification since we are unable to verify ownership using other methods.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What if the customer wants to retrieve a PIN for a listing that is no longer in that location?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> We cannot give the PIN if the customer is no longer at that location. Escalate to GDP/BP and the team will remove the listing after validating with other source providers.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What if the customer states that we emailed the incorrect PIN?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A: </strong>The customer may have submitted the listing multiple times. Provide the PIN code for each submission and include the submission date with the PIN. Let the customer know that it was submitted multiple times and one of these PINs should work.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How long does it take to publish a listing?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A: </strong>Publishing a new listing or a modified listing can take up to two weeks (10 business days).</p>

<p><strong>Q: I didn&#39;t receive my PIN, so how do I verify my listing?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Customers do have the option to request a new PIN in the user interface by simply selecting the verify link next to their listing again. However, our support advocates can verify a listing on behalf of a customer by going through the admin verification process.</p>
