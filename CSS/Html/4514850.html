<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>This article explains how to process customer credits and refunds for Cloud Solution Providers (CSP) using the Commerce Management Agent Tool (CMAT). Read this article prior to applying any refunds or credits.</p>

<h3><strong>Policy</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>ASMS Support Engineers (SEs), Technical Advisors (TA), Partner Technical Advisors (PTAs) and Managers (M1)&nbsp;can apply credits or refunds to CSP partners if the amount is <strong>$5,000 or less (USD) in policy, per service request (SR)</strong>. The credit or refun can only be applied once per partner. Any requests above that will require approval as part of the approval workflow detailed in this document.</li>
	<li><span><span><span>All CSP credit and refund request will require a credit issue TFS ticket as part of the approval workflow detailed in this document.</span></span></span></li>
	<li>All transactions are fully audited. There will be questions if you are outside of compliance.</li>
</ul>

<h3><br>
<strong>Support Scenarios </strong><br>
<br>
<strong>Getting Approval for a Credit/Refund Request</strong></h3>

<p>Create a TFS credit/refund issue for <strong>all </strong>CSP adjustments. Follow <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/4094770" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 4094770</a> for guidance on how to submit a request. You will need to select <strong>CSP </strong>as the Azure Channel.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><span asset="4514852" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514852]</span></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> While the guidance in TSG 4094770 is related to EA, the process of how to create a credit/refund TFS still applies.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Within ASMS Empowerment</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>If the credit/refund request is for <strong>$5,000 or less (USD)</strong>,&nbsp; do the following:

	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Fill in the Approval tab with your alias.</li>
		<li>Engage your TA via a collaboration task in service desk, to validate the request (For compliance purposes). Include the TFS link in the task, so that your TA&nbsp;can easily approve.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><strong>TA&nbsp;ONLY: </strong><span>TA/M1s must validate the following details on all CSP credit and refund TFS tickets by adding their alias to the fields on the <em><span>Validation tab</span></em></span>:</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2">&nbsp;Appropriate credit scenario selected</li>
	<li class="indent-2">&nbsp;Supporting Evidence Provided</li>
	<li class="indent-2">Correct Adjustment Calculation</li>
	<li class="indent-2">Correct Approval Obtained</li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
	<li><span><span><span><span>After the validation is completed by the TA (Up to $2,500) or M1 (Up to $5,000), go to the </span></span></span><span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3084129#Processing a Customer’s Refund Request"><span><em><span><span><span>Processing a Customer&rsquo;s Refund Request</span></span></span></em></span></a></span></span><em> </em><span><span><span>section to apply the credit in CMAT.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li>Once the credit had been applied in CMAT do the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Update the status of the credit issue TFS ticket to &ldquo;Applied&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Add your alias to the Application tab.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Ensure the TA/M1 has validated the amount and updated the fields according to step #2.</li>
	<li>Once all the above steps have been completed, close the TFS by changing the status to &quot;Done&quot;.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Outside of ASMS Empowerment&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>If the credit/refund request is for <strong>above $5,000 (USD)</strong> do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create a TFS ticket and assign the credit issue status to <strong>AO Billing Pending Review queue</strong>.</li>
	<li>Once it gets reviewed and approved by AO Billing Team or above, the ticket will be assigned to PayOps for processing by AO Billing Team.</li>
	<li>You will be notified via the TFS ticket, when the credit/refund has been applied, so that you can update the customer accordingly. &nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p>You should also note the following:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Always check for open and ready balance before processing any credits or refunds to customer. Any credits or refunds processed will get adjusted with open and ready balance first and the remaining amount is what will be displayed under <strong>Charges</strong> section in CMAT.</li>
	<li>It is advisable to always issue a credit and then do a settle balance instead of directly issuing a refund to PII.</li>
	<li>If there are 20 (or more) line items that need to be credited or refunded in CMAT, work with your TA/PTA on the request.&nbsp; The TA&#39;s/PTA&#39;s have the multiple line item credit/refund option in CMAT.&nbsp; The SE will need to get any approvals (if above empowerment level of the TA) from Azure Enterprise Operations prior to taking any actions in CMAT.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Please use a browser outside of Internet Explorer (such as Chrome), per PayOps request.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Processing a Customer&rsquo;s Refund or Credit Request</strong></h4>

<p>If you are needing to process a refund or provide a credit to a customer, you should only follow the steps below <strong>after </strong>a TFS ticket has been created:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open <a href="https://cmat.tools.cp.microsoft.com">CMAT</a>.</li>
	<li>Use one of the Customer Search options to locate your customer&rsquo;s Azure account.</li>
	<li>Click on the <span asset="4345389" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345389]</span> (right facing arrow) to the right of the line item with your customer&rsquo;s account information.<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> You may have to hover over the line item with your mouse to make the arrow appear.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Billing</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Transactions</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the line item that you want to refund to the customer and click on the <span asset="4345390" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345390]</span>&nbsp;(dropdown arrow) to the right of the line item.</li>
	<li>You should see the line item expand into a section resembling the following:<br>
	<span asset="4345391" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345391]</span></li>
	<li>Check to see if <em>Can Refund</em> is <strong>True</strong>, and <em>Refunded</em> is <strong>No</strong>. (See the red boxes below.)<span asset="4345392" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345392]</span>
	<ul>
		<li>If <em>Can Refund </em>is <em>False</em>, the transaction can&rsquo;t be refunded.</li>
		<li>If <em>Refunded</em> is <em>Yes</em>, it means that the transaction has already been partially or completely refunded.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Copy the <strong>LineItem ID</strong>, <strong>Subscription ID</strong>, and the <strong>Invoice ID</strong>. (See the blue boxes below.)<br>
	You will need them for <u>Step 15</u>.<br>
	<span asset="4345393" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345393]</span></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Refund Transaction</strong>. (See the orange box below.)<br>
	This will cause the <em>Refund Transaction</em> pane to appear.<br>
	<span asset="4345394" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345394]</span><br>
	<span asset="4345395" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345395]</span></li>
	<li>In the <em>Refund Transaction</em> pane, enter the <strong>Refund Amount&nbsp;</strong>(if it&rsquo;s anything other than the full amount.)
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Important: </strong>The amount that you are refunding must be positive. Entering a negative number will charge your customer that amount.</li>
		<li>The <em>Refund Amount</em> is generally the <strong>Pretax</strong> <strong>Amount</strong>. The <em>Tax Amount</em> will automatically be calculated for the refund and does not need to be added to the <em>Refund Amount</em>.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>If you refund less than the <em>Pretax Amount</em>, explain why you did so in the <strong>Comments</strong> section.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If the <em>Refunded</em> value in <u>Step 8</u> was <em>Yes</em>, then a partial or total refund has already been applied. If a partial refund has already been applied, you can only refund the amount that is remaining of the charge.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Select a refund reason code from the <strong>Reason</strong> dropdown.
	<ul>
		<li>These codes are explained in more detail in&nbsp;<a aria-live="assertive" data-bi-name="content-anchor-link" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/3045635" managed-link="" tabindex="0" target="_blank">TSG 3045635</a>.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Select a refund option from the <strong>Refund Option </strong>dropdown.
	<ul>
		<li>For Invoice Pay customers:
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Select <strong>Refund to billing account</strong>. This will apply the credit to the customer&rsquo;s next invoice.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>For Credit Card customers (use one of the following options):
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> To apply the refund as a <strong>credit</strong> to the customer&#39;s next Microsoft invoice, select <strong>Refund to billing account</strong>.<br>
			(Only use this option if the customer still has an active order on their account .)</li>
			<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> For credit card customers who want a <strong>refund</strong> to their credit card in 10 calendar days:
			<ol start="1">
				<li>Check the <em>Charges</em> page to see if the status of the charges to their credit card show as <em>Succeeded</em>. This means the charge to the credit card was successful and you can proceed with the refund.</li>
				<li>If the status of their charges shows as <em>Open</em> or <em>Failed</em>, this means their card has not yet been charged. Do not proceed with the refund.</li>
				<li>If charge status is <em>Succeeded</em>, select <strong>Refund to Payment Instrument immediately</strong> from the <em>Refund Option</em> dropdown.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Note</strong>: Use <em>Refund to Payment Instrument immediately</em> for a cancelled subscription with no other active subscriptions on their account, or if the customer still has active subscriptions on their account but is unhappy and wants a refund to their credit card instead of a credit on their next invoice.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Select the approval needed from the <strong>Approval </strong>dropdown.
	<ul>
		<li>If you are within your empowerment level (For Support Engineers, this is $5,000 USD <strong>per SR</strong>), select<strong> Not Required</strong>.</li>
		<li><span>Any amounts <strong>above</strong> $5,000 will be applied by Payops. <strong>You should not execute a credit/refund via CMAT for these scenarios</strong> as they will be worked via the TFS you submitted to the AO Billing Team.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Enter the following into the <em>Comments </em>section:
	<p><em>&lt;Credit Scenario Reason Code (CSXX)&gt; - &lt;TFS Ticket Number&gt; </em>- &lt;<em>Your Microsoft Alias</em>&gt; - &lt;<em>Subscription ID</em>&gt; - &lt;<em>Invoice ID</em>&gt; - &lt;<em>LineItem ID</em>&gt; - &lt;<em>Additional information, such as reason justification or other useful information.</em>&gt;</p>
	<strong>Note: </strong>If you get an error in CMAT due to the <em>LineItem ID</em> looking like a credit card number, you can remove the <em>LineItem ID </em>from the <em>Comments</em>.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>right arrow</strong> <strong>button</strong>.</li>
	<li>If you selected <strong>Approval: Required</strong>, you will be prompted to select approvers for your transaction.<br>
	Select your approvers based on your selections in the <em><a bookmark-id="Getting Approval for a Customer’s Refund Request" href="#Getting Approval for a Customer’s Refund Request" managed-link="">Getting Approval for a Customer&rsquo;s Refund Request</a> </em> section.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> check <em>All approvers</em>.</li>
	<li>Enter the <strong>Service Request Number</strong> from your case into the <em>Service Request Number</em> field.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>check mark button</strong> to complete the credit/refund transaction. You will see a new line item noting your credit/refund when you return to the <em>Transactions</em> page.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Inform your customer that it will take 7 &ndash; 10 business days for them to receive their refund or credit.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Important: </strong>If your transaction required an approval, note that approval requests are only active for 7 days. If they are not approved within that window, this process must be restarted. (See the <a bookmark-id="Checking the Approval Request Status" href="#Checking the Approval Request Status" managed-link=""><em>Checking the Approval Request Status</em></a> section for information on checking the status of your approvals.)</p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Be sure to let the customer know how they can verify that a credit or refund has been processed.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">If a refund to a credit card was processed, let them know it can take up to 10 business days to appear.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">They will see the credit/refund under <strong>Adjustments</strong> in their next invoice, which may take up to 30 days to be generated.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Important: </strong>Make sure you have updated the credit issue TFS ticket with the below for any credits you applied in CMAT.&nbsp;</p>

<ol start="21" style="list-style-type:decimal">
	<li>Update the status of the credit issue TFS ticket to &ldquo;Applied&rdquo;&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Add your alias to the Application tab.</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>CMAT Credit Reason Codes</strong></h4>

<p>The <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/Azure_Ops_Billing/Azure%20Ops%20Billing%20Sp%20Site/Credit%20Policy/Azure%20Credit%20Policy.pdf?csf=1&amp;e=UKvcmk">Business Group Reason Code</a> document <span lang="EN-IN">provides you the reasons for a <em>credit</em>,&nbsp;and the rules and limitations&nbsp;you use when giving a refund/credit. </span></p>

<p>Below is a visual of the Empowerment and Exception Process followed when determining and issuing customer credits:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Checking the Approval Request Status</strong></h4>

<p>If you want to see the status of your Requests, you can click the <strong>Requests</strong> tab in CMAT. (See screenshot below.)<br>
<span asset="4345396" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345396]</span></p>

<p>This view can be used to filter for requests you have submitted (<em>My requests</em>), and requests assigned to you&nbsp;(<em>Assigned to me</em>).</p>

<h4><strong>Correcting an Incorrect Credit Amount Applied to an Account</strong></h4>

<p>If you make a mistake applying a credit to an account, you can reverse the credit in CMAT yourself. To do so:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Verify the line item to be reversed displays a negative amount.(If the amount to be reversed is positive, you can process it as a normal credit.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Reversals can only be completed on a line by line basis. Do not combine lines into a single refund.<br>
<strong>Secondary Note:</strong> If in doubt about how to reverse your credit, engage your TA for assistance.</p>
