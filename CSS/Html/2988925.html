Typically, you can locate the specifics in section 16 of the </span></span></span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/storedocs/terms-of-sale" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Terms of Sale</span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>.

This return policy is provided in addition to any legal guarantees or other statutory return rights that you may have under law (see Product Warranties section below). Subject to our return criteria, after purchasing an eligible product you may withdraw from the purchase contract and request a refund without giving a reason within thirty (30) calendar days. <strong>The withdrawal period will expire after thirty (30) calendar days from delivery.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span><span>To exercise your right of withdrawal, you must inform us of your decision before the withdrawal period has expired.

			<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you exercise your right of withdrawal, we will refund the amount you paid for the products and their delivery to you (with the exception of the supplementary costs resulting from your choice of a type of delivery other than the least expensive type of standard delivery offered by us). The refund must generally be made to the original method of payment. You must return the related products to us without undue delay (no later than 14 days from the date you initiate your return request) and at your expense.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span><span>As a condition of return, and to the extent permitted by law, the following requirements apply.

Packaged software and packaged games must be returned with their seal intact and must include all media and product keys.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

			<p><span></span><span><span><span><span>Surface educate the customer on how to open a ticket at the support website. The customer can also call 1800-MICROSOFT (1-800-642-7676). The customer should follow the prompts for the issue and focus their answers on repair rather than sales or return. This will ensure they get to the correct department.</span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> There is a price difference for out of warranty (OOW) Xbox One/Xbox One S customers when setting up their repair online vs via assisted support.
