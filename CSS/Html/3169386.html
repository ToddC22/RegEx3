<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The fraud status, formerly known as dot fraud, indicates an account has been closed for fraudulent behavior as defined by Microsoft Advertising policies. Fraud closures happen at the customer level and affects all ads under the customer shell.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Internal users can see the fraud status, and closure reason in a variety of tools. Advertisers cannot see this status. Their experience is suddenly being locked out of their Microsoft Advertising account, and having all ads stop delivering.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>New account creation should never be proactively suggested to get the advertiser back on Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Fraud issue codes should always be used to close tickets for fraud accounts if the account is flagged, even if the fraud customer is contacting Support for a different reason.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>To collect appeal information for a chat or email interaction, create a Data Transfer Management workspace for the ticket (see KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4056786" managed-link="" target="_blank">4056786 Microsoft Advertising: Data Transfer Management</a>) and request the customer complete and upload the <span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/StandardSupport/l1resources/EUk4T0U-EzdOoMKGdhxhTPcB50e734kymYaASDgn2K-IWg?e=gWSbYq" managed-link="" target="_blank">Account Review Form</a>.</span>&nbsp;These details can be collected real-time via phone.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><span><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. How to tell if an account is impacted by fraud, and locate the reason for the closure</span></span></span></span><span> </span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As of November 1st, 2020, customer accounts impacted by account closure will be notified via email. Internal users can determine and confirm an advertiser has been impacted by fraud, and find the reason for the closure, using several different tools.</span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Start by verifying the advertiser in Ad Inquiry, because this is the only tool that shows the <strong>fraud pending</strong> status. Once you have confirmed the status in Ad Inquiry, use either the Microsoft Advertising UI or the UCM Agent Workspace to find the fraud closure reason.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Ad Inquiry </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>- The fraud status and closure reason can be determined on the <strong>Campaign Items</strong> tab. Look up the account using the XID. If the advertiser is impacted by fraud, it will show in red under the <strong>fraud status</strong> section.<br>
	<br>
	Ad Inquiry is the only tool that shows the <strong>fraud</strong> <strong>pending</strong> status. The other two show the account as active. If the account is impacted by <strong>fraud</strong>, not <strong>fraud</strong> <strong>pending</strong> proceed with finding the closure reason in one of the two tools below.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising UI</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> - The fraud status and closure reason can be determined from the advertiser search results on the main page. You can look up the customer by name, or account number. If the advertiser is closed for fraud, the status will say <strong>fraud</strong>, and there will be a reason in the <strong>fraud reason</strong> column. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>UCM Agent Workspace</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> -&nbsp;The fraud status and closure reason can be determined on the <strong>Alerts</strong> tab. Search by the advertiser name or customer ID (CID) in the main search page. If the advertiser is impacted by fraud, the status will show in red next to their customer name, and the closure reason will be displayed in the description column.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Once you locate the fraud closure reason, proceed with the steps below that map to the closure reason. Code the ticket based on the individual fraud closure reason and outcome.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you see that ads are not delivering but are eligible in Microsoft Advertising UI, and you receive the following error message in the inline preview tool, escalate to&nbsp;<strong>Ad Platform &amp; Tools</strong>. Refer to the<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://sharepoint.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/sites/StandardSupport/l1resources/default.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">&nbsp;Escalation Guide</a>&nbsp;for sub-team details.</span></span></span></span></span><br>

	<li><span><span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The <strong>fraud pending</strong> status is different than the regular <strong>fraud</strong> status.

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ensure the advertiser has added their preferred payment method and created at least one campaign (with an ad and keywords) to be eligible for delivery (for prepay accounts, ensure funds have been added).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the advertiser has added a payment method/funds and is still under <strong>fraud</strong> <strong>pending</strong> status, inform the advertiser that a specialist will review their account and get back to them within 24 hours.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Messaging</strong>: <em>&ldquo;It appears your account may be in a pending state on the backend. I just need to gather a few details from you to help get your ads live.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Submit the issue specific details to Fraud for review.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Advise the advertiser they are on a temporary hold and you&rsquo;ll get back in touch with them on the status of their account as soon as possible, likely same day.

<p><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;Dear &lt;advertiser name&gt;,</span></span></span></em></span></span></p>

<p><em><span><span><span><span><span>The following is regarding hxxp://www.xxx.com, which is part of your Microsoft Advertising account. Please DO NOT visit this website as it has live malware, which will be executed simply by visiting it. Please remediate the issue following the template below.</span></span></span></span></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><span><span><span><span>Troubleshooting tips for remediating malware infections</span></span></span></span></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><span><span><span><span>There are three primary ways your website might be serving malware. Listed below is a description of each one, along with helpful tips on addressing the problem.</span></span></span></span></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Malware might be directly hosted on your webpages. Malware might also be embedded in images, binaries, documents, and the HTML page itself.</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>How to fix:</strong> Inspecting the files located on the web server is a good start. An antivirus scan might reveal malware embedded in binary, document, or image files. Malware embedded in an HTML page might hide itself from antivirus products within obfuscated JavaScript. Such code is identifiable as it often contains long sequences of characters with a custom de-obfuscation routine. Deletion of any bad JavaScript or corrupted files disinfects your website. If you find such changes to the original webpages saved on your web server, it might indicate that your web server security is vulnerable. Change your passwords, update the server&#39;s operating system and your web server applications with the latest security updates, and if applicable, scan your website development computer for malware.</span></span></span></span></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Malware might be pulled into your website by links to untrustworthy third-party content, such as images, user generated content, advertisements, counters, blog templates, web widgets/gadgets, and RSS feeds. </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>If any linked third-party content is malicious, your webpage is also considered malicious, because a user browsing to your webpage from the Bing results webpage might be harmed.<br>
<strong>How to fix:</strong> Inspect the third-party content of your website and, if necessary, remove it. Only embed content from trusted third parties into your webpages.</span></span></span></span></span></em></p>

<p><em><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Malware might be injected into your webpage as it travels from your web server to the end user. </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>In this case, a direct inspection of the original webpage source code files on your web server would likely reveal no malware infection. However, by revealing and examining the source code within your web browser for the flagged webpages after either browsing directly to your website or by clicking the Cached page link for your webpage on a Bing search results webpage and comparing the results to the original file from the web server, you might detect changes to the webpage code. If you see new or modified webpage controls, modified links, or scripting changes between the original source and the browser source versions of the webpage, your website might be a target of a malicious man-in-the-middle attack.<br>
<strong>How to fix:</strong> Shared hosting providers have been known to be vulnerable to such attacks. If the source code comparison test shows suspicious differences that appear like the malicious modifications mentioned above, inform your web hosting provider that they might be the victims of a man-in-the-middle attack. If no action is taken by your provider as a result, consider moving your website to a more trusted provider.</span></span></span></span></span></em></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Use the chart below to determine whether further action can be taken to process adjustments and issue refunds for accounts closed for fraud. For declined online credit memos, see the<strong> </strong>process below this matrix&nbsp;<span><span><span>in <span><a bookmark-id="14.2" href="#14.2" managed-link="">section 14.2</a>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Important notes regarding .Fraud refunds and refund eligibility:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Treatment of remaining prepay balances at time of account closure vary by payment method, for example:</span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span>Online payments are typically auto-refunded. Failed refunds to online payment methods must follow matrix below.</span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span>Offline payments&nbsp;<strong>will not</strong>&nbsp;auto-refund. If .Fraud customer contacts CSS for their remaining prepaid balance to be refunded, CSS must initiate this in the UI (or via SANOPS&nbsp;if over 10K or over one year since payment was made).</span></span></span></li>
		<li>Any offline refunds must be approved by the Fraud team prior to sending to SANOPS for offline refund request.</li>
		<li>Customers who claim that they did not received online refunds, should be directed to their financial institution before escalating to Global Support for investigation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span>The matrix below is ideal scenario based on billing option and fraud reason codes.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Discrepancies with auto-refund/reversal treatment can vary based on system discrepancies or multiple .Fraud reason codes (AdInquiry will only show the final reason code).</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Concerns </span></span>around who is receiving the refund, amount, refund request history, or legitimacy of refund requested should be escalated to Fraudads for investigation.</span></li>

<p><span><strong><span>Updated </span>fraud <span>process for declined (online) credit memos</span></strong><span>:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span> Always advise customers with a failed&nbsp;<strong>online</strong>&nbsp;credit memo or customers claiming online credits were not refunded as expected, to first contact their financial institution.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span> Await customer response <strong>before </strong>proceeding with any further investigation. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span> If a customer states that they have validated with their financial institution that funds were not received, but the UI shows it as successful, send a request for investigation to Global Support with UST/PayOps:</span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span>Request Global Support investigate where the funds reside (with Microsoft <strong>or</strong> within the customer&rsquo;s bank) and request that they provide a customer-facing tracking number for reference, so that the customer can follow-up with their bank: </span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>Tracking number provided. <strong>Yes</strong> - Provide tracking to customer and advise them to contact their bank to investigate.</span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>Tracking number provided. <strong>No</strong> - Ask customer for bank statement or communication confirming funds were not received.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
	<li><span><span><span> Await customer response in <strong>step 3</strong> before proceeding to next step.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span> If the customer comes back with documentation from their bank confirming that funds have not been received (written confirmation, bank statement), let them know you will provide this evidence for consideration.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span> Submit a request to SANOPS for an offline refund due to funds not received. Include bank provided documentation via DTM and the reason why an exception to the process should be considered. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span> Once SANOPS confirms approval to proceed, let the customer know to expect a link to MPC. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span> Make sure that offline refunds are never be promised in advance of AP approval. This is especially important for .Fraud customers given the complexity. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span> Once SAFE Approval is complete and you&#39;ve received notice that the refund has been approved, follow <strong>standard SLA guidance</strong> to set appropriate customer expectations around SLA.</span></span></span></li>
