<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="1." name="1.">1. </a>Overview</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Customers with out of warranty (OOW) Surface devices needing technical support of any kind is subject to an OOW paid incident fee called <strong>Premium Support Surface</strong>. The fee must be collected before troubleshooting the customer&rsquo;s issue. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If device servicing/exchange is determined necessary through troubleshooting, you are to refund the customer the OOW paid incident fee and charge the OOW repair/exchange fee should the customer choose to proceed. </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Customers with an active </span></span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=862447" managed-link="" target="_blank">Assure Software Support plan</a></span></span></span><span><span><span> are entitled to receive free troubleshooting support. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Customers with Assure are not exempt from paying the standard device servicing/exchange OOW fee in cases where a device exchange is necessary.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-AU"><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-AU"><span><span> For Australia warranty support, consumers have the right to repair, replace, or refund in certain situations. </span></span></span>See KB&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4100081" target="_blank">4100081 Guideline: Microsoft and the Australian and New Zealand Consumer Law</a><span lang="EN-AU"></span><span lang="EN-AU"><span><span> for more information. Where a consumer has that right, you must follow the ACL policy and you must not charge or collect the incident fee.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><a name="2.">2. </a>General call flow</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>As the contact begins, you must quickly verify the customer&rsquo;s issue and verify the state of the customer&rsquo;s entitlement to receive support. </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>When you determine a device is OOW, the customer must pay the Surface OOW Diagnostic fee before troubleshooting can begin. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the customer device needs to be serviced/exchanged to resolve the issue, you will refund the OOW incident fee in lieu of the device servicing fee being charged. If the issue can be resolved through troubleshooting and does not require device servicing, the customer will be charged the OOW incident fee for the services rendered. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>You are expected to build rapport with the customer to diagnose the customer&rsquo;s needs and determine the best option for the customer (either the OOW Paid Incident or resources for self-help if the issue would not require servicing/exchange). </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If OOW servicing options are not available/offered for the customer&rsquo;s device type, the Surface OOW Diagnostic fee should be refunded post troubleshooting If it is determined that their device requires servicing to resolve their issue. See KB&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3164686" target="_blank">3164686 Procedure: Surface: Refunding Out Of Warranty (OOW) paid support incident&nbsp;</a>and check the refund status for complete details.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Messaging</strong><em><strong>:</strong> &ldquo;Your Surface device is currently outside the warranty period. I can help you troubleshoot your issue for &lt;insert price&gt;. If troubleshooting determines your device needs servicing, I will refund this fee in lieu of the repair/exchange fee, so you will not be charged twice. Would you like to proceed?&rdquo; </em></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Remember, before subjecting the customer to these fees identify what the issue falls under. If the scenario is an OOW exempt scenario, the customer would not have to pay for OOW support. Alternatively, do not allude the customer to expect that they will receive free troubleshooting if their device does not fall into the OOW exempt coverage. <span><span><span>Check <span><a bookmark-id="4.2" href="#4.2" managed-link="">section 4.2</a> </span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span>OOW Exempt Scenarios for more details</span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.<br>
<br>
Not all countries have Surface paid support options available. Check <a bookmark-id="3.1" href="#3.1" managed-link=""><span>section 3.1</span></a></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span> <span><span><span>for more details about global pricing and countries in scope.<br>

<h3><span><span><span><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Entitlement and offers available </span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>When the customer is OOW, what you can offer the customer is the Surface OOW Diagnostic offer. The customer needs to purchase this service before you start OOW troubleshooting. While the customer having Assure on their account provides entitlement to free support, Assure <em>cannot </em>be sold by a Surface advocate as an offer. To avail of Assure, the customer must have Assure on their account <em>prior</em> to reaching Surface support for assistance.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Some customer situations are OOW exempt, meaning they will not have to pay for troubleshooting support even while their device is OOW. However, this does not exempt the customer from paying the device servicing/exchange fee to have their device exchanged. See <a bookmark-id="4.2" href="#4.2" managed-link="">section <span>4.2 </span></a></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><span><span><span>for complete details.</span></span></span></span></p>
