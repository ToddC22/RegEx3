<h4 class="sbody-h3"><a class="bookmark" id="1"></a><a class="bookmark" id="1.1"></a><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a>1.2&nbsp;Why did this happen?</h4>

<p>When we see someone sign in to a customer&rsquo;s Microsoft account from an unfamiliar location, it can be a symptom of someone trying to break into their account. To help keep their account safe, we put a block on the account that requires an additional security check for any sign-in from that location.</p>
<a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="" target="">Return&nbsp;to top</a>

<h4 class="sbody-h4"><a class="bookmark" id="1.2"></a><a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a>1.3 How do I fix this?</h4>
If the customer is travelling or attempting to sign in from a location they don&rsquo;t normally sign in from, they will be asked to use a security code to confirm that the person signing in from that location is really the account owner.&nbsp;See&nbsp;<a bookmark-id="3.1" href="#3.1" managed-link="" target="">Section 3.1</a>.<br>
<br>
If the customer received this message but did not sign in from a new location or device, this may be a sign of an attempt to break into their account and the customer should take steps to rule that out or protect their account. See <a bookmark-id="3.2" href="#3.2" managed-link="" target="">Section 3.2</a>.<br>

<h3 class="sbody-h3"><a class="bookmark" id="3"></a>3. Things To Try</h3>

<h4 class="sbody-h3"><a id="3.1" name="3.1"></a>3.1<span>&nbsp;</span>If the customer signed in from a different location than they usually do</h4>

<p class="sbody-h3">Ask if the customer has signed in using a device they haven&rsquo;t used before or if they have signed in from a new location, such as a friend&rsquo;s house, a library, or maybe their workplace.<br>
<br>
If the customer has signed in from someplace new, they will need to clear the unusual activity state. To do so, the customer will be prompted to use a code sent to one of their pieces of security info. If the customer is having difficulty because they don&#39;t have access to their security info, you can do the following<span>:</span></p>

<ol class="sbody-num_list">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Ask if the customer has access to a tablet or laptop that they normally sign-in with. If they do, try signing in with that device from that location. If that device was set to be a &quot;trusted device&quot; they should bypass the interrupt. </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-is-trusted-device" managed-link="" target="_blank">Read more about Trusted Devices</a>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li>If customer left their alternative contact phone at home, see if a family member or friend with access to the phone can relay the security code sent to that phone.</li>
	<li>If there is no way to access security info, the customer will regain access once they return to their usual location and sign in or, if absolutely necessary, they can use the &ldquo;Recover your Microsoft account&rdquo; form to get back in.&nbsp;&nbsp;(See KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3123259" managed-link="" target="_blank">3123259 Procedure: Microsoft account: The &quot;Recover your Microsoft account&quot; form</a>&nbsp;for recovery form instructions).</li>
</ol>

<h4 class="sbody-h4"><a class="bookmark" id="3.2"></a>3.2 If the customer did not sign in from a different location</h4>
Have the customer select&nbsp;<strong>Review recent activity</strong> in the email that was sent. This will show a log of recent sign in locations.

<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li>Have the customer check to make sure they don&rsquo;t know why a sign in from that location would occur</li>
	<li>Ask if the customer got a new phone from a different provider or if any new apps were installed that might try to sign in as the customer
	<div class="indent">a. Some apps that sign in on behalf of the customer include email apps and social media apps tied to a Microsoft account.</div>

	<div class="indent">b. Apps that sign in on behalf of the customer will need to ask for permissions to do so when they are installed and will prompt the customer for their Microsoft account and password, so ask if the customer remembers having to enter their password when they set up any Windows Phone or Windows apps.</div>
	</li>
	<li>If the customer does not know why a sign in would occur from a different location, strongly suggest that the customer reset their password and check for unusual activity on any other accounts that they might have.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;If the customer indicates that they suspect their account was compromised, advise them of the following:
