<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="1." name="1.">1. </a>Overview</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span>Microsoft is committed to the highest standards of business ethics, including fair competition and compliance with antitrust laws. Employees, partners, customers or others outside the company who have concerns about compliance or Microsoft business practices can report their concerns to the <strong>Office of Legal Compliance (OLC)</strong>.</span></span></p>

<h3>2. Procedures</h3>

<h4><a id="2.1" name="2.1">2.1</a> Identifying the customer&rsquo;s concern</h4>

<p><span>The <strong>OLC</strong> handles concerns around Microsoft&rsquo;s business conduct and compliance with antitrust laws. The <strong>OLC</strong> is meant for reporting up allegations of:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Breaches of standards of business conduct.</span></li>
	<li><span>Bribery.</span></li>
	<li><span>Conflicts of interest.</span></li>
	<li><span>Anticompetitive activities.</span></li>
	<li><span>Integrity risks.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>The <strong>OLC</strong> does <strong>NOT</strong> handle:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Mediation of unresolved support issues such as billing concerns including refunds, technical issues or warranty concerns around device failures. </span></li>
	<li><span>Customer complaints</span></li>
	<li><span>Commercial issue complaints</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>To ensure the customer&rsquo;s concerns are addressed effectively, it is important to clearly understand the customer&rsquo;s core concerns. You must only refer customers to the <strong>OLC</strong> for matters they handle.</span></p>
