<p><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><span><span><span>The Microsoft gambling advertising policy differs by country and region. As an advertiser, it is your responsibility to ensure compliance with all applicable local and national regulations. Microsoft reserves the right to refuse an ad or to make exceptions to the policy even if an ad complies with the policies.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Ads and keywords that are acceptable under one country&rsquo;s policies might not be acceptable under another. If you advertise in two or more countries, you will need to make any changes necessary to comply with all the policies.</span></span></span></p>

<p><a id="PermittedMarkets" name="PermittedMarkets"></a><span><span><span>In certain markets, Microsoft allows advertising for websites that promote or facilitate online gambling, accept wagers, or require payment in exchange for the chance to win prizes provided that advertisers comply with the following restrictions.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Online gambling advertisers must comply with all applicable legislation. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The gambling operator must comply with licensing or registration requirements in each market where their content is serving. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Sites must not accept or procure bets from residents of countries where online gambling is disallowed, such as the U.S or India for example. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Advertisers purchasing gambling-related keywords and advertising aggregated content for third-party gambling services (providing links to the websites) must agree to ensure that their partners comply with the policy set out above.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<strong>Responsible Gaming Messaging</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Advertising must not misrepresent or glorify the benefits of gambling, or encourage people to play beyond their means. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Advertising may not imply or suggest that gambling is a viable alternative to employment or financial investments, a way to recover from financial losses or that skills may affect the outcome of a game of chances. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Information on the odds of winning and prize amounts must be described accurately and must not be misrepresented. Advertisers may not present winning as the most probable outcome of the game, nor misrepresent a person&rsquo;s chance of winning a prize. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Targeting minors is not allowed. Advertising must not be directed toward individuals under the applicable minimum age to participate in online gambling, or served in a context where it is highly likely it will be displayed to such individuals. This includes, but it is not limited to, the use of language, themes, expressions, graphic resources, audio or visual elements that may appeal to underage individuals, or using individuals who are or appear to be underage in promotional content or on the website.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> If it comes to our attention that a site is soliciting users to participate in online gambling (including, without limitation, through email correspondence with users), we will terminate that site&rsquo;s listing.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>

Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>How are sweepstakes, contests, competitions, and skill games different from gambling?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>In all cases, if an entry fee or some other form of significant consideration is required in order to enter, then there is a potential for online gambling and the advertisement be would not be allowed. Further detail is listed below:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Gambling:</span></span></strong><span><span> As a basic principle, what defines online gambling is the requirement to pay money or provide &lsquo;consideration&rsquo; to participate, and where winning prizes or money relies on &lsquo;chance&rsquo;. If those two elements are present together, then it is most likely gambling. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Sweepstakes:</span></span></strong><span><span> Winners are chosen randomly and therefore sweepstakes are considered games of chance. Sweepstakes don&rsquo;t typically require a user to pay or offer consideration and therefore are generally not considered gambling. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Contests, competitions and skill games:</span></span></strong><span><span> These typically require a level of skill, knowledge or expertise in order to win, thus removing the element of chance. However, the Microsoft Advertising does not allow advertising for these types of sites due to risk for gambling.</span></span></span></span></li>

Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What is the difference between a skill game and a game of chance?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>A game of chance is a game where the outcome is random, and one player has no particular advantage over another. The outcome of a game of skill is influenced by the player&rsquo;s acumen &ndash; for example if that player had particular knowledge that influences his/her chances of winning. This may be ability, knowledge, or other influence unique to the player.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Examples:</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Slot game - no player had a unique advantage over another, the bonus or jackpot may trigger at any time for any player. The outcome is based on luck &ndash; this is <strong>a game of chance</strong>. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Crossword competition &ndash; chances of winning rely on one player&rsquo;s knowledge of language and therefore the chances of winning are based on the unique skill of the player &ndash; this is <strong>a game of skill</strong>.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q4"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Are all educational, &ldquo;learn to play,&rdquo; &ldquo;practice&rdquo; and other free simulation sites disallowed?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>No. They are only disallowed if they are affiliated with an online gambling site.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q5"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What about games with a monthly subscription fee and the possibility of winning a prize? Does that count as consideration?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Yes, a membership fee counts as consideration. If prizes can be won, then this could potentially be online gambling and we should disallow. In cases where you are unsure whether the advertiser is requesting &lsquo;consideration&rsquo; in exchange for participation, please escalate to L3.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q6"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Are ads allowed for physical gambling establishments?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Yes. Advertising is allowed for brick-and-mortar establishments that offer legal gambling (in geographic regions where gambling is legal), provided that the site to which the destination URL points is in no way affiliated with online gambling or wagering.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For example, a casino can advertise legal gambling services if its customers can access the gambling offerings only in a legal manner, such as traveling to the location in order to participate. A casino resort can advertise any non-gambling-related businesses, such as hotel accommodations.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q7"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Are ads allowed for gambling-related merchandise?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Yes. Advertising for items such as poker chips, playing cards, card tables, hand-held games, books, CDs, and DVDs are allowed, provided that the website to which the destination URL points is in no way affiliated with online gambling or wagering.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q8"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Are ads allowed for gambling-related events or activities?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Yes. Advertising for gambling-related activities is allowed, provided that they are in no way connected to an opportunity to gamble online. For example, an advertiser can promote a televised poker game as entertainment, but not how to participate.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q9"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What are some examples of qualifying ad text?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>The ad text &quot;Enter for a chance to win a free computer&quot; is correct because it indicates that the consumer must enter a contest in order to win the prize.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The ad text &quot;You have just won a free computer&quot;</span></span></span><del cite="mailto:Ioana%20Albu%20(Allyis%20Inc)">&rdquo;</del> is incorrect because it does not indicate that conditions apply in order to win the computer.<span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q10"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What are examples of consideration that would not be allowed for a sweepstakes or other game of chance?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Here are some examples:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Payment of a fee that is not associated with another service. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Non-monetary requirements that would require significant effort on behalf of the user, such as provision of multiple contact details, or a task that may take a significant amount of time to complete.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: If users only need to offer their name and details to sign up and participate, this does not amount to consideration.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q11"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>How do we determine acceptable gambling sites in the UK and IE?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Gambling advertisers must be registered with the UK gambling commission. The advertiser&#39;s site must include:</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>A disclaimer of the gambling commission with a clickable link to their information page on the gambling commission registry. The information is generally provided at the bottom of the landing page. </span></span></p>

Q: </span></span><span><span>Who is allowed to advertise gambling and lotteries in the Canadian (CA) market?</span></span><br>
<br>

<strong>Q: </strong></span><strong>What are fantasy sports?</strong></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Fantasy sports are games where participants create virtual teams composed of real-world players to compete in a fantasy league.

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Unlike fantasy sports, sports betting involves wagering and winnings based upon the performance of a team or individual athletes in a real-world event. For example, selecting the Seattle Seahawks winning over the Green Bay Packers on a 7-point spread, or Manny Pacquiao defeating Floyd Mayweather in an upcoming boxing bout. Sports betting ads are disallowed in the US market.</span></span></span><br>
