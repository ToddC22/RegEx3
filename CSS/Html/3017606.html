<h3><strong><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>This TSG outlines the process of how to<span> </span>submit a Privacy Incident if a data privacy breach occurs, and how to assist customers who have concerns about Personally Identifiable Information (PII) or data retention.<br>
<br>
<strong>Applies To: </strong>From a Data Privacy perspective, the Microsoft Azure Subscription Management Support team handles customers&#39; Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in every single support case we receive from customers. As such, it is imperative that we always follow the strictest standards of data protection.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</strong></h3>

<h4><strong><a id="When to Submit a Privacy Incident" name="When to Submit a Privacy Incident"></a>When to Submit a Privacy Incident</strong></h4>

<p>Any time customer PII is exposed to Microsoft or exposed because of Microsoft&rsquo;s actions, immediately submit a Privacy Incident. Examples of privacy incidents which apply to Azure Subscription Management Support include (but are not limited to):</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>Customer emails us their full credit card number, even if <span asset="4497459" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4497459]</span> CaseMail is not included in the recipient list.</span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customer includes their full credit card number in their initial Case submission.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customer provides the first four (4) and last four (4) digits of their credit card at any point in the case. Exposure of <em>any</em> card details other than the last four (4) digits qualifies for a privacy incident.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customer emails us their username/password for their Azure account, Virtual Machines (<span>VM</span>s), etc.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customer sends us their Social Security Number, passport, bank statements, or equivalent.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customer requests that their PII be removed from all Azure-related databases/records.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customer complains about ASMS/Microsoft use of their personal data (<em>any</em> customer, not just EA/Premier).</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASMS Support Engineer (SE) includes the wrong customer&#39;s email address as a recipient on an email to another customer.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASMS performs a data migration from one customer&#39;s account to the wrong destination account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASMS SE adds a customer to an incorrect tenant, inadvertently granting access to an unauthorized individual.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASMS SE adds a customer as an administrator to the wrong customer&#39;s account or subscription.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASMS SE provides customer PII to another Microsoft employee who is not part of CTS/GBS (e.g., a TAM) without the consent of the customer.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASMS SE&#39;s credentials are used by someone other than that ASMS engineer to access customer data or to contact a customer.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASMS SE receives a Privacy inquiry from the media or a Regulatory Agency.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASMS SE stores customer data on OneDrive for Consumer (onedrive.live.com) instead of OneDrive for Business. Only OneDrive for Business is approved for storing customer data.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span>ASMS SE provides PII (such as email address) of one customer to another customer</span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Example:</strong> Customer A states they are supposed to have access to a VM running in a subscription. Customer A is not the Account Administrator (<span>AA), Service Administrator (SA), or Co-Administrator (CA</span>). Customer A does not have the contact information of the AA, SA, or CA and asks ASMS to give the AA/SA/CA email address to Customer A so that Customer A can contact the AA/SA/CA. ASMS must not give the contact information of the AA/SA/CA to Customer A.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>ASMS SE mistakenly shares the subscription GUID of one internal customer with a different internal customer while working on a case.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a difference between a &ldquo;Privacy&rdquo; issue and a &ldquo;Security&rdquo; issue. If a customer contacts support because their Azure deployments have been &ldquo;hacked&rdquo; or their deployments are hit by malware or a virus, that is a Security issue as opposed to a Privacy issue and you do <em>not</em> need to open a Privacy Incident.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary Note:</strong> Only the customer should provide the last four&nbsp;digits of a credit card for confirmation. You should not give out the last four digits of a credit card to anyone, even the <span>cardholder</span>. Giving out the last four&nbsp;digits of the credit card number, even to the credit card owner, could pose a security risk, in addition to triggering a privacy incident.</p>

<p><strong>Third Note:&nbsp;</strong>When ASMS request for Proof of Payment from customer&rsquo;s we need to ensure that we educate the customer to mask/hide their personal Bank Account details. If we receive the proof of payment which reflects the customer&rsquo;s bank account details, then we need to submit the privacy incident for the same.</p>

</ol>

<h4><strong><a id="Purging MSSolve cases" name="Purging MSSolve cases"></a>Purging <span asset="4497459" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4497459]</span> cases</strong></h4>

<p>A Privacy Issue may arise where the customer includes their PII in the <span asset="4497459" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4497459]</span>case submission to such a degree that IPG requires the <span asset="4497459" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4497459]</span> case to be &#39;purged&#39;. Once the case is purged, it is no longer available or viewable in <span asset="4497459" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4497459]</span>, alleviating part of the Privacy issue.</p>

<p>When IPG notifies you that they will be submitting the <span asset="4497459" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4497459]</span>case to be purged, <em>do not close the case</em>. Allow the case to remain in an open state for the purging process to begin.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure to document in your case notes that a privacy incident occured. This will help others who may later review the case understand why information is missing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><a id="Turn off Outlook's Auto-Complete feature" name="Turn off Outlook's Auto-Complete feature"></a>Turn off Outlook&#39;s Auto-Complete feature</strong></h4>

<p>All ASMS engineers should disable the <strong>Auto-Complete Recipient Name</strong> list feature in Outlook. With this feature enabled, it is very easy to send an email to the wrong customer or recipient, greatly increasing the risk for a PII breach and resulting Privacy Incident.<br>
<br>
<strong>Example:</strong> While sending an email to Customer A that email contains PII of Customer A, the engineer tries to add CaseMail as a recipient so the email gets copied into the case notes. However, the Outlook auto-complete feature interferes and adds Customer B (whose name starts with the letters C-A-S) instead of CaseMail, and the engineer doesn&#39;t notice the error before sending the email. Customer B then receives the email containing Customer A&#39;s PII, and Microsoft has caused a Privacy Incident.<br>
<br>
Always turn this feature <strong>off</strong>, and manually type in each email recipient address to ensure privacy and accuracy!<br>

<h4><strong><a id="Customer Requests to Close Their Account and Delete Their Data" name="Customer Requests to Close Their Account and Delete Their Data"></a>Customer Requests to Close Their Account and Delete Their Data</strong></h4>

<p>Customers may ask ASMS to &quot;close my Azure account&quot; and/or &quot;delete all my data and PII&quot; associated to it. While Microsoft does not have the ability to &#39;close&#39; an OMS account, we can fulfil the customer&#39;s request as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Have the customer cancel every one of their Azure subscriptions and pay all outstanding bills.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Once the Subscriptions are cancelled, engage your TA to have the subscriptions deprovisioned.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Help the customer remove their credit card from the account (if present).</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Engage PayOps to have them remove all the customer&#39;s PII from the account so that none of the customer&#39;s PII is viewable in CMAT. (Point PayOps to TFS#1414481 as an example of how they helped with this in the past).</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When you create the request, use the language &ldquo;Remove information/anonymize account.&rdquo; If you ask PayOps to delete or close the account, PayOps will treat the issue as close account case, which we do not support for OMS accounts, and will reject the request.</p>

<ol start="5">
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the customer is asking that their PII be removed from all Microsoft entities and not just from Azure:</span></span></span></span>

	<ol>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Send mail to <strong>lcaprivinform </strong>and ask for their assistance removing the PII</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Point the customer to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12412/microsoft-account-how-to-close-account">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12412/microsoft-account-how-to-close-account</a> to close their Microsoft Account.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Step 5 only works for Microsoft Personal Accounts. Microsoft Work or School Accounts (formerly OrgIDs) are controlled by the global administrator of their tenant. Customers must contact that person to cancel their account and remove all data.</p>
