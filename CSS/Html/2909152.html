<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><span><span><span>Azure DevOps (formerly Visual Studio Team Services) allows customers to plan projects, collaborate, and manage code online from anywhere. Azure DevOps exists as a free standalone service, which does not require an Azure subscription for free usage and has its own portal. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This TSG provides guidance on how to assist customers who may contact ASMS with questions about this offer. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Azure DevOps Organizations are available for free to all customers at </span></span></span><a href="http://start.visualstudio.com/"><span><span>http://start.visualstudio.com/</span></span></a><span><span><span> and includes the following:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Unlimited private projects </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>5 Repos and Boards (Basic) users</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>

	<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/billing/buy-basic-access-add-users?view=vsts&amp;tabs=new-nav">Unlimited Visual Studio (VS) Subscribers</a></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Unlimited Stakeholders </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Monthly amount of Build and Deployment Hosted Agent (e.g., 1800 minutes/month) </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Monthly amount of Cloud-based Load Testing (e.g., 20,000 virtual user minutes/month) </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Azure DevOps Organizations that stay within these constraints will not require an Azure subscription for billing. However, Azure DevOps Organizations that need to go beyond these free limits will need to be linked to an Azure subscription. For more information, see </span></span></span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/billing/set-up-billing-for-your-organization-vs?view=vsts"><span><span>Set up billing for your Azure DevOps organization</span></span></a><span><span><span>. For Azure DevOps pricing details, see <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/">Pricing for Azure DevOps</a>.</span></span></span></p>

<h3>Policy</h3>

<h4><strong><span><span><span>Support Boundaries</span></span></span></strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The ASMS team supports billing dispute questions. Other Azure DevOps questions should go to that specific support team. See the Engagement and Escalation Path section of this TSG to determine the appropriate support team. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Azure DevOps is available under Azure support contracts and customers with paid Azure technical support can submit a SR via Azure portal in their preferred language.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Azure DevOps has its own SLA and support availability, so the standard Azure SLA for tickets and availability does not apply to the Azure DevOps team. For more information, please see </span></span><span><span><a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/support/support-overview-vs.aspx">http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/support/support-overview-vs.aspx</a></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3>Customer Experience and Provisioning</h3>

<p>Use the table below to see what experiences the customer may encounter via self-serve.</p>

<table class="table">

			<td width="330">
			<p><span><span><span>Customers can self-serve this scenario from the Management Portal. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>The <strong>Remove billing</strong> action will result in the removal of the resource from the subscription and the Azure DevOps organization will downgrade to a free state. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> For more information see </span></span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/billing/change-azure-subscription?view=vsts#remove-billing-subscription"><span><span>Removing a billing subscription</span></span></a><span><span>. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Customers may have an issue where all available paid Azure DevOps users have been added to the Azure DevOps account, but the Admin wants to remove a user and add another user into the account without purchasing more Azure DevOps users. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>The owner of the Azure DevOps account or a member of the Project Collection Admins group can complete this action by doing the following: </span></span></span></p>

			<ol>
				<li>
				<p><span><span><span>Navigate to <strong>&lt;acct&gt;.visualstudio.com/_user</strong></span></span></span></p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p><span><span><span>Remove one user and assign it to another user.</span></span></span></p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p><span><span><span>If the customer has attempted these steps and needs additional help, send a Problem to the <strong>Developer VSTS Depth</strong> queue. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Select <strong>Azure DevOps</strong> as the routing product to engage VSTS Developer Depth queue.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>In these instances, the Azure Account Admin (AA) will need to add the Azure DevOps Account Owner as an Azure subscription owner, contributor, service admin, or co-admin. </span></span></span></p>

<h3>Support Scenarios</h3>

<p>Below is a list of scenarios in which the customer will contact support. Use this table to determine how to best assist the customer.</p>

			<td width="330">
			<p><span><span><span>In these scenarios do the following:</span></span></span></p>

			<ol>
				<li>
				<p><span><span><span>Inform the customer that the Azure DevOps account will be downgraded to a free state upon canceling. </span></span></span></p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p><span><span><span>Once confirmed follow the standard Azure Cancellation workflow. </span></span></span></p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> A Subscription C</span></span>ancelation<span><span> will result in a downgrade of the Azure DevOps account to a free state. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>For more information, please see </span></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646764"><span><span>TSG 2646764</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>When an Azure subscription becomes disabled, Azure DevOps users may lose access as well. The Owner reactivates the Azure subscription, but when the Azure DevOps user goes back to Azure DevOps users Hub, the user still sees the user status is disabled. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>This status is due to a system delay, in which the customer would need to wait until the re-enablement changes fully propagate through the system. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Changes go through multiple hubs (CP to Azure RDFE to VSTS Metering Service to VSTS Account Services) before a user can see the impact of changes. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>If more than one hour has elapsed and the issues persists, ASMS should follow the regular A</span></span>SE<span><span> engagement process for sync issues that lead to a wrong subscription state. </span></span></span></p>

<h3>Engagement and Escalation Path</h3>

<h4><strong><span><span><span>Engaging the VSTS Depth queue</span></span></span></strong></h4>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>To engage the VSTS Depth queue in <span>MSSolve</span> use the <strong><span>Developer VSTS </span></strong>queue (Problem). SLA is 1 business day, so if the Azure DevOps customer wants faster service, they can open a new case for Azure DevOps support and pay for faster service: </span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>Go to </span></span></span><a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/support-overview-vs"><span><span>http://www.visualstudio.com/support-overview-vs </span></span></a></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>Click the <strong>Azure DevOps (formerly VSTS)</strong> link. </span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>Scroll to and click <strong>Create an incident</strong> under <strong>Premium technical support</strong>.</span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>Do not transfer cases to <strong><span>Developer VSTS</span></strong> for issues not handled by ASMS. Customers should open new support cases using Premier Online, or the process above. </span></span></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong><span><span><span>Engaging Azure DevOps</span></span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span><span>You may need to engage Azure DevOps for some scenarios such as billing disputes or verifying customer usage claims but first you must gain access to Azure DevOps: </span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span>Go to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://myaccess" managed-link="" target="_blank">//MyAccess</a> to request both READ and WRITE access to the required Azure DevOps by searching for <strong><span>DevDiv Work Items </span></strong>and request access. </span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span>Once access is approved, use this link: <a href="https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/VSOnline/_workItems" target="_blank">https://mseng.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection/VSOnline/_workItems</a>.</span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This server requires 2-factor authentication. You will be required to sign in with a physical or virtual smart card, or your phone&hellip; even when connected to CorpNet. For more information, see <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/itweb/securelogon" target="_blank">https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/itweb/securelogon</a>.</p>

	<p><span><span><span><span>Save the work item:</span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>When you are ready to send it to the Azure DevOps Commerce team, save it once to trigger an email to that team and send it to their triage, then change the [STATE] field to <strong>2&nbsp;- CSS&nbsp;Triage</strong> and save again.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> No action will be taken on the request until this is done, as the work item must be moved to <strong>2</strong><strong>&nbsp;- CSS&nbsp;Triage</strong> or it will remain invisible to&nbsp;Azure DevOps Support.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Azure DevOps Commerce team will comment the work item in the History section and\or email you. They will then assign the work item back to you with questions or a resolution. You should check on the work item periodically to see if it has been updated. You may also want to copy a link to the work item for future reference after submitting it.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>You can also select the <strong>follow</strong> button in the TSF ticket to be emailed each time the ticket is updated by anyone.</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ol start="6">
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span>If the work item is sent back with questions, answer them in the <strong><span>HISTORY </span></strong>section then assign the work item back to the person who assigned it to you. For added visibility, you may wish to send them a courtesy email as well telling them you&rsquo;ve done this. You can see who assigned you the work item on HISTORY.</span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Set these fields when sending it back:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>STATE: <strong>5 - PG Engaged</strong></span></p>

	<li>
	<p><span>Assigned To: &lt;The person who assigned it to you&gt;</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Once the issue is resolved Azure DevOps Commerce team will assign the work item back to the SE who opened it.</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ol start="7">
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span><span>It is your responsibility to close the work item when it is resolved by setting the STATE field to <strong><span>6 - Closed</span></strong>. This is mandatory.</span></span></span></span></p>
