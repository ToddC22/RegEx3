<h3><a id="3" name="3"><span>3. Partner Dashboard (Partner Center) User Experience</span></a></h3>

<p><span>Partners can access the Go-to Market offers page from their dashboard by selecting from the left-hand <strong>MPN </strong>menu the <strong>Benefits </strong>tab<strong> </strong>and then the <strong>Go-to-Market </strong>option as seen in screenshot below:</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Any user will be able to assign the benefits to a user in his organization. </span></li>
	<li><strong><span>Ideally, the user that is assigned with the benefits should hold a marketing position in the Partner&rsquo;s Company.</span></strong></li>
</ul>

</div>
</div>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>After assigning the benefit to a user within the Organization, a Partner has the option to redeem his offer by clicking on the <strong>Activate &ldquo;Click here&rdquo; </strong> button or &ldquo;show description&rdquo; to learn more. </span></span></span></span></span> </span></p>

<p><span asset="4566376" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4566376]</span></p>

<p><span>Once a GTM benefit is successfully redeemed, the status in-line with the activated benefit will change from <strong>Available</strong> to <strong>Active</strong>. </span></p>

<p><span asset="4566377" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4566377]</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Following the redemption of the benefit, Partner will also receive an activation e-mail from Partner Dashboard (Partner Center) containing the next steps and within two business days, only for Silver and/ ISV Partners with a co-sell ready solution and Gold Partners and/or ISV partners with an IP co-sell ready solution, a delegated person from the Go-To-Market with Microsoft desk team will initiate contact with Partner (via email) to start the execution of the offers redeemed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If a different user needs to be assigned with the marketing role within the Organization, this can be changed. If the previous user was already working with the GTM Resource desk team, the new user will continue as soon as he is assigned with the benefits.</span></span></span></span></span> </span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="n4" name="n4"></a>4. Partner fulfillment in Solution Workspace</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For Silver and/ ISV Partners with a co-sell ready solution and Gold Partners and/or ISV partners with an IP co-sell ready solution, the partner will fulfill and track their GTM offers in Solution Workspace. This is where partners can start their offer, track its progress, and perform partner activities needed to complete the offer service.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The steps below will cover the actions taken by a partner in Solution Workspace when working on their offer or reward. Although we encourage partners to use Solution Workspace as a self-serve tool and lessen their reliance on engagement managers, it is important for engagement managers to understand the steps which partners will take when working on their offers and rewards in Solution Workspace to help guide and assist when necessary. Engagement managers WILL NOT work in Solution Workspace but continue to accomplish their daily tasks in OCP GTM.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<strong><span><span><span>Accessing go-to-market offers and <span>rewards</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span asset="4593533" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4593533]</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Partners with a Microsoft competency, ISV partners with a co-sell ready solution, ISV Connect partners, and partners with a published solution in the Microsoft commercial marketplace will have access to start working on Go-To-Market Offers and Marketplace Rewards. To access their go-to-market offers and rewards, they can go to the</span></span></span> <span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://preview.partner.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/my-solutions" managed-link="" target="_blank">My Solutions landing page</a> </span></span></span><span><span><span>and sign in. Here, they will find their solutions and applicable go-to-market offers and rewards. If they have more than four Go-To-Market Offers or Marketplace Rewards, they can view them by selecting the View all option to go to a gallery.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Their offers and rewards will be listed in the gallery in the following order:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>In progress:</span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Action required</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Most recent</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Available</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Completed</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Expired</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>They can search for offers or rewards in a few ways. Use the Filter option on the left side to search by the status of offers or rewards. Use the search bar to enter key terms to look for a particular offer or reward by either title or name. They can also use the Sort by drop-down list on the right side to arrange the offers and rewards by either status or latest.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>When they find the offer or reward that they&rsquo;re looking for, select it to view the details of that <span>page</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span asset="4593534" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4593534]</span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Learning about available offers and rewards</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Go-To-Market Offers and Marketplace Rewards that appear on the page are those that are available to their company. To learn more details of an offer or reward and the value that it can bring to their solution or company, select its card.<br>
Selecting the card will take they to a page with the details of the Go-To-Market Offer or Marketplace Reward. They can learn about the main benefits of using this offer or reward on the Details tab. Some offers and rewards have an example of what they would receive if they were to enact it. If an offer or reward has this example, a thumbnail of it will appear. To view a full example, select the Download example option to download an example that they can open and review.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Starting their go-to-market offers and <span>rewards</span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span asset="4593535" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4593535]</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>When they select a card, whether to learn more about the offer or reward or to start acting on it, they will land on its Details page. If they&rsquo;re ready to start acting on their offer or reward, select the Start now button, after which they will land on the Workflow section of the page.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Here, they will find a progress bar, Get started instructions, a Work area section, and a Latest activity section. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The progress bar will show they, at a glance, where their offer or reward is in the process. As they move through the steps to act on the offer or reward, their position on the progress bar will also move.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Get started section can have templates or helpful resources to provide a guide for their information or give they more context about what they have to provide. This section will always provide the steps for they to progress through the offer or reward.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In the Work area section, they can complete fields, upload files, or add a comment to their Partner Engagement Manager or Marketplace Rewards Engagement Manager. The fields can change, based on their current stage. Comments that they enter in the Comment section will go to their Engagement Manager. Upon submission, upload fields will change to read-only. They will always be able to enter <span>comments.</span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<div>
<div><span asset="4593548" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4593548]</span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<p><span><span><span><span><span>After they complete an activity in the Work area section, it will appear in the Latest activity section of the page. When they&rsquo;re first starting, they will see the text &ldquo;No activity yet&rdquo; in this section. They will also find comments from their Engagement Manager in the Latest activity section.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Keeping track of their progress with go-to-market offers and rewards</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>They can track their progress through Go-To-Market Offers and Marketplace Rewards in several ways in Solution Workspace. The first way is the colored status found on the card itself. They can find this indicator on the card, either on the </span></span></span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://preview.partner.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/my-solutions" managed-link="" target="_blank">My Solutions landing page</a></span></span><span><span><span> or in the gallery. It has a few states:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>In progress</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Available</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Completed</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Expired </span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span asset="4593549" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4593549]</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>When an offer or reward is in progress, the step that the offer or reward is in will appear under the status itself. This step is identical to the status on the progress bar that appears in the Workflow section. Also, if they&rsquo;re interested in the details about the progress of an individual offer or reward, go to the page by selecting the card and going to the Workflow section. Here, they will find the progress bar and the Latest activity section.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If they have questions, they can use the Comment section or send a message to the email address that is listed on each offer or <span>reward</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span asset="4593550" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4593550]</span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Adding contacts to their offers and rewards</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Any individual at their company can view, start, or take action on a Go-To-Market Offer or Marketplace Reward. However, they might want to call attention to one or more offers or rewards to specific individuals at their company. If they want a particular person to view a Go-To-Market Offer or Marketplace Reward, they can invite them.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To invite a teammate, go to the Contacts section of the offer or reward, enter their email address, and select the +Invite button. This action will open a dialog box to confirm that they want to add their teammate. After they select the Add and send invite option, their default email application will open with a prepopulated email. After they send the email, and the recipient has accepted the invitation by selecting the access link within it, their teammate will appear in the Contacts table.</span></span></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Adding a teammate will list them as a contact in the Contacts section, or, if that person is an individual outside their company, it will give them access to the Go-To-Market Offer or Marketplace Reward within Solution Workspace. Contacts who are added here are granted permission only to that Go-To-Market Offer or Marketplace Reward.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

When will they get the asset?</span></div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: Partners will be contacted by their Partner Engagement Manager within 3 business days of submitting a request for a co-branded asset. The PEM will work with the partner to finalize the asset. If it has been more than 3 business days, please follow the steps in <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4471278" managed-link="" target="_blank">this document</a>.</p>

What does that mean?</span></div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: Admin consent means that the IT admin at the partners company needs to allow the Ansira Partner Go-To-Market Toolbox to access their AAD tenant. Without admin consent, some partners will not be able to access the Toolbox. This is the partner&rsquo;s internal policy setting decided on by the partner&rsquo;s IT department and cannot be changed by Microsoft.</p>

Is this safe to do?</span></div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: This is safe for the partner to do. This Microsoft application is built using another company&rsquo;s software so we have to ask for each user&rsquo;s permission to access name, email and partner information to provide the best user experience.</p>

Why don&rsquo;t they have access?</span></div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: The Toolbox queries Partner Center to validate partner status. If no partner status is returned, or the partner status returns as inactive, the user will not be granted access. Please ensure that partner status is active and the partner is in good standing. If the partner membership is up to date and the partner should have access, please escalate to the Toolbox team for review.</p>

Why can&rsquo;t they make changes?</span></div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: Partners can make changes to their answers in the form until the Microsoft team has assigned the asset request to one of their team members for review. While the asset is in review by the Microsoft team, partners cannot make edits. If further information is required from the partner those details will be requested by the PEM. If there are edits or additional details a partner would like to make while the asset is in review they can work with their assigned PEM to make those updates.</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: The links to the final versions of assets shared with the partners are only good for 30 days. After 30 days, the link shared with the partner will expire. If the partner still needs access to the document, they should contact their PEM to request a new link. The partner should be encouraged to download the asset and save it to their files as the new link will also expire in 30 days.</p>
