<h3>1. Service types</h3>

<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Standard exchange (SE)</h4>

<p>The standard exchange (SE or EXC) is the most common method of returning a non-functioning hardware product to Microsoft. This means the product (device, accessory, or cover) must be shipped to Microsoft, and inspected for customer induced damage, before a replacement will be shipped. Microsoft will provide a prepaid shipping service in markets where the product was launched, but the customer must provide their own packing material and a sturdy shipping box.</p>

<h4><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a>1.2 Same unit repair (SUR)</h4>

<div>
<div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Not available in all markets or for all devices. Refer to the repair guidance specific to the customer&rsquo;s country for offer eligibility.</p>

<p>Same unit repair (SUR) means the product (device only) must be shipped to Microsoft, and will be extensively tested, cleaned, and repaired using Microsoft genuine parts. Devices will go through four passes of complete component testing and will be repaired according to the symptom code and repair description entered in the SOM tool. If the device is unable to be repaired, a refurbished exchange will be sent to the customer.</p>

<p>If the device completes the testing with no fault found, it will be returned to the customer after being reimaged with a fresh installation of Windows. For more information about No Fault Found (NFF), see <a bookmark-id="10" href="#10" managed-link=""><span>section 10</span></a>.</p>

<p>On the third repair, regardless of whether it was repaired or returned NFF, we will force an exchange to a refurbished ESKU.</p>

<h4><a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a>1.3&nbsp;Advanced exchange (AE)</h4>

<p>With an advanced exchange (AE), Microsoft will ship a replacement product to the customer first, and then the customer will send back their non-functioning product with the packing materials that were sent with the replacement. Microsoft covers the prepaid shipping for the non-functioning product to be returned. Collateral in the form of a credit card or invoice is required to proceed.</p>

<p>Failure to return the non-functioning product within 14 business days of delivery or returning a severely damaged non-functioning product may result in the customer being charged.</p>

<p>Advanced exchange availability varies by region, product, and warranty. See the exchange guidance specific to the country for more information.</p>

<h4><a id="1.4" name="1.4"></a>1.4 Send immediately (SEN)</h4>

<p>With a send immediately (SEN), Microsoft will ship a replacement product without expecting the non-functional product to be returned. These types of offers are typically reserved for low cost accessories or exception orders. If available, the SOM tool will give you this option.</p>

<h4><a id="2" name="2"></a>2.&nbsp;SE, SUR, and AE exchange guidance</h4>

<h4><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1 Information to review with the customer</h4>

<p>Before creating any exchange, review the following with the customer:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><strong>Device is brand new (Consumer only): </strong>Confirm with the customer whether the device is new or purchased within the last 30 days from a Microsoft Store. See KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3141412" target="_blank">3141412 Procedure: Surface: Coding the &quot;How did I resolve the Customer issue?&quot; field in ASD</a> for proper case coding.&nbsp;<strong>Note:</strong> Does not apply to Hong Kong and China.</span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span>Surface Support advocates should initiate an exchange in Purchase on Behalf of (POBO) for a new device on behalf of the customer if purchased within 30 days from the Microsoft Store. See KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4053527" target="_blank">4053527 TUG: MST: Purchase on behalf of (POBO)</a> section 10. Any subsequent issues (including out of stock scenarios) with the exchange process should be directed to Microsoft Store Sales support.&nbsp;<strong>Important</strong>: See KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4578369" managed-link="" target="_blank">4578369 Procedure: Purchase on behalf of (POBO) Consent</a> for information on POBO and mandatory consent actions.</span>

		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li><span>If the customer insists on a warranty exchange with Microsoft, advise them that they may receive a refurbished replacement (unless within the Early Warning Program period). See <a bookmark-id="7.2" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4514977#7.2" managed-link="" target="">section 7.2</a><span><span> </span></span> for more information.</span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><span>If purchased new from a third-party, advise the customer that they may be within the third-party retailers return period for exchange. <strong>Exception</strong>: For countries with an allowance model (see appropriate country article) if they insist on replacing it with Microsoft, process the request as directed above.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><strong>AE Only:</strong> <strong>Collateral</strong>: Microsoft requires collateral before creating an advanced exchange which differ between Consumer and Commercial.</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><strong>Consumer:</strong> A valid credit card is required to proceed with an advanced exchange and will hold for the full retail value of the product. This may affect the available balance until the hold is removed, which happens once the non-functioning product has been received by Microsoft and inspected for damage.</span></li>
		<li><span><strong>Commercial</strong>: The customer agrees that their company will be invoiced for the full price of a new product if the non-functioning product is not returned within 14 business days or a physically damaged product is received by Microsoft. See KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3105469" target="_blank">3105469 Procedure: Surface: Creating invoice billing for device exchanges</a> for further directions.</span></li>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><strong>SE and SUR:</strong> Turnaround time is defined by the date the customer physically ships the non-functioning product to the time a replacement is received. </span></li>
		<li><span><strong>AE:</strong> Turnaround time is defined as the next business day after the order is created to the time of delivery.</span></li>
		<li><span>Refer to the exchange guidance specific to the customer&rsquo;s country for turnaround information.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><strong>Warranty</strong>: Warranty post-replacement is 90 days or the remainder of the warranty, whichever is greater. For exceptions see the exchange guidance specific to the customer&rsquo;s country.</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><strong>SE and SUR: </strong>The warranty to repair or service the product will be applied to the replacement serial number once it has been shipped from the service center.</span></li>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span>Set proper expectations that if the customer doesn&rsquo;t perform all troubleshooting (including but not limited to a full recovery), the device may be returned after being restored to a factory state if it passes all our hardware tests.

<h4><a id="2.4" name="2.4"></a>2.4&nbsp;Advanced exchange for exceptions</h4>

<p>Consumer frontline advocates cannot process advanced exchange orders for most markets worldwide. Surface Super users, Surface Repair Specialists, Device Advanced Capability advocates (ACA), and the Global Repair Adviser team (GRAT) maintain the ability to create advanced exchange orders.</p>

<p>To qualify for an advanced exchange, the customer must fall within one of the following expectation categories:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Office professionals or school/college students who cannot be without their device and have agreed to use Credit Care for the advanced exchange option.</span></li>
	<li><span>Customers who have gone through multiple replacements back to back. The customer receives a faulty replacement after waiting for five days of Standard exchange and is not ready to wait for another five days to get another replacement.</span></li>
	<li><span>Customers have this as their only device and are finding it difficult to back up their data to be loaded on the new device when it arrives, especially customers who do not have high cloud storage space. While we can recommend products, such as OneDrive, they choose to back up onto a removable hard drive because that is what they are used to doing.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>You must reach out to the Surface Super Users/Repair Specialists who support your site if you have a customer who requests an Advanced exchange. If the customer does not meet any of the above criteria, Surface Super Users/Surface Repair Specialists should reach out to GRAT via TFS to request an exception. Approval from GRAT is not required for the above circumstances. Document any given scenario in your case notes where the Advanced exchange option is used.</p>

<h3>3. Send immediately exchange guidance</h3>

<h4><a id="3.1" name="3.1"></a>3.1 Information to review with the customer</h4>

<p>Before creating a SEN order, review the following with the customer:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><strong>No return required</strong>: Advise the customer that returning the non-functioning product is not required and should be discarded.</span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span>Refer the customer to locate appropriate local electronic recyclers for disposal<strong>. </strong>See <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/legal/compliance/recycling#Global-map" target="_blank">End-of-life Management and Recycling</a> for more information.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><strong>Turnaround time:</strong> The expected turnaround time from creating the order to when the replacement is to be received.</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span>Turnaround time is defined as the next business day after the order is created to the time of delivery.</span></li>
		<li><span>Refer to the exchange guidance specific to the customer&rsquo;s country for turnaround information.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><strong>Warranty</strong>: Warranty post-replacement is 90 days or the remainder of the warranty, whichever is greater. For exceptions see the exchange guidance specific to the customer&rsquo;s country.</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span>The warranty to repair or service the product will be applied to the replacement serial number once the replacement has been shipped.</span></li>

<h4><a id="3.2" name="3.2"></a>3.2 Commercial SEN specialty circumstances</h4>

<p>Specialty scenarios based on region, product type, or warranty status may be presented which may require different expectations with the customer.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><strong>Business Data Retention Plan</strong> (KYOD or Keep Your Own Device) is used when a customer has Microsoft Complete for Business Data Retention Plan. When a commercial customer has Microsoft Complete for Business Data Retention Plan, the SOM tool will only provide the Business Data Retention Plan offer.</span>

<h3>4.<strong> </strong>Out of warranty (OOW)</h3>

<h4><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 Out of warranty terms</h4>

<p>Once the warranty has elapsed or the customer has physically damaged the non-functioning product, the customer will be required to pay an out of warranty fee should a replacement be required. The service cost is the same for either scenario and can only be processed as a <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/#_1._Standard_Exchange" target="_blank">Standard exchange</a>.</p>

<p>Pricing varies by product/region and is not available in all regions or for all products. See <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4023535" target="_blank">Surface cracked screen or physical damage</a> for the out of warranty price list.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> To ensure you have the correct pricing, make sure the locale (represented by a four-letter code in the URL, for example en-us represents English-United States) is set for the region in question. You can change the locale by selecting the correct region in the lower left corner of the page.</p>

<h4><a id="4.2" name="4.2"></a>4.2 Customer induced damage</h4>

<p>On receipt of the customer&#39;s non-functioning product, the service center will examine the condition of the product received. If the customer&rsquo;s product was received by the service center in warranty (IW) and is found to have physical damage, it will be sent back as-is. When received, the customer will have options for OOW or Accidental Damage claim (ADP) if applicable except for liquid damage.</p>

<h4><a id="4.3" name="4.3"></a>4.3&nbsp;Out of warranty SE and AE general guidance</h4>

<p>Before creating an OOW service order, review the following with the customer:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><strong>Non-refundable:</strong> Once an OOW order has been completed and the customer has received the replacement, it is non-refundable. The order is refundable up to the point where the customer ships the device to us.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Warranty:</strong> Repair warranty is 90 days.</span></li>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-24">
<p><span><span><span>If the warranty has elapsed on the customer&rsquo;s product, the warranty on the replaced/repaired product will only be 90 days.

<h4><a id="4.4" name="4.4"></a>4.4 Out of warranty same unit repair</h4>

<p>Unlike standard exchange, same unit repair out of warranty offers tiered pricing depending on the symptom code selected to offer the customer more flexibility on repair options. Liquid damage is not repairable and will default to standard exchange only.</p>

<h4>5.&nbsp;Out of region</h4>

<p>All products manufactured by Microsoft have an intended destination market in which the product is expected to be sold. The marketplace is configured as part of the product SKU which determines the warranty length and exchange eligibility.</p>

<p>The Device Marketplace field can be found in all repair tools.</p>

<div>
<h4><a id="5.2" name="5.2"></a>5.2 What is out of region?</h4>

<p>Officially, the manufacturer&#39;s warranty on the product is only valid if the customer&rsquo;s product was officially released in the customer&rsquo;s country and purchased through an authorized retailer. For official warranty documents see <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/documents" target="_blank">Warranties, Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft is neither required nor obligated to provide warranty service options to customers who purchased or use their product outside of the country it was originally released.</p>

<p>For example, while Japan is an officially launched country, a product sold in the United States if used in Japan, is not officially covered by the terms of the manufacturer&rsquo;s warranty as the United States warranty does not cover usage in Japan.</p>

<p>Microsoft may offer warranty options for a product that is outside the warranty coverage, as a customer courtesy. <strong>This is not a customer entitlement,</strong> and the offer is subject to change at any time.

<h3>7.&nbsp;Warranty replacement products and product types</h3>

<h4><a id="7.1" name="7.1"></a>7.1 What do we ship customers as replacements</h4>

<p>All warranty replacement products shipped by Microsoft are refurbished (E-SKU or Exchange SKUs). Refurbished products may have minor cosmetic imperfections but will be tested and fully functioning.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><a bookmark-id="top" href="top#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="7.2" name="7.2"></a>7.2&nbsp;Types of products or SKUs</h4>

<p>There are four types of products or SKUs that Surface products fall under. The type of SKU will determine its cosmetic grade and warranty eligibility.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><strong>A-SKU</strong> (New or Retail) are products that have been purchased from retail. These should be in new condition from purchase.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>B-SKU</strong> (Refurbished for Sale) are products that may have some cosmetic imperfections but are tested and fully functioning. Sold as bundles with a power supply and intended for sale.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>E-SKU </strong>(Refurbished for Exchange) are products that may have some cosmetic imperfections but are tested and fully functioning. Only available as warranty replacements and not intended for sale.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>C-SKU </strong>(Retail Demos or liquidation SKUs) are products that are not eligible for warranty support. These products may have been retail demo units or sold in bulk to liquidation companies. These are actively blocked from all service order tools.</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">

<h3>8. End of life</h3>

<h3><a id="8.1" name="8.1"></a>8.1 What is end of life?</h3>

<p>Products that have reached end of life (EOL) means there is limited to no availability of replacement inventory due to it no longer being manufactured. Once a product has reached this point one of the following may occur:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>The warranty offers are removed so a repair or replacement may no longer be possible.</span></li>
	<li><span>There is a significant price increase for out of warranty options.</span></li>
	<li><span>There are upgrade offers in conjunction with increased out of warranty costs to move the customer to a newer device.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>See KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3073426" target="_blank">3073426 Procedure: Warranty End of Life (EOL) for devices &amp; accessories</a> for more information.</p>

<h4><a id="8.2" name="8.2"></a>8.2&nbsp;Product upgrades and alternatives</h4>

<p>As inventory availability allows, Microsoft may upgrade customers to the next generation of product for products nearing or at end of life. In general, the service offer will notify you that an upgrade will occur and to set expectations with the customer that they will be upgraded.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In rare cases due to high demand in certain regions, the customer may be upgraded without any notification at the discretion of Microsoft. Do <strong>not</strong> mention this to the customer unless they call back after receiving an upgrade.</p>

<h4><a id="8.3" name="8.3"></a>8.3&nbsp;End of life refunds</h4>

<p>In rare circumstances, there may not be a suitable upgrade path for the customer once a product has reached the end of its lifecycle and nothing has been released to directly replace it in terms of features or compatibility.</p>

<p>The repair tool will prompt when a refund is the only solution and an escalation should be raised as appropriate.</p>

<h3>9.&nbsp;Serialized vs. non-serialized</h3>

<h4><a id="9.1" name="9.1"></a>9.1&nbsp;What is a serialized product?</h4>

<p>Serialized products are products that have a serial number with an associated warranty in the SOM tool. The warranty information will be found by putting the serial number into the SOM tool. If the serial number doesn&rsquo;t return a warranty, it is a non-serialized product. Serial numbers that are associated to a serialized product are necessary to create a service order. Sometimes it is necessary to use a serialized product&rsquo;s serial number for an accessory sold bundled with the serialized product. When used this way it may be known as a parent device. When there is no parent device for a non-serialized product, see <a bookmark-id="9.3" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4514977#9.3" managed-link="" target="">section 9.3</a>.</p>

<p>Serialized products supported by Surface include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Surface devices (such as, Surface Pro, Surface Laptop, and Surface Duo)</span></li>
	<li><span>Surface Type Covers</span></li>
	<li><span>Surface Dock (199w PSU - only)</span></li>
	<li><span>Surface Headphones</span></li>

<h4><a id="9.2" name="9.2"></a>9.2&nbsp;What is a non-serialized product?</h4>

<p>Non-serialized products are defined internally to Microsoft as devices or accessories without a registerable serial number. While the product itself may have a serial number, inputting that serial number into the SOM tool will not be recognized. The warranty is defined by the customer&rsquo;s proof of purchase if the product was not bundled with a parent serialized device. For example, a Surface Mouse purchased separately.</p>

<p>Most Surface accessories are considered non-serialized and require a serialized product to create a service order when a replacement is required.</p>

<h3><a id="10" name="10"></a>10. No Fault Found (NFF)</h3>

<p>No Found Fault (NFF or NFR) is when a device that arrives for a repair is fully tested and determined to not have any hardware related faults after being reimaged with a fresh installation of the latest version of Windows or device specific OS.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: NFF is not available for all products or markets. Your SOM tool will prompt you when available.</p>

<p>The customer will be notified via the Device Tracker email if the device is being returned for NFF as well as a physical letter included with their device with a generic explanation of what was done. Currently the actual repair results are not available.</p>

<p>This will also be updated in the advocate SOM tool in the Device Tracker status page.</p>

<p>This will also be updated in the advocate SOM tool in the Device Tracker status page as NFF. If the device was found to fail testing, the below result codes will be presented to indicate the failure reason.</p>
