<header><h1>How to process a request for a SharePoint Online site restore</h1></header><div class="kb-symptoms-section section">This document defines the process to run a Point in Time Restore (PITR) for customer content within SharePoint Online. These are typically the result of a customer opening a support case with the request to restore data to a previous point in time. The process that&#39;s defined within this document must be followed for each request. This process will continue to change based on engineer feedback and the evolution of the service. If there are any questions about the PITR process, direct them to <a href="mailto:gbsspopitrhelp@microsoft.com" id="kb-link-1" target="_self">GBS SPO Site Restore Help</a>.</div>

<div class="kb-symptoms-section section"><a href="https://support.office.com/article/Restore-your-OneDrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15" managed-link="" target="_blank">Restore your OneDrive</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://support.office.com/article/restore-a-document-library-317791c3-8bd0-4dfd-8254-3ca90883d39a" managed-link="" target="_blank">Restore a document library</a>&nbsp;have been made publicly available to customers in SharePoint Online. Please consider reviewing these options with your customer as it may result in a much quicker resolution for the customer. Should these features not resolve the issue, please make sure to collect the details of the failure or why it did not meet the customer&#39;s needs and escalate to engineering (SNAP/ContentStore).</div>
<div class="kb-resolution-section section">If you&rsquo;re taking a new customer case and based on the initial notes, it seems that data has to be recovered on the site by using any method (recycle bin, versioning, or PITR), we have to act quickly to collect data and set expectations from the beginning.<br>
<br>
Examples of such a case might be where a customer calls out that they:
<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li>Are missing content from their site.</li>
	<li>Are missing a site or content was purged from the recycle bin that they have to recover.</li>
	<li>Have deleted columns from a list or library.</li>
	<li>Overwritten critical data on a site that must be recovered.</li>
</ul>
Ideally, our first contact with the customer is by using the telephone so that we can collect scoping data and help the customer as soon as possible. If our first contact with the customer is through an email message, here&#39;s an email template that you can consider using to set expectations accordingly and to quickly obtain important questions from the customer.

<div class="indent"><span class="sbody-italic">Hi &lt;Customer&gt;,</span><span class="sbody-italic"></span><br>

&nbsp;
<p><em>As it appears that we are going to be working towards recovering data, I&rsquo;d like to set some expectations right away. We&#39;ll first work towards recovering the content through the various methods available through the UI such as the recycle bin (<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/manage-the-recycle-bin-of-a-sharepoint-site-collection-5fa924ee-16d7-487b-9a0a-021b9062d14b" target="_blank">more information on the recycle bin)</a>, version history (<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/how-does-versioning-work-in-a-list-or-library-0f6cd105-974f-44a4-aadb-43ac5bdfd247" target="">more information on versioning</a>), or the OneDrive file restore (<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Restore-your-OneDrive-fa231298-759d-41cf-bcd0-25ac53eb8a15" target="_blank">more information on OneDrive file restore</a>). Should that not be possible, we can look at doing a restore of the site collection or subsite if necessary.</em></p>
<span class="sbody-italic">I do want to call out that we have a 14 day window to work within. If we decide a restore is the only option to move our case forward, the points in time in which we can restore to are limited to those within the 14 day window prior to the time the restored is executed. As such, we consider these data recovery cases to be very high priority. To get started, we&#39;ll need is as much detail about the missing content as you can provide. Please complete the information below and send it back to us as soon as you can.<br>

<div class="kb-collapsible kb-collapsible-collapsed">Whether it is through the first telephone call or email messages, on a case in which we are investigating a potential restore, acknowledge the request with the customer and then set the expectation that a restore may cause the following behavior:

	<li>For an whole site collection restore, changes that were made between the requested restore time and present time will be lost.</li>
</ul>
Advise the customer that you&#39;ll be trying to prevent the need for a restore by solving their issue. In order to fully understand the scope of the customer&rsquo;s restore request, document the answers to the following questions within the support case:

<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li>What is the URL of the site collection that contains the item, or items, that have to be restored?</li>
	<li>What is the URL to the item, or items, that has to be restored? If this is unknown, specify a location as close as possible.</li>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><br>
There are three scope options for a Point in Time Restore.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>1. <strong>Site collection to the same Url</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>- This is the preferred scope of restore as is a full fidelity restore and supports the widest range of scenarios, however as it is to the same Url the current site will be deleted in order to be replaced with the restored site. There will be downtime with this option and if the target is the root site, all sites will have downtime until the restore is complete.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>2. <strong>Site collection to a new Url</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>- This is a new option that is currently in preview. There will be no data loss or downtime impact to any existing sites so is ideal, however it is currently limited to sites less than 50 GB and is a best effort support scenario. If the site is greater than 50 GB or the PiTR should fail while creating the site backup or restoring the site from the backup, another option will need to be considered.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>3. <strong>Subsite (web/subweb)</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>- This is a best effort scenario, and may delay the overall restore process. This is not a full-fidelity restore. For example, Workflows, Apps from the App Store, checked-out items, and items in the recycle bin won&#39;t be restored. If the restore fails during export or import of the web, the only option is a site collection restore. This option is not available for the rootweb of a site collection.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span>Based on this information, the scope of the restore will be a URL in one of the following formats:</span></p>

<div class="kb-collapsible kb-collapsible-collapsed">
<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li>Site Collection: The URL should map to the root of a site collection.
	<ul class="sbody-free_list">
		<li>Example 1: https://<strong class="sbody-strong">&lt;<em>domain</em>&gt;</strong>.sharepoint.com</li>
		<li>Example 2: https://<strong class="sbody-strong">&lt;<em>domain</em>&gt;</strong>.sharepoint.com/sites/TeamSite</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Subweb or subsite: The URL should map to the subweb that&#39;s the target of the restore. This can&#39;t be a URL to the root of a site collection.
	<ul class="sbody-free_list">
		<li>Example 1: https://<strong class="sbody-strong">&lt;<em>domain</em>&gt;</strong>.sharepoint.com/subSite</li>
		<li>Example 2: https://<strong class="sbody-strong">&lt;<em>domain</em>&gt;</strong>.sharepoint.com/sites/TeamSite/subSite1/subSite2</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
After the scope of the restore is set, you must identify the point in time that the data should be restored from. The time should be selected based on the last known time in which the item, or items, were in the desired state, and must be no more than 14 days in the past. For example, consider the following scenario:

<div class="indent">The reason for the restore is that a document was noticed as missing on Friday. The last time any of the users are confident that the document existed was the previous Monday. In this scenario, the point in time for the restore should be set to a point before the user confirming the presence of the file on Monday.</div>
The actual point in time of the restore will typically be within 15 minutes of the time specified. A single point in time should be defined by using the understanding that the restore will likely be to several minutes before the specified time. This time has to be confirmed with the customer and provided as a UTC time in the following 24 hour format: MM-DD-YYYY hh:mm:ss. For example, 10/22/2014 4:43:00 UTC.<br>
<br>
<span class="text-base">Note</span> The point in time for the restore requested by the customer will be validated by the escalation resources before the execution of the PITR with the tools documented here. If the point in time given by the customer doesn&#39;t match the data returned by the tools available, additional review will be necessary.</div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="kb-collapsible kb-collapsible-collapsed"><em>Now that the scope and point in time are established, expectations around the restore process must be set correctly with the customer. These expectations can vary based on the restore scope determined in the previous step. The following verbatim should be sent to the customer in an email message. Make sure that the correct verbatim is sent based on the scope of the restore and document the customers consent to move forward with the restore within the support case before executing the restore. Whereas it isn&#39;t called out directly, the site collection verbatim that&#39;s listed here implies that the changes that occurred between the point in time of the restore and the restore execution time will be lost. This supports the fact that a second restore to revert the site to post-restore state shouldn&#39;t occur.&nbsp;</em>

			<h4 class="sbody-h4">Site collection - to the same Url</h4>
			The next course of action to move our support case forward is a restore of the site collection located at &lt;Insert Site Collection URL&gt;. In order to complete the restore, this site collection will first be removed and then will be replaced with a copy of the site from within 15 minutes of the established restore point (&lt;Insert Restore Time (UTC)&gt;). This process typically completes within 6 to 12 hours, but could take as long as 72 hours to complete. Considering the amount of time needed for the restore, it&#39;s important that there is a high level of confidence with the point in time that was chosen for the restore. If the root site collection of the tenant (ex: https://contoso.sharepoint.com) is the target for the restore, all sites within the tenant will be unavailable after the site is removed and will be inaccessible until the restore has been completed.<br>
			<span class="sbody-italic"></span><br>
			<span class="sbody-italic">Due to the nature of the restore and the site rollback, it&#39;s recommended that the following steps are taken prior to moving forward with the restore. </span>

			<ol class="sbody-num_list">
				<li><span class="sbody-italic">Users of the site collection should be notified that the site is now considered to be in a read-only mode as any changes made after the point in time for the restore will be lost.

				<li><span class="sbody-italic">In order to minimize data loss, the items that have been updated after the point in time specified for the restore should be saved to a local computer in order to replace the items upon completion of the restore.</span></li>
				<li><span class="sbody-italic">Please stop the synchronization of OneDrive sync clients on any libraries located under the path of this restore.</span></li>
			</ol>
			<span class="sbody-italic"></span><br>
			<span class="sbody-italic">Microsoft will notify you once the restore completes. Upon completion of the restore, the following steps should take place to complete the restore process:</span>

			<ol class="sbody-num_list">
				<li><span class="sbody-italic">The users should be notified that the site restore has completed and is again accessible for read/write activity.</span></li>
				<li><span class="sbody-italic">Any files that were backed up locally should be replaced within the site as needed.</span><span class="sbody-italic"></span></li>

Once you provide confirmation to move forward with the restore, Microsoft will start the restore process. </span><span class="sbody-italic"></span></p>

			<h4><span><span><span>Site collection - to a new Url</span></span></span></h4>

			<p><span><span><span>The next course of action to move our support case forward is a restore of the site collection located at &lt;Insert Site Collection URL&gt;. In order to complete the restore, a new site collection will be created from the backup created within 15 minutes of the established restore point (&lt;Insert Restore Time (UTC)&gt;). This process typically completes within 6 to 12 hours, but could take as long as 72 hours to complete. Considering the amount of time needed for the restore, it&#39;s important that there is a high level of confidence with the point in time that was chosen for the restore. The Url for the new site is typically the original Url with _Restored appended to the end, however if there are conflicts with that path the new Url will be communicated once it has completed.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><em><span><span><span>Due to the nature of the side-by-side restore, there a few points to note:</span></span></span></em></p>

			<ul>
				<li><em><span><span><span><span>The new site collection will be set in read-only mode. It is not intended to be a fully functional and utilized site, but rather a way to recover data that is otherwise unrecoverable. </span></span></span></span></em></li>
				<li><em><span><span><span><span>This new site collection will be crawled and thus will return in search results and will be accessible by those with access. As such, this may result in the restored items being inadvertently updated. You should plan to remove the restored site as soon as possible.</span></span></span></span></em></li>
				<li><em><span><span><span><span>If the restore fails for any reason, it will be immediately aborted. Once aborted, the only remaining option to restore the site collection to the same Url.</span></span></span></span></em></li>
			</ul>

			<p><em><span><span><span>Microsoft will notify you once the restore completes. Upon completion of the restore, the new site should be reviewed and content backed up/moved to the target location so that the restored site can then be removed.</span></span></span></em></p>

			<h4 class="sbody-h4">Subweb</h4>
			The next course of action aimed at moving our support case forward is to restore a copy of the subweb located at &lt;insert subweb URL&gt;. The subweb that currently exists at the specified URL won&#39;t be deleted. Instead, a copy of the subweb from the provided point in time will be restored alongside the original. The data within that subweb will reflect the state of subweb from within 15 minutes of the established restore point (&lt;Insert Restore Time (UTC)&gt;). This type of restore typically completes within 24 hours, but can take as long as 72 hours to complete.<span class="sbody-italic"><br>

<div class="kb-collapsible kb-collapsible-collapsed">At this point, the restore has completed and there may be some additional steps. In addition to the final cleanup steps, we also have to help the customer take action so that they can prevent the need for the restore in the future. Depending on the kind of restore that was completed, the final steps differ.
<h4 class="sbody-h4">Site collection - to the same Url</h4>

<p>Because the whole site collection was rolled back, there&#39;s little to do after the restore. If the customer backed up any content that was updated after the restore point in time, they&#39;ll have to add that content back to the site at this point.</p>

<h4>Site collection - to a new Url</h4>

<p>The new site collection will exist at a new URL. The duplicate site has the potential of causing confusion and should be addressed as soon as possible. The customer should take action to recover the intended content and restrict access or delete it as appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="sbody-h4">Subweb</h4>
The original subweb now exists on a new URL alongside the restore subweb. The duplicate site has the potential of causing confusion and should be addressed as soon as possible. The customer should take the needed action against the renamed subweb (depending on the reason for the restore) and then delete it as appropriate.

<h4 class="sbody-h4">General Guidance</h4>
The process of restoring a site is time-consuming and causes a disturbance with the user base. Therefore, this is a great opportunity to help the customer avoid future restores. Based on the need for the restore, the guidance here will differ. A list of suggestions for common restore reasons will be maintained here.</div>
