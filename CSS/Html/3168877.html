<h3><a id="CustomerSegmentation" name="CustomerSegmentation"></a> 1. Customer segmentation</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>All customers are either managed or unmanaged. During times of re-segmentation (the beginning and end of each fiscal half or typically June/July and December/January) it is common for the Sales teams to shift books of business. This can cause some confusion in ownership as customers are being moved from old to new segments or may be transitioning account teams. Exercise patience and diligence during these times and escalate any help needed to your TA.</span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>If a customer is listed as unsegmented with no account management team, this can be considered unmanaged/SMB and is eligible for full support. If the customer is listed as unsegmented with a designated account team assigned, always reach out to the assigned contact in UCM before proceeding with support on red scenarios.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Managed </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>High-spending advertisers who have a dedicated Account Team to support their account.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>They have an Account Team identified in UCM. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Unmanaged</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Medium or modest-spending advertisers who do not have a dedicated account team.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>These customers self-manage their accounts and contact our support teams if they run into any issues or need any help.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Internal Sales Support (such as, AM&rsquo;s or AE&rsquo;s)</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Account Manager inquiries are generally considered out of scope and inquiries coded as <strong>Misroute</strong>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>As of October 2020, chat support for India Sales House employees (InMobi) are in scope with limited capacity.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Chat support for internal employees in India should follow special verification, only be supported for select scenarios, and have their own TCO process. See <a bookmark-id="5" href="#5" managed-link=""><span>section 5</span></a></span></span><span> </span><span><span> <span>for details. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span>Nothing is changing with regard to our support of <strong>customers</strong> in India when those customers contact us directly. Continue to follow segmentation protocol for customer support scenarios.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><strong><span><span>Channel partners are a type of advertiser model that often mimics an agency or reseller set up. Typically, the primary partner has direct contact with the account team, while the reseller accounts (aka long tail advertisers) will rely on either the primary partner or CSS for support. </span></span></strong></span></p>

			<p><span><strong><span><span>CSS&nbsp;</span></span>support model: Only the &ldquo;Partners&rdquo; within in this segment will have a dedicated account team listed in UCM.&nbsp;</strong>The type of support CSS provides can only be identified at the account level by checking for the red CP CSS label in UCM (see directions below). Due to constant change, partners under the &ldquo;Wordstream&rdquo; customer shell should also be considered fully supported (whether or not they have the CP-CSS label). Accounts with this label in UCM indicate that the account is eligible for full support (all scenarios, no need to contact or inform AM). Customers identified as channel partners who do not have the label, follow typical managed account scenarios (with only red scenarios being out of scope), in which case the AM would be contacted for assistance and UCM updates provided following CSS assistance.</span></p>

			<p><span><strong><span><span>Services model: Currently no channel partners are eligible for an outbound services consultation. Channel partners are eligible to receive assistance from the services team if the client calls inbound or we receive a lead via the Scheduling Tool.</span></span></strong></span></p>

			<p><span><strong><span><span><span> </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Here is how to see if an XID is fully CSS support eligible:</span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></p>

			<ol>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span>Enter the advertiser&rsquo;s XID in the search box and confirm if that XID falls under the <strong>Channel Partner</strong><em> </em>segment.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the XID does fall under <strong>Channel Partner</strong>, then select the <strong>Search Result</strong> link in the breadcrumb.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span>The search result will reveal whether that XID has the red CSS Support label, <strong>CP CSS</strong>. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
			</ol>

			<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span> You may need to expand (<strong>+</strong>) the account view to see the label</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span>Beginning October 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020, we have agreed to support Sales House POC&rsquo;s in India if they reach out to us via chat only, for questions that would help resolve their customer inquiries. We will not be customer facing or make changes to customer accounts, and we will only assist the India Sale House partners by providing quick answers and the correct internal POCs or information to resolve their customer inquiries. </span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong>Nothing is changing regarding our support of <strong>customers</strong> in India when those customers contact us directly, continue to follow segmentation protocol for customer support scenarios.</p>

<h4><span><span><span><a id="5.1" name="5.1"></a>5.1 Support process for internal chat</span></span></span></h4>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Process details: </span></span></span></strong><span>Chat only support had unique fortification, green scenarios, ticket coding, and TCO. Refer to the processes below to ensure accuracy.<strong> </strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Modality used:</span></strong> Chat only</p>

<p><strong><span>InMobi/AM requestors are expected to:</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span> Use their <a href="mailto:b-@microsoft.com">b@microsoft.com</a> email only (it is also possible they will use their @inMobi alias, but this should be on rare occasions).</span></li>
	<li><span> Must complete the prechat survey.</span></li>
	<li><span> Selfidentify in chat that they are &ldquo;inMobi India Sales House AM&rdquo;.</span></li>
	<li><span> Not complete survey after chat has ended/closed (no postchat survey completion).</span></li>
	<li><span> Contact us for green scenarios only (note that these only include general product, process, and troubleshooting).</span></li>
	<li><span> Kindly be redirected to the correct team for all other scenarios (for example, provide pushback using canned response and share the appropriate escalation POC).</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span>Ticket coding:</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span> Always use &lsquo;Amber&rsquo; Color Emerging Issue Code.</span></li>
	<li><span> Code remainder of ticket appropriately.</span></li>
	<li><span> No need to escalate on behalf of requestor.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span>TCO process:</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span> Expect outreach to conclude with answered question (i.e. first contact resolution, with minimal follow up or open tickets expected).</span></li>
	<li><span> If additional customer/account information or details are needed from the AM, CSS does not wait for the AM before closing the ticket as resolved</span></li>
	<li><span> CSS will send one followup email, then close our ticket.</span></li>
	<li><span> Standard seven days reopen policy applies (AM&rsquo;s can come back within this timeframe if follow up is needed on their same query).</span></li>
	<li><span> Like our advertisers, there may be multiple questions per chat contact; however, we follow standard protocol of one ticket per issue, when possible (or per account).</span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span>Escalation protocol:</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span> Feedback or assistance from InMobi should come via: <a href="mailto:themets@microsoft.com">themets@microsoft.com</a> alias.</span></li>
	<li><span> Feedback or assistance from CSS to InMobi should come to: <a href="mailto:themets@microsoft.com">themets@microsoft.com</a> alias.</span></li>

<h4><a id="5.2" name="5.2"></a>5.2&nbsp;<span><span><span>FAQ for India (InMobi) support</span></span> </span></h4>

<p><span><strong>Q: What scenarios will we support? Is it the same red/green scenarios as we do for &lsquo;managed advertisers&rsquo;?</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: We have created new red/green scenarios for this support model (as outlined above). We will only support Green Scenarios or questions that come from internal stakeholders that do not require changes in the account. Most of our assistance will be answering general questions or recommending the Sales House POC reaches out to the appropriate team. The red/green scenarios anything in the account.</p>

<p><span><strong>Q: It was mentioned that the request will be primarily <u>informational only</u>. Since the scenarios will include general product, process, and troubleshooting, does this also mean that any escalation will be handled by the &lsquo;AM&rsquo; and we just need to give them the right direction on where to escalate and whatnot?</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: Yes, exactly. We will <strong>only</strong> be providing advice and guidance, without doing the work on behalf of the AM or advertiser. We cannot make changes in the UI, even if the AM requests, we do so. We will <strong>only</strong> be offering our recommendations (such as, investigative, suggesting opportunities, performing troubleshooting, or recommending another escalation point).</p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: Do we still need to perform ASD fortification/manual verification or do we just check for the AM&#39;s name/email in the account team in UCM? In case the alignment in UCM is not updated, what should we do to authenticate the AM? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span>A</span></strong><span>: The person contacting you is unlikely to be in UCM (only the Sales House leads are in UCM, not the AM/vendor team supporting the customers). For that reason, the Sales House desiring our support is required to:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Use their <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:b-@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">b-@microsoft.com</a> alias when chatting in.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Declare that they are with InMobi, supporting customers via the India Sales House.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Once they identify as an InMobi rep that is supporting our customers, you can proceed with their general customer questions. If they do not provide this information proactively, we should assume it is not a supportable scenario. </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: Is there any scenario where CSS would be required to contact the advertiser directly? If not, do we have any talking points we can use in case an AM does make this request? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span>A</span></strong><span>: At this time, we should not be contacting the advertiser directly or taking requests from the AM to contact them. If this occurs, I urge you to escalate via themets. </span></p>

<p><span>Messaging for this scenario:</span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><em><span>&ldquo;Our team is not scoped to provide proactive outreach to advertisers that have been identified as being supported by the InMobi Sales House. We can offer our assistance to your team with general guidance on delivery/performance issues and product or process questions.&rdquo;</span></em></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: Do we have any talking points in case an AM requests for CSS to make changes to the account? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span>A</span></strong><span>: Messaging for this scenario:</span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><em><span>&ldquo;Our team cannot make changes to an advertisers account at the request of an Account Representative. We can offer our assistance to your team with general guidance on delivery/performance issues and product or process questions, allowing you to support your customer or provide recommendations back to your customer to improve the performance of their account.&rdquo;</span></em></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: Do the AMs have access to the internal SDK knowledge base? Can share or refer them to SDK articles when answering their queries? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span>A</span></strong><span>: AM&rsquo;s do not have access to the CSS KB. The Sales House model will have their own training repository and use of standard external resources (such as, help content). If questions cannot be easily answered, use our red/green scenarios matrix to redirect them to the appropriate team to assist appropriately. Known process gaps can be shared via themets and we will coach accordingly. </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: Is Achieve more still required for these AM contacts? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span>A</span></strong><span>: Yes. We expect that the bulk of this work will be advising and providing resources or recommendations. It is assumed that doing this work will provide ample ability to achieve more.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>Q: As stated below, they shouldn&rsquo;t be completing post survey, would they be blocked in doing so and if not, would surveys coming from them be scrubbed (in case we receive)?</strong></span></p>

<p><strong>A</strong>: No, they will not be blocked from completing the post survey. However, this is something we will be watching and coaching to. It is also okay for you to remind them there is no need to do so.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><em><span>&ldquo;Thank you for contacting our Support Team today. We appreciate the opportunity to help with your customer scenario. The survey you will receive after our chat <strong>is not valid</strong> for internal users and we ask that you please do not complete it. If you do have feedback to share, please consider sending an email to our leads via <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:themets@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">themets@microsoft.com</a>. Thank you&rdquo;</span></em></p>

<p><span><strong>Q: TCO process provided below is different from our current TCO which might confuse our advocates. Is there a reason behind it? Or can we just stick with our current TCO process?</strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong>A</strong>: <span>TCO has been updated so that we close the ticket immediately after the interaction. For instances where the AM needs to obtain more information from the advertiser, it means we can reopen the ticket for up to seven business days. We are not expected to conduct follow-up to the AM when more information is needed to answer their question, that responsibility is with them. In rare instances where the CSS advocate needs more information to accurately answer the question, we may consider follow up, but this should not be a common scenario. We will not limit the number of questions the AM can ask, but we should limit by account (for example, questions pertaining to a new account should be coded as a new ticket). </span></span></p>
