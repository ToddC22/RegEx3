<h3><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>What is this article about?</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising allows certain advertisers to join the Microsoft Advertising Adult Advertising (AA) Program. This Program allows advertisers to bid on approved adult keywords in the following countries:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li><span>United States</span></li>
	<li><span>Canada</span></li>
	<li><span>United Kingdom</span></li>
	<li><span>Republic of Ireland</span></li>
	<li><span>France</span></li>
	<li><span>Germany</span></li>
	<li><span>Taiwan </span></li>
	<li><span>Australia (content limited to adult toys and dating sites)</span></li>
	<li><span>New Zealand (content limited to adult toys and dating sites)</span></li>
</ul>

<p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: As of February 19th, 2019, Yahoo! advertising policy no longer allows adult content to be shown on either Yahoo! Owned &amp; Operated or Yahoo! Syndicated partners. Adult advertisers may see a drop in performance from this date because of the change in Yahoo!&rsquo;s policy. See &ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t I advertise on Yahoo! anymore?&rdquo;<strong> </strong>in <a bookmark-id="4" href="#4" managed-link=""><span>section 4</span></a></span></span></span><span> </span><span><span><span> for more information. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Once an account is enabled for Adult advertising and the advertiser has been notified and sent to the AA webpage, the advertiser will be supported by the AA support team just as other regular search advertisers are supported by the standard support teams. For example, the editorial appeals process will be the same&mdash;except that the Adult advertiser will be supported by the AA support team through the process. For unresolvable issues, escalate the issue to Global Support via ASD per the usual process.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Keep in mind that ads and keywords that are flagged as Adult content are restricted from displaying in the Microsoft Advertising user interface unless the user or support person has the appropriate permissions to view such ads. In this case, work with your L2 who has permissions to view the content.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>

We will find and manually review the ad you saw, and if it violates the Microsoft Advertising Policies, we will promptly remove it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In line with our commitment to Internet safety, Bing search users can prevent adult text ads from appearing in the search results by selecting <span>Strict</span> mode on Bing.com:</p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" type="1">

</ol>

<p>In addition, no matter which search mode a user has selected, adult ads are only served on exact match keywords, so only users explicitly looking for this type of content will see the adult advertising. In other words, a searcher would have to enter the exact keyword(s) on which the adult advertiser bid to view that particular advertisement.

<p><span class="rangySelectionBoundary"></span><strong>Note:</strong><span> Only share the responses in this FAQ reactively.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: </span>Why can&rsquo;t I advertise on Yahoo! anymore? <span><br>
A: </span></strong><span>Verizon Media has made a business decision to no longer participate in the Adult Marketplace and therefore the volume of traffic coming from their publishers will no longer be available to our Adult Advertisers. Verizon Media, as do our other Publisher Partners, have the right to participate in whichever verticals that align with their business objectives.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: What is the SLA for adult enablement reviews?<br>
A: </span></strong><span>Three business days.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: How does the decision to offer adult advertising reconcile with the Microsoft core family values?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> As a company, and as individuals, we value integrity, honesty and openness. We continue to strive to meet these values by offering adult ads in an open and direct manner. We hold ourselves accountable by honoring these core corporate values while striving to meet the highest quality in our offering through a controlled Adult Vertical Expansion; driving results for our advertisers and enabling a better experience for Bing end users.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: I&rsquo;m calling on behalf of [child protective, religious, political action, media or other group] and we want you to know that we think it&rsquo;s just awful that Bing is allowing adult marketplace advertising! How can you possibly ensure safety when you&rsquo;re allowing adult content?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> Thank you for calling&mdash;we value your feedback. I am happy to walk you through your options in Bing&rsquo;s SafeSearch settings. I can also assure you that careful thought and consideration went into this decision and we have not compromised our unwavering commitment to internet safety. Microsoft&rsquo;s number one priority is to help create a safe environment for its online consumers. Microsoft works every day with lawmakers and law enforcement officials in many countries to promote stronger online safety and privacy legislation and internet safety education in schools. We help train law enforcement personnel in using technology to help combat online child pornography, child predators and child exploitation. We use filtering tools within Microsoft&rsquo;s online properties and are working with officials in several countries to deploy the Child Exploitation Tracking System (CETS), a software tool to help investigators share and analyze information for tracking child exploitation on the internet.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: What guidelines do the adult advertisers have to adhere to&mdash;how will you ensure the policy is enforced?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> The selected adult vertical advertisers must agree to the Microsoft Advertising terms &amp; conditions and the Microsoft Advertising Adult Advertising Program Agreement, and may be subject to additional content restrictions to participate in this Adult Vertical Expansion. Adult ads are subject to additional screening in editorial review of the ad creative and the landing page during the early phases of the vertical expansion to ensure the consumer has a safe, relevant and valuable search experience. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: Why is Microsoft getting into the adult marketplace&mdash;is this all about gaining additional revenue?</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>North America A: </span></strong><span>T</span><span>he revenue potential is certainly a factor in our decision, but it&rsquo;s not based solely on revenue. We are responding to growing market demand from advertisers for an adult search advertising offering. We are committed to making our search advertising a more compelling offering in a market that is dominated by a single player. This is one small step out of many that happens to pertain to a select group of advertisers. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>EMEA A: </span></strong><span>We are responding to growing market demand from advertisers for an adult search advertising offering. In addition, offering adult ads in a safe and controlled manner improves the search experience for the consumers that are searching for this type of content.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: What are you doing to prevent minors or other uninterested parties from seeing adult content?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> In line with our commitment to internet safety, when a user chooses <strong>Strict</strong> as the setting for the SafeSearch option in Bing, text ads featuring adult content will not appear. Additionally, adult ads will only be on exact match keyword, meaning only people explicitly looking for this type of content will be likely to see this type of advertising. A searcher would have to enter the exact keyword or keywords on which the advertiser bid to receive that particular text advertisement. To learn more, Microsoft offers extensive guidance to help consumers and families address online safety issues at </span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/security" managed-link="" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com/security</a><span> and </span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/family-safety" managed-link="" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com/security/family-safety</a><span>.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: How much wider of an audience can we reach by enabling the adult keyword vertical?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> According to Top Ten Review, anywhere from 15-25% of search volume is adult related. We estimate that our current adult keyword list will likely cover 50% of the adult vertical, which equates to about 7% of total search volume. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: What will happen if an advertiser that has NOT been adult-approved has ads currently serving on terms that are classified as adult?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> These ads will be disapproved if the advertiser has not been enabled for adult ads. The currently approved keywords that are classified as adult will stop serving for non-adult advertisers at release. These terms will not show as disapproved&nbsp;but will just be blocked at delivery. The adult terms will then be disapproved in manual editorial review for non-adult advertisers as soon as they resubmit.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: How should I structure my account if I have both adult and non-adult content?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> You must have separate shell accounts for your adult creative and non-adult creative. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: How does the adult marketplace affect sex toy advertisers?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> Sex toy advertisers will now be considered part of the adult marketplace and will be subject to the same policies and review practices. Sex toy-related search queries will be restricted to exact match and only delivered when a search user&rsquo;s browser setting is set to moderate or where SafeSearch is turned off.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: How will you ensure there is no exposure of child pornography or any other illegal sexually explicit content?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> The adult vertical is limited to a small number of advertisers, and we currently have a number of mechanisms in place to prevent illegal content and content that violates our editorial policies. We are limiting the initial Adult Vertical Expansion keyword list, conducting thorough editorial reviews for participating advertisers and requiring new accounts for participating advertisers to ensure no legacy &ldquo;permissioning&rdquo; is transitioned over. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: Is there anything users can do to restrict adult text ads?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> In line with our commitment to internet safety, Bing search users can prevent adult text ads from appearing in the search results by selecting <strong>Strict</strong> mode on Bing.com:</span></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" type="1">
	<li><span><span>Select </span>the <strong>Preferences</strong> icon in the top right corner of Bing.com. </span></li>
	<li><span>In the <strong>General settings</strong> section under <strong>SafeSearch</strong>, select the <strong>Strict</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong> or <strong>Off</strong> radio button. </span></li>
	<li><span><span>Select </span>the <strong>Save</strong> button.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>In addition, no matter which search mode a user has selected, adult ads are only served on exact match keywords, so only users explicitly looking for this type of content will see the adult advertising. In other words, a searcher would have to enter the exact keyword(s) on which the adult advertiser bid to receive that particular advertisement. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: What if an advertiser is bidding on two similar terms?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> One variation will be disallowed for exact-matching into an adult keyword, and the other could be allowed to serve according to policy after PMA review. Any keywords that are on the exact match approved adult keyword list will be blocked at delivery, but a similar term may still serve until resubmission, when these would be disapproved. For example, &ldquo;sex dating&rdquo; is on the adult list and is currently serving for some dating advertisers. As of the release, this term would stop serving but a similar term &ldquo;sex dating Seattle&rdquo; would still show. Upon resubmission, both of these terms would be disapproved for a non-adult advertiser. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: Why am I limited to bidding on exact match only<br>
A:</span></strong><span> We remain deeply committed to internet safety and are taking steps to minimize unwanted exposure to adult content via search advertising. To ensure that ads are served only to users who want adult content, we will only allow approved, unambiguous, exact match keywords and excluding all ambiguous terms.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: What are the steps to set the SafeSearch to &ldquo;Strict?&rdquo;<br>
A:</span></strong><span> Here are the steps to establish a SafeSearch level:</span></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" type="1">
	<li><span><span>Select </span>the <strong>Preferences</strong> icon in the top right corner of Bing.com. </span></li>
	<li><span>In the <strong>General settings</strong> section under <strong>SafeSearch</strong>, select the <strong>Strict</strong>, <strong>Moderate</strong> or <strong>Off</strong> radio button. </span></li>
	<li><span><span>Select </span>the <strong>Save</strong> button.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>SafeSearch settings transfer over to a user&rsquo;s mobile device if they are signed in with their Microsoft account.</span></p>

<p><span>In addition, no matter which search mode a user has selected, adult ads are only served on exact match keywords so only users explicitly looking for this type of content will see the adult advertising. In other words, a searcher would have to enter the exact keyword(s) on which the adult advertiser bid to receive that particular advertisement. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Mobile Ads</span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: Can I create adult ads for mobile devices</span></strong><span>?<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Yes, adult ads will now serve through mobile search on hi-fi devices (for example, iPhone, Android, Windows Phone, etc.). Ads will serve in the following countries: the US, Canada, the UK, Republic of Ireland, France, Germany and Taiwan (sex toys only). Additional markets will most likely be added in the future.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: What mobile device types will you support?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> We will support mobile adult campaigns for advanced smartphones like the iPhone, Android and Windows Phones and for lower-end feature phones that are capable of supporting text ads.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: Will mobile follow the same process for adult ads as PC?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> Yes, mobile adult ads will be subject to the same editorial guidelines and processes as PC ads. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Q: Do I need to load mobile-specific content?<br>
A:</span></strong><span> Although it is not technically required, our recommended best practice is that you have mobile-specific content. This is especially true for lo-fi feature-phone devices, as they mostly do not support many web-based display technologies such as Flash.</span></p>
