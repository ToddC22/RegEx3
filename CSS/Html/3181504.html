<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The Share of Voice report gives you an estimate on where you are losing to competitors in the marketplace.

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>You can also view what percentage of clicks an advertiser&#39;s ads are receiving compared to competing ads (click share). For example, if you find that 80% of an advertiser&#39;s impression share has been lost to budget, you can easily help him or her adjust to capture more relevant traffic. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Reporting data is kept for specified periods of time. If you want to learn how far back hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, yearly and summary aggregated data can be retrieved for a report.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: Share of Voice reports require enough impression share data for Microsoft Advertising to accurately calculate an advertiser&rsquo;s Share of Voice.

Auction insights is available in Intelligence and on the <strong>Campaigns </strong>page in Microsoft Advertising online.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Notes:</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Auction Insights data is only kept for 180 days.</span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>The metrics used in Auction Insights are: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Impression share %</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> &ndash; The number of impressions you received divided by the estimated number of impressions you were eligible to receive.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Average position</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> &ndash; The average rank of the ad in the auctions, which determines the order of the ads on the search results page. For example, an ad position of 4 means that, on average, your ad will be in 4th place on search results pages.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Overlap rate</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> &ndash; How often another participant&rsquo;s ad received an impression when your ad also received an impression. For example, if one of the other participants in your auction insights report is showing &ldquo;19%&rdquo; in the overlap rate column, this means that in 19 out of every 100 times your ad showed, an ad from this participant showed as well.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

For example, if one of the other advertisers is showing &ldquo;85%&rdquo; in the position above rate column, this means that the other participant&rsquo;s ad showed in a position above yours in 85 out of every 100 times your ads showed at the same time.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Top of page rate</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> &ndash; How often your ad (or the ad of another participant) was shown at the top of the page, which is the mainline position above the organic search results.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Outranking share</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> &ndash; The percentage of time your ad showed up higher on the search results pages than your competitors, or your ad showed when theirs did not.

<h3>5. Troubleshooting</h3>

<h4><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="5.1" name="5.1"></a>5.1 Ad duplication tracking</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Currently, mainline (ML) position ads can be duplicated to also show in bottom of page (BOP) position during the same search query. This is by design, though the frequency of duplication varies between Bing and our partner networks (such as, Bing and Yahoo). </span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>To ensure we are tracking the number of impressions accurately, Bing will record ML and BOP as two <strong>separate</strong> impressions and assign each impression a separate &lsquo;token id&rsquo;. For example: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Search user enters keyword &lsquo;Contoso Laptops&rsquo;.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>An ad for Contoso is shown in ML, and the same advert is duplicates in BOP.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Customer clicks Contoso&rsquo;s ML advert. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>When Contoso&rsquo;s account manager checks reporting, they will see two&nbsp;ad impressions, and one click. </span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Ad duplication FAQ: </span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why do you use this logic?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>To avoid incorrectly inflating CTR, we track an impression any time an instance of this ad is shown in Bing search results. This is an industry standard logic that we have adopted to help advertisers make more accurate performance assessments. </span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q:&nbsp;Do ML and BOP ads compete with one another for performance?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>&nbsp;No. BOP ads are a duplication of ML, and do not inflate CPC. We assign a separate &lsquo;token id&rsquo; purely so that we can accurately report impressions. </span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q:&nbsp;A customer wants to know why his CTR has dropped and/or why we are tracking separately for when the same advert shows to the same customer in the same search.&nbsp; What should we tell them?&nbsp; (Note: this question will only apply in the first few weeks following GA on July 31<sup>st</sup> &ndash; after metrics have stabilized, no &lsquo;sudden&rsquo; drop in CTR due to this behavior is expected.)</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Depending on the publishing website, adverts that show in the Mainline positions may also be duplicated at the bottom of the page &ndash; this helps increase your chances or receiving a click from a customer.&nbsp; To help track impressions accurately, we use the industry-standard practice of treating duplicated ads as separate impressions. Rest assured these will not be competing against each other for performance, and you will only be charged once per click as normal regardless of which ad the customer clicks. </span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Can I turn off duplication?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Because Mainline/Bottom of Page duplicate is controlled by the website publisher, this is not a feature that can be controlled in Microsoft Advertising&rsquo;s UI.&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: What reports are impacted by ad duplication tracking?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Only reports that rely on impressions as a part of their calculation will be impacted. As this is a global change, all advertisers will be impacted equally, and so no damage to performance or competitiveness will be experienced.</span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="5.2" name="5.2"></a>5.2&nbsp;Time zone settings</h4>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>When you create a report request, specify the date range based on the time zone of the campaign. The report data is stored in the time zone of the campaign. For example, if the time zone of the campaign is Pacific Time and a click occurs at 12 PM Eastern Time, the time of the click is recorded as 9 AM. If you request a report for the campaign using hourly aggregation, the report data will include a click that occurred at 9 AM (the report data is not adjusted based on the local time zone of your campaign).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Though rare, there are a few reasons for why an advertiser might see this phenomenon. See these troubleshooting steps and insights:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Remember that reporting can have latency; impressions data may not have finished compiling before click data has been counted.</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> Check the data on the following day, to see if this has updated. (As a best practice, checking a day&rsquo;s data on the following day is always preferable for a complete report.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Run a Keyword Performance Report and add &lsquo;Low Quality&rsquo; as a column.</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> You may find that impressions were deemed &lsquo;low quality&rsquo; and discounted from reporting, but the click was still registered because a search user clicked the ad.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note that some browsers may cache search results</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> (including ads) for speed of retrieval. Cached data isn&rsquo;t triggered by Microsoft Advertising, so a new impression isn&rsquo;t registered, but a click on cached data will still register as a new click.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Advertisers may see additional clicks in weblogs, due to allowed Search user behaviour.</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> For example, Search users may be comparison shopping or returning to a site (via a sponsored result) for more information.<br>
	Additionally, if a Search user clicks an ad multiple times, with a sufficient delay between clicks, these will be registered as valid. (Some browsers and search experiences may open sponsored results in a new tab, for example, and leave the search page open&hellip;if the customer navigates back and clicks again on the same ad, it will be charged again but only a single impression will have been registered.)</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Some IP providers assign a single IP to multiple users at a location.</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> It is therefore important to note that multiple clicks from the same IP may still be valid as they originate from different users.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
