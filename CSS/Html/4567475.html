<h3><span>Support Scenarios</span><span lang="EN-IN"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-IN"><span> </span></span></h3>

<h4><span lang="EN-IN">Credit or Refund </span></h4>

<p>For guidance on how to credit or refund a customer via CST, follow the <em>Issuing Refunds</em> section of the TUG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4487934">TSG 4487934</a>.</p>

<h4><span lang="EN-IN">Amend an Invoice</span></h4>

<p>In addition to a customer receiving a credit or refund, customers may ask to have their invoice amended. In these situations, you should note the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>N<span>ot every processed refund requires an amended invoice.</span><span lang="EN-IN"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-IN"><span> </span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When an invoice paid with a credit card is amended, the earlier overpaid amount is issued&nbsp;as a refund to the credit card on the 10th day after the generation of the new, amended invoice.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When an invoice is paid via wired transfer or check,&nbsp;<strong>do not</strong>&nbsp;amend the invoice. The credits (processed&nbsp;refund) will flow to the&nbsp;next invoice.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If a customer has not yet paid an invoice, it can be amended regardless of the payment method.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Before amending an invoice, please be sure that a minimum of two hours have elapsed since the last operation on the invoice.</p>

<p>To have an invoice amended, do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Send a collaboration task to your TA/PTA following the normal engagement process outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/2929022">TSG 2929022</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Your TA will review the request and follow the TA-only actions below to amend the invoice:</p>

	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>
		<p><span> In CST, click <strong>Amend</strong>.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>For Amendment Type, select <span><em>Recalculate Invoice</em>.</span><span lang="EN-IN"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-IN"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-IN"><span> </span></span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>For Reason, select <em>Refund</em>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Enter any relevant comments, and then click <strong>Next</strong>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Click <strong>Submit</strong>.<span lang="EN-IN"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-IN"><span> </span></span></p>

		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li>
			<p><span>This will amend the current invoice, taking the <em>Refund</em> into account. The system will expect the new amount post-adjustment, and that amount will be charged to the credit card.</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
