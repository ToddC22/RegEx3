<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Dunning overview</h3>

<p>Dunning is an internal term used to describe a subscription account with a past due balance. This results from a bad payment instrument, either a credit card that has expired or a prepaid balance that has been exhausted and can&rsquo;t cover their payment.</p>

<p><span>Scenario: A customer has purchased a Microsoft 365 subscription with recurring billing. The customer&rsquo;s credit card expired after a couple of years. When Microsoft tries to charge the credit card, the customer will get a decline message from the bank. They will later open Office and get a message that they need to update their billing account information to ensure that Office continues to work.<br>
<br>
If Microsoft billing system isn&rsquo;t able to charge the customer it will kick off what is called a dunning cycle. A dunning cycle is a process based on a preconfigured schedule to periodically ping the user (customer) to perform a certain action. Each failed ping will result in certain actions, such as reminder email, a locked account, or ban PI.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Important</span></strong><span>: Per </span><span>Corporate, External, and Legal Affairs</span><span> (CELA) guidance, <strong>do not</strong> communicate the grace period to customers.</span></p>

<h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Dunning cycle</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the current behavior of dunning:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span>During the first 27 days: We will continue to retry billing seven times, every three to four days. Seven email alerts are sent to the customer, and the customer can still use the product.</span></li>
	<li><span>After 27 days: The subscription is suspended, and the Skype monthly plan is canceled. OneDrive still functions properly. The&nbsp;customer can still use Office. The Microsoft billing system will try to bill the customer three more times evenly spaced throughout this period. Alerts will appear within the product about a billing problem, which points to the user&rsquo;s <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://account.microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com</a> page where they can update their payment information.</span></li>
	<li><span>After 54 days: The subscription enters the expired state. A customer now only has a grace period of five to seven days of full functionality.</span></li>
	<li><span>After 59 to 61 days: Office goes into <strong>Reduced Functionality Mode</strong>, and access to Office through other devices (mobile, slate) will be denied. </span>
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li><span>No further attempts are made at billing the customer.</span></li>
		<li><span>If the customer renews in this period: </span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li><span>The subscription is restored to <strong>Active status</strong>.</span></li>
			<li><span>The subscription anniversary date changes to the date on which the charge succeeds.</span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><span>After 90 days: The subscription enters a canceled state and cannot be renewed. The extra 1TB of OneDrive is removed from the customer&rsquo;s account.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>Microsoft will never remove the customer&rsquo;s data on OneDrive simply because their subscription has expired. However, they may not be able to upload files. If the customer has a OneDrive plan for 100GB a year and if they cancel Office subscription, the customer won&rsquo;t be able to upload a file if it exceeds their storage size of 100GB.</p>
