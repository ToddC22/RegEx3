			<p>Engineering has worked with CCM (Cloud Cost Management) to put <a href="https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/usage" managed-link="">usage data into the Ibiza portal</a>.</p>

			<p>Engineering does have the data in our internal Daily Usage Details cube, but each request will take someone about an hour&rsquo;s time or more to manually pull the data, and there is zero guarantee that it will be exactly the same as the sponsorship cube, which opens up an entire new set of issues. They are not going to sign up for this unless the circumstances are genuinely compelling for a specific customer, and won&rsquo;t provide under any circumstances recurring updates. They are not staffed to do that. So continue to inform customers that usage reports for Sponsorship offers do not have instance level details as of now.</p>

	<p>Bizspark &ndash; various levels, but main ones are &ldquo;120K for Bizspark Plus&rdquo;, &ldquo;A360K&rdquo;, &ldquo;120K FY16 EXT&rdquo;, &ldquo;360K/500K_Exceptions&rdquo;, etc. All under the same PC Code: P10017854, PFAM: 32F</p>

	<p>Academic Account: many different program names</p>

	</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><em><strong>Note</strong>: </em>BizSpark Plus and Microsoft for Startups sponsorships are not eligible for renewals.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1">However, there are&nbsp;exceptions to these offers when it comes to short term extensions or small increases in monetary credits.</p>

<p class="indent-1">Extensions or increases can be offered on an exception basis for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">SLA credit for service interruptions.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Erroneous sponsorship cancellations when customer still had credits or time remaining.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Business decision to help bridge customer to a paid offer.&#8203;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> -143P is another version if the -36P. The difference is noted below:<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Global Sponsorship offers</h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li>36P &ndash; requires cc</li>
	<li>143P &ndash; does not require cc<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Fairfax Sponsorship offers</h4>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li>36P &ndash; requires cc</li>
	<li>143P &ndash; does not require cc<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>ASMS engineers can now convert customers using offers -0003P or -0064P to -0036P, under these conditions:</p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
<ul>
	<li>The case was sent to us by the BG (showing they automatically approve the conversion)</li>
	<li>The user already has a -0036P running in their account (as all -0036P&#39;s in the account will pull from the same sponsorship).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Sponsorship Renewals&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><span>The </span>type of Sponsorship a customer has will determine <span>the </span>renewal process. ASMS CM is working to define the processes for each Sponsorship type (see Message Center Post <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ASMS_Runtime_Operations/Lists/Process%20Changes%20%20Message%20Center/DispForm.aspx?ID=94" managed-link="" target="_blank"><span>here</span></a>&nbsp;for more details).</p>

<p class="CxSpMiddle">All customers requesting a renewal should be guided to reach out to the Microsoft sponsor/contact that granted them the Sponsorship. That sponsor/contact should provide them further guidance on renewing.</p>

<p class="CxSpMiddle">In this scenario, you should keep the case open.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Continue to follow up with the customer until they have confirmed that they have contacted their sponsor.</li>
	<li>Do not try to persuade or suggest temporary case closure to the customer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> <span>This is a change from previous guidance which required Sponsorship cases to be transferred </span> to the Sponsorship escalation team. <span>We have since learned that that team is </span>not authorized or empowered to perform sponsorship renewal or extensions.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Monthly Statements</strong></p>

<p>Azure Business Operations have decided not to send statements for Sponsorship customers after May 2018, as the sponsorship portal provides usage data that&rsquo;s close to real time (refreshes every 15 minutes) and most of the customers prefer just the usage data. ASMS still may receive SRs from customers requesting for the statements, if you do, please communicate this to the customers:</p>

<p><em>As you know, during your free Microsoft Azure sponsorship we provide continually-updated usage and charges on the Microsoft Azure Sponsorship site. This makes it very convenient to check your usage at any time. Since the site was introduced, we have found that most sponsorship participants prefer using the site to receiving a monthly informational statement. Because of this, we have discontinued sending the monthly statement and we encourage you to refer to the sponsorship site at any time for fresh information.</em></p>

<h4>Routing a case or problem</h4>

<p>There are various programs&nbsp;that customers get sponsorship benefits and for any escalations related to Sponsorships allocated from the following programs you&nbsp;will need to send the problems to the queue - <strong>BizSpark and Startup (Escalations)</strong></p>

<p class="indent-1">&bull; 120K for Bizspark Plus<br>
&bull; A360K<br>
&bull; 120K FY16 EXT<br>
&bull; 360K/500K_Exceptions</p>

<div>If ASMS receives a case for any of the following scenarios&nbsp;and the Sponsorship is granted as part of any of the above mentioned programs&nbsp;you will send the&nbsp;SR/Problem to the queue - <strong>BizSpark and Startup (Escalations</strong>) instead of the <strong>Azure Sponsorship escalations</strong> queue.</div>

<div class="indent-1"><br>
1. AIRS registration updates.<br>
2. Registration questions.<br>
3. Microsoft Accelerator Program: This program is essentially a variant of the BizSpark $120K credit, the start-up must apply and be accepted into the program. This credit is administered as a sponsorship credit.<br>
4. Credit/Refund requests on AIRS/Sponsorship offers<br>
5. SOT of Sponsorship<br>
6. Moving Sponsorship entitlements to a different account</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Subscription Ownership Transfer (SOT)</strong></div>

<div>For SOT request,&nbsp;follow the eligibility checks and approval requirements as per <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3040383" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 3040383</a>.&nbsp;<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Entitlement Transfers</strong></div>

<div>Customers may request to transfer their entitlement from one account to another. In these instances, do the following before engaging your TA/PTA for assistance:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Obtain approval from both the Source and Destination account owners.&nbsp;</strong></li>
	<li><strong><span><span>Determine if adding an O<em>wner</em> RBAC role to the Destination subscription will resolve the customers&rsquo; ask. </span></span></strong>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span>In most cases, customers ask for a transfer the subscription in an effort to grant the Destination account access to the sponsored sub. However, adding an <em>Owner</em> RBAC role to the Destination may resolve the access need. </span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>If this is not an option for the customer proceed to the next step. </span></span></li>
	</ul>

<h3><strong>Azure CSP Sponsorship</strong></h3>

<p>Azure CSP Sponsorship, also known as Azure Access CSP Proof of Concept (PoC), provides Azure credit to end customers&rsquo; subscriptions created in CSP.</p>

<p>Microsoft pays for the subscription consumption instead of the partner, during the PoC period. The upcoming charges are then automatically reverted back to the CSP partner to continue the process of executing the sales cycle, by moving from PoC to production environment.</p>

<p>Azure Access CSP PoC is ideal for opportunities where a customer needs a partner to provide managed service for their Azure solution. The partner provisions an Azure CSP subscription to run the PoC; the same subscription can be used as the production environment once the PoC ends.</p>

<p>The Azure CSP Sponsorship offer is similar to a standard -36P offer, however only the CSP partner can inform end customers of details such as their remaining credit.</p>

<p>For more information about CSP Sponsorship, see the following links (<strong>Internal Only</strong>):</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">

</ul>

<div><strong>How can&nbsp;you identify&nbsp;the program that the sponsorship has been granted under:</strong></div>

<div class="indent-1"><br>
&bull; Go to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="aka.ms/airs" managed-link="" target="_blank">the AIRS site.</a><br>
&bull; Click on Sign in<br>
&bull; Click on List Registrations<br>
&bull; Uncheck box &ldquo;Pending business desk approval&rdquo;<br>
&bull; Under Account owner Live id &ndash; enter the Email on which sponsorship was granted and check &ldquo;Equals&rdquo; box.<br>
&bull; Click on Filter and click on the tab under &ldquo;#&rdquo; symbol<br>
&bull; Scroll down to section which talks about &ldquo;Cross Charge Information&rdquo; you will see the Tab (In this section if you see any of the above mentioned program names and requires escalations to Enterprise Azure Operations, please route the SR/problem based on the scenario to &quot;BizSpark and Startup (Escalations)<br>
&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong>How to Validate Subscription Sponsorship Registration:</strong><br>
You can use <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="aka.ms/airs" managed-link="" target="_blank">AIRS</a> to check if a subscription from an account is or is not properly registered against the sponsorship database on that account by&nbsp;following the steps below:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Continue to convert the existing subscriptions as long as a 36p exists under the account.</li>
	<li>Access <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="aka.ms/airs" managed-link="" target="_blank">AIRS</a> and validate whether the converted subscription is on the list:</li>
</ol>

<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>If AIRS lists the subscription, proceed with the case without engaging the Sponsorship team</li>
	<li>If AIRS does not list the subscription, engage the Sponsorship team through a problem, so they can fix the subscription and have it properly listed in the Sponsorship database.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Escalation Path:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>For Partner related issues, enage the CSP Team as outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/3078989" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG <span class="documentFamilyId ng-binding" ng-bind="article.documentFamilyId">3078989</span></a>.</li>
	<li>For CSP Sponsorship billing issues, engage the Azure Sponsorship Offer queue.&nbsp;</li>

<p>&nbsp;Please reach out to your TA if you have confusion on sending cases/problems to Azure Sponsorship Offer queue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>If a 143p (academic offer) is suspended by the Sponsorship team despite an active AIRS registration and remaining credits, ASMS can assist directly instead of engaging the Sponsorship team. </strong></p>

<p>As this is an academic account, the account owner sets monetary caps and ends per subscription, so:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Have customer go to <a href="https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/manage" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/manage</a> so that they can set a new end date and monetary cap for this subscription to allow for it to be reactivated in CMAT.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>It is strongly advised that you do this over the phone to ensure the reactivation within the 1 hour timeframe.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Always have the customer do this within an hour of reactivation as auto-suspension may occur again if they don&#39;t update the end date on the Academic Portal.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>ASMS can reactivate subscriptions after the above steps.</p>
	</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>SOT Request or Offer Conversions to Azure Sponsorship Subscription</strong></p>

<p>You may receive a case requesting a SOT from MSA to Org (or Org to MSA) where the Email ID is the same.</p>

<p>&bull; ASMS should check in AIRS with the email ID first to see if there is a valid/active entitlement.<br>
&bull; ASMS Should not be performing SOT (or conversions to sponsorship) prior to validating if the Entitlement is on MSA or Org PUID.<br>
&bull; ASMS should confirm with Sponsorship team if Entitlement is on MSA or Org PUID by sending a collaboration task with all details filled, such as AIRS registration# (Get this from AIRS portal), Current AA ID , Subscription GUID etc.<br>
&bull; After receiving confirmation from Azure Sponsorship escalation team proceed with SOT or conversion of offers.</p>

<h4><strong>The following is for your information</strong></h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Customer facing FAQ - </strong><a href="https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/">https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/</a></p>

<p><strong>What is a Sponsored Account?</strong><br>
Microsoft can &#39;sponsor&#39; an account so that an outside user / company can use Azure services with the billing being charged back to Microsoft.&nbsp; This allows Microsoft to set the duration of the offer, and the dollar amount of credit the user has to spend. All usage will come out of the AIRS system, they will not get a standard PDF like standard MOSP users. When the account is set up for Sponsorship, the&nbsp;Azure BG inputs the following properties for the Sponsorship:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Start Date of the sponsorship</li>
	<li>End Date of the sponsorship</li>
	<li>Total monetary credit of the Sponsorship amount</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the sponsorship is activated, the customer will be able to run one or more -0036P subscriptions inside of the account.&nbsp;&nbsp;All 0036P subscriptions will pull from the same monetary credit amount and will all have the same start&nbsp;and end dates. For example of the sponsorship is for a total of&nbsp;$10,000.00 USD, all of the 0036P subscriptions in the account will draw from the same&nbsp;$10,000.00 credit. Each subscriptions <strong>will not</strong> have its own $10,000.00 monetary credit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sponsorship subscriptions will end in one of three ways:</p>

<p>1) The end date of the sponsorship is reached.&nbsp; The subscriptions will automatically be converted into a PayG subscription at that time. Any remaining monetary credit from the sponsorship expires and&nbsp;<strong>does not</strong> carry forward and is not available for a refund.</p>

<p>2) The total monetary credit of the sponsorship is exhausted. The subscriptions will automatically be converted into a PayG subscription at that time.</p>

<p>3) The Azure account is converted to EA. The subscriptions will automatically be converted&nbsp;to EA&nbsp;subscriptions at that time. Any remaining monetary credit from the sponsorship expires and&nbsp;<strong>does not</strong> carry forward and is not available to be added into the customer EA agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Pay Instruments</strong><br>
All sponsored accounts need a PI.&nbsp; It is OK for users on this offer to be approved for the invoice option (if they request it), you must still follow standard process and get Global Financial Services (GFS) approval first.&nbsp; That won&#39;t get billed on the invoice until the duration is up or the credit is used up, whichever comes first. Invoice whitelisting DOES NOT need approval from the BG, just follow standard Invoice whitelisting procedures. For urgent Invoice PI approvals for 0036P customers, engage your TA.</p>

<p><strong>Initiation of a Sponsored Account</strong><br>
If we get a request to set up a user with a sponsored account ( 0036P ), the process is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>ASMS sends the BG the following info:
	<ul>
		<li>WLID/ORGID of Azure account to be sponsored</li>
		<li>PC code of the internal MSFT group who is &lsquo;paying&rsquo; for the sponsorship (groups cross charge info)</li>
		<li>Start and end dates of the sponsorship (may need to discuss this with both customer and BG to get approval/on same page)</li>
		<li>Total Credit amount available via the Sponsorship</li>
		<li>Budget approver alias (e.g. KimL)</li>
		<li>Any additional customer emails that the customer wants to receive the monthly Sponsorship usage emails (in addition to the account WLID, these will be generated out of the AIRS system)</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The BG inputs the info into AIRS to finalize the sponsorship</li>
	<li>The BG confirms with ASMS that sponsorship is setup</li>
	<li>ASMS converts the customer&rsquo;s existing sub to -0036P or instructs customer to sign up for a new -0036P in their portal</li>
</ul>

<p>NOTE: This sponsorship is ACCOUNT based, so if there are&nbsp;more than one&nbsp;0036P subs in a Sponsored account they will all be tied into the same sponsorship start and end dates and will all &lsquo;pull&rsquo; from the same credit pool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Activation and Conversions</h3>

<h4><strong>Activations</strong></h4>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal" type="1">
	<li>Please have the customer provision a sponsorship subscription by clicking on one of the below links depending on their account type:
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" type="a">
		<li>Work/School ID: <a href="https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0036p&amp;WHR=azure.com">https://account.azure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0036p&amp;WHR=azure.com</a></li>
		<li>Microsoft ID: <a href="https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0036p">https://account.azure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0036p</a></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If the customer receives the&nbsp;error &ldquo;Oops! Microsoft Azure Sponsorship is not available&rdquo; it is because the Account Type that the customer logged in with is incorrect. They must log in with the other account type. For example, if the customer logs in with their Microsoft ID, and receives the below message, then they need to log in with their Org ID in order to provision the Sponsorship subscription.</li>
	<li>If the customer still has issues in provisioining their Sponsorship subscription, please send a problem with the Account ID to the Azure&nbsp;Sponsorship Offer queue&nbsp;to verify if the account ID is entitled to the Sponsorship offer. If not, then ask to help to find out which one it is.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Conversions</strong></h4>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal" type="1">
	<li>Please ask the customer for their approval letter to the program so that you can verify that they are on the sponsorship program.</li>
	<li>Create a&nbsp;problem to the&nbsp;Azure Sponsorship Offer&nbsp; team to verify if the account the customer provided is on the Sponsorship program and have them specify which account type as well (Work/School or Microsoft Account).</li>
	<li>Once it is verified that the account type (Work/School or Microsoft Account) and account ID matches in AIRS, then proceed with the conversion. If the sub is not on the same account type as in AIRS (i.e. AIRS entitled their Microsoft Account and customer is logged in with their Work account), then ask the customer if you can move the sub to their other account (i.e. Microsoft Account). If the customer does not want to move the sub to their other account type, then create a&nbsp;problem with&nbsp;Azure Sponsorship Offer&nbsp; to change the entitlement to their other account type (i.e. Work Account).
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" type="a">
		<li>Example:</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol class="indent-2">
	<li>michael@contoso.com is a Work account</li>
	<li>michael@contoso.com is entitled in AIRS as a Microsoft Account</li>
	<li>Customer wants to convert their PAYG sub on their Work Account to the sponsorship offer</li>
	<li>Create&nbsp;problem to&nbsp;Azure Sponsorship Offer&nbsp; to verify what account type the customer&rsquo;s sponsorship is on (Work or Microsoft)</li>
	<li>Azure Sponsorship Offer&nbsp;&nbsp;states that the customer is entitled to their Microsoft Account</li>
	<li>Ask customer if you can move their PAYG to their Microsoft Account
	<ol>
		<li>If the customer says yes, transfer and convert to 36P</li>
		<li>If the customer says no, create a&nbsp;problem to&nbsp;Azure Sponsorship Offer&nbsp; to move entitlement to their Work account</li>
		<li>Once&nbsp;Azure Sponsorship Offer&nbsp;entitles the Work account, then convert the sub to 36P</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Before converting the customer&rsquo;s subscription to the Sponsorship offer, go to <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/" managed-link="">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/regions/offers/ </a>and verify the customer&#39; existing subscription does not have regions that are unavailable under the Sponsorship offer and inform the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Example: </strong>Customer has a PAYG with VM&#39;s deployed under West US.&nbsp; West US is not one of the regions available under the Sponsorship offer and so the customer will not be able to continue deploying new VMs under the West US Region.</p>

<p><strong>Converting EA Subscriptions (017P) to EA Sponsorship&nbsp;(136P)</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>If the customer has received a Sponsorship Invite, they can go to the Sponsorship portal and convert the subscriptions to 136P themselves by clicking the <strong>Pen</strong> (Edit) icon in the top-right of the screen.</li>
	<li>After clicking the icon, check the boxes of the subs you wish to convert to EA Sponsorship.</li>
	<li>
	<p>After checking the boxes of all the subscriptions that you want to be part of the EA Sponsorship, click &ldquo;<strong>Save</strong>&rdquo;.</p>

<p><u><span lang="en-US">How to activate the </span><span lang="fr">Sponsorship Offer for MPN:</span></u></p>

<p lang="fr">Partners can find it on the download portal. (<a href="http://aka.ms/ActivateIUR">http://aka.ms/ActivateIUR</a>)</p>

<p>Look for &ldquo;Microsoft Azure Bulk Credit&rdquo; product name.</p>

<ul>
	<li>There are a lot of questions around MPN signups and not being able to activate their Azure credits to their account.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some first steps&nbsp;to help the customer:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Please request the MPN ID from the customer and send a&nbsp;Problem to Azure&nbsp;Sponsorship Offer queue&nbsp;to see if the MPN ID is already registered in our system.&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>If the MPN ID is already registered in the system, Azdesk will send a note back saying that the customer will need to talk to the Primary Program Contact from their organization to see if the MPN ID transferred to the new account ID.</li>
		<li>If the MPN ID is not already registered in the system, have the customer follow the below steps:&nbsp;</li>
		<li>Have the customer associate their account ID to the organization&rsquo;s MPN ID by going to this link <a href="https://partners.microsoft.com/PartnerProgram">https://partners.microsoft.com/PartnerProgram</a> logging in with their Live ID. This person will be taken to the association workflow from there and can request the association which the administrators of the org can approve on PMC (program Management Center).</li>
		<li>Partners log in to partner digital download portal (<a href="http://aka.ms/ActivateIUR)">http://aka.ms/ActivateIUR)</a></li>
		<li>Click at &ldquo;Microsoft Online Services&rdquo;</li>
		<li><strong>Note:</strong> A Microsoft account associated with administrator access is required.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>To ensure that everything is setup properly, the customer should receive the above approval in the MPN portal AND an email saying that their sponsorship has been created.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Please request the customer to send over the EMAIL confirmation to ensure that everything is set up accordingly.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>&nbsp;Some other questions a customer may ask:</u></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. I am on a sponsorship, why does the Azure Accounts portal show $0 balance?</p>

<p>a. The Azure Accounts portal will not show your sponsorship balance, as this is a $0 offer.&nbsp; Basically you are offered a 100% discount to all services on your account for the duration of your sponsorship, therefore the balance will show $0.&nbsp; To find the balance on your account, please sign in with your account details here: <a href="https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/balance">https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/balance</a></p>

<p>2. Can I move my sponsorship subscription to another account?</p>

<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the destination account is registered as a sponsored account, then yes &agrave; please confirm with azdesk to ensure that the destination account is in AIRS</p>

<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the destination account is not in AIRS, then contact azdesk to get this created.</p>

<blockquote dir="ltr">
<p>&nbsp; Can I&nbsp;purchase third party products (VSO, Marketplace, etc..) with&nbsp;my sponsorship subscription?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, but they will be billed to the credit card on file separately, you cannot use your sponsorship credits on third party purchases.</p>

<p>3. Can&nbsp;the Customer access the usage logging into <a href="https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/Usage" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://www.microsoftazuresponsorships.com/Usage</a> using the Account administrator&#39;s Email address?</p>

<p>a. Yes. &gt; Click on usage in the Top Tab &gt; Select the date range &gt; Download.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The Account Administrator is the only user with access to the usage portal.</p>

<p>Cloud Platform competency refresh (36p Offer)</p>

<p>(Retirement of 27p &amp; 28p&nbsp; offers)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Historically, Microsoft offered a $250 (silver) and $500 (gold) monthly credit to partners enrolled in the Cloud Platform competency.&nbsp; After the September 26, 2015 PVP update, partners will see an annual credit (also known as a bulk credit) of $6,000 USD for silver partners and $12,000 USD for gold partners.&nbsp; &nbsp;Partners can consume the annual credit by accessing the link for the credit in the PDD, just as they consumed the monthly credit.&nbsp; Although the credit is available as an annual credit, partners may consume the credit as they like, for instance all in one day or in smaller amounts spread out over their competency enrollment period.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can find more information about 27p &amp; 28p offers here: <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/Cloud%20Platform%20competency%20refresh%20(36p%20Offer).docx">https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/</a>Cloud%20Platform%20competency%20refresh%20(36p%20Offer).docx</p>
