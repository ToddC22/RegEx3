For full SharePoint functionality and support, you must have the February 2014 cumulative update (CU) or a later CU installed. Additionally, only a new&#160;SharePoint Server 2010 SP2 slipstream installation that has the February 2014 CU or a later CU installed is supported on Windows Server 2012 R2. Microsoft does not support a Windows in-place upgrade for this scenario.<br><br></div><div class='kb-moreinformation-section section'>When you try to install a pre-SP2 version of SharePoint Server 2010 on a computer that&#39;s running Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2, you may experience one or more of the following issues.&#160;<h3 class='sbody-h3'>Issue 1 </h3>The SharePoint Server 2010 installation process fails.&#160;<h3 class='sbody-h3'>Issue 2</h3>The SharePoint Server 2010 prerequisite installer (PrerequisiteInstaller.exe) fails, and you receive the following error message:<div class='sbody-error'>This program has compatibility issues<br><br></div><img class="graphic" src="/Library/Images/2741352.png" alt="" title=""><br><br><span class='text-base'>Note </span>When you click <span class='text-base'>Run the program without getting help</span>&#160;to install SharePoint Server 2010, you may receive an error message that resembles the following:<div class='sbody-error'>| Verifying if SharePoint can be installed |<br>SharePoint Server 2010 cannot be installed on Windows Server 2012.<br>Completed SharePointCanInstall: Error<br>-----------------------------------------------------</div><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Issue 3</h3>When you try to start the SharePoint 2010 Management Shell, you receive the following error message:<div class='sbody-error'>The Local farm is not accessible.
