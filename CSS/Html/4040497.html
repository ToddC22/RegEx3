<h3>How can a customer have a different Xbox date of birth and a different Microsoft account date of birth?</h3>

<p>There are two records of date of birth; one maintained by Microsoft account and one by Xbox Live. When a customer creates an Xbox Live profile, Xbox Live uses the customer&rsquo;s Microsoft account date of birth and records that as the Xbox Live date of birth.</p>

<h3>What happens if a customer changes the&nbsp;date of birth in the Microsoft account?</h3>

<p>Customers can change the Microsoft account date of birth, but that will not update the Xbox Live date of birth. If those two dates are different the Xbox experience will not reflect the updated Microsoft account date of birth so the customer will have issues for those scenarios that are still checking the Xbox Live date of birth.</p>

<p>Customers will sometimes update their Microsoft account&nbsp;date of birth thinking this will remove them from a child role in a family or remove parental settings. Changing the date of birth does not change the role a customer has in a family, and it will not remove any parental restrictions. Only action by a parent in the family can remove someone from a child role in a family or change family settings.</p>

Can the Xbox Live date of birth be changed?</h3>

<p>There is no way to update the Xbox Live date of birth, but depending on the customer&rsquo;s scenario there are solutions. See below for specific troubleshooting steps.</p>

<h3>What should I do if MST indicates the customer has different dates of birth?</h3>

<p>&ldquo;You need a parent&rsquo;s permission&rdquo; when signing into Xbox Live - If the customer receives this error message but says they have changed their Microsoft account age to an adult, the Xbox date of birth is listed as a child. Since the Xbox Live age cannot be changed, the customer will need to be in a child role in a Microsoft family to sign into Xbox Live.</p>

<p>Error indicating your account type is not allowed &ndash; this can happen when trying to access some features that are managed by Xbox Live privacy and online safety settings, or features of Xbox Live such as custom gamer pic. Privacy or safety settings issues can be resolved by having the customer be added as a child role in a Microsoft family so a parent can manage/change the settings as needed. For issues with accessing features such as custom gamer pic, the customer will have to wait until his Xbox Live age makes him an adult.</p>

<h3>When should I escalate?</h3>

<p>Do not escalate any of these scenarios to Tier 3. If the troubleshooting steps above to not resolve the customers issue, then reach out to a TA or Ranger for additional troubleshooting and resolution.</p>
