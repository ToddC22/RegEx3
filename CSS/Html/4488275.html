<strong>Account Clean UP</strong> - the process, done in one or multiple phases, that erases the connection made upon migrating from Partner Membership Center (PMC) to Partner (Center) Dashboard, between the MPN Membership of a Partner with an AAD tenant that the Partner considers as being incorrect, and that enables the Partner to re-migrate and re-associate his MPN membership with the tenant the Partner considers as being correct.&nbsp;The process also applies to new MPN accounts created in Partner Center or to CSP accounts.</p>

<h4><a id="3" name="3"></a>3.1 Scenarios for cleanup</h4>

<p>Both frontline support and Partners can notice that the account/tenant used for migration from Partner Membership Center (PMC) to Partner Center is incorrect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1)&nbsp;Partner used a wrong tenant to setup Partner Center Account. Here are reasons for that:</p>

<p class="indent-1">a. They ended up creating a new tenant and later realized they had an AAD identity in an existing tenant.</p>

<p class="indent-1">b. They were logged in with some other AAD identity and ended up using that. Later realized that it was not their corporate identity they want to setup PC account with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) Partner was managing multiple V-orgs and ended up migrating a V-org from PMC using AAD tenant of an organization which was not owner of V-org. In this case, user is working with multiple companies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>3) Partner ended up enrolling as a net new partner and now wants to migrate their existing organization from PMC using same tenant.</p>

<h4><a id="32" name="32"></a>3.2&nbsp;Frontline support call to action<span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span>Frontline support should first check <span><span><span><span><span>that the cleanup request comes from the Global Admin on the tenant. In order to check this, search in CMAT with the tenant and see if the user has Company Administrator role. Note there may be multiple admins; any one of them can request the cleanup. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Then check if there is an active enrollment (subscription) on the account or not in Prose:</span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>a) I</span></span></span><span><span><span>f there is an existing active enrollment (subscription) on the account (visible in Prose), frontline support should check to see </span></span></span><strong><span><span><span>if Anniversary Date is less than 3 months in the future</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> - they should advise Partner to wait until their anniversary date and afterwards for the cleanup to be performed. In this way, Partner will experience uninterrupted access to his benefits management and account. If the cleanup would be performed now, Partner would lose temporarily the access to the management of his account.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>b) I</span></span><span><span>f there is an existing active enrollment (subscription) on the account (visible in Prose), frontline support should check to see </span></span><strong><span><span>if Anniversary Date is more than 3 months in the future</span></span></strong><span><span> - <strong>Partner should be set with the correct expectations that the cleanup procedure can take around 1.5 weeks average, depending on the complexity of his account</strong>. </span></span></p>

<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-24">
<p>If purchase is visible in the Offline PI tool, then the request for benefit and enrollment cancellation should be escalated as per escalation path in VKB article 4134503 (if payment was made by Partner via Wire Transfer) or as per escalation path in VKB article 4340330 (if payment was made by Partner via Credit Card) prior to escalating to MPN Global Support for the cleanup itself.</p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span>Any account cleanup request with an active enrollment on the account and with an order that is not visible in Offline PI tool should be escalated to MPN Global Support, using the recommended template from </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2865698" managed-link="" target="_blank">VKB article 2865698</a></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>While the account cleanup is being done, Partner will, in phases: </span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>- lose access to benefit management from Partner Center;</span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>- have his MPN enrollment (subscription) de-activated from Partner Center;</span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>- not be able to access the account altogether until the re-migration occurs. </span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>After the account cleanup procedure is completed, Partner will receive a new link that he should use to migrate to his tenant/account of choice in Partner Center.

<p class="x"><strong><span><span><span>For frontline support awareness only (no action to be taken):</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p class="x"><strong><span><span><span>When there is an existing active enrollment (subscription) on the account</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>, the account cleanup procedure is split between three engineering teams that perform the following phases of the account cleanup:</span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>1) Deactivation of enrollment (active enrollment /subscription status is set to status DENIED/CLOSED in the system and will reflect as such in PrOSE).</span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>2) Decommissioning of benefits (all benefits from the account are disassociated from the tenant that is being cleaned up).</span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>3) PMC dates are being reset (the new anniversary date obtained in the moment of enrollment purchase, will be changed in the backend to reflect the previous Anniversary date that the Partner had) &ndash; applicable only for purchases made in PC.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><span><span><span>4) Account cleanup (in this last phase, the last disassociations between the MPN account and the tenant are being performed. In this very last phase, MPN Global Support will perform the account cleanup.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="x"><strong><span><span><span>If there is NO existing active enrollment (subscription) on the account</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>, frontline support should set correct expectations with Partner that account cleanup procedure can take around 3 business days to be completed and that at some point in this timeframe, he will not be able to access the account in Partner Center until the re-migration occurs. After the account cleanup procedure is completed, Partner will receive a new link that he should use to migrate to his tenant/account of choice in Partner Center. Partner should perform the re-migration in an InPrivate browser window, making sure that his user has Global Admin credentials. </span></span></span><span><span><span>In this case, MPN Global Support will perform the account cleanup.</span></span></span></p>

<h4 class="x"><a id="33" name="33"></a>3.3&nbsp;MPN Global Support call to action</h4>

<p><span><span>In this exact order and only by following the &ldquo;Mandatory step?&rdquo; action checks, MPN Global Support team should ensure that all pre-requisite steps of an account cleanup are performed before the cleanup itself is executed in Prose. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><a id="4" name="4"></a>Partners can also request to clean up their CSP accounts for various reasons, see below common scenarios: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>They enrolled on the wrong tenant and they want to enroll on a different one.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>They want to use that tenant for multi tenancy on an MPN account and this is not possible if the tenant is already in use.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>They already have a CSP account on a different tenant and have applied again by mistake.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The CSP account is no longer needed and they want to clean it up so that the tenant is free of any enrollments.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you receive CSP clean up requests, please escalate all cases following escalation template in&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2865698" managed-link="" target="_blank">article 2865698</a>, to MPN Global Support.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Necessary checks before escalating: </span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Check if the user requesting the cleanup is a<strong> </strong>Global Admin on the tenant. In order to verify this, search in CMAT with the tenant and see if the user has Company Administrator role. Note there may be multiple admins; any one of them can request the cleanup. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the CSP account is in &ldquo;<strong>Active</strong>&rdquo; state, inform the partner that they will lose anything related to the CSP and they will need to start over if they still require a CSP account. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the CSP account has a &ldquo;<strong>Suspended</strong>&rdquo; status, this means they were offboarded and we need to check the reason with the Offboarding and Remediation Intake team. Escalate the clean-up cases to MPNGS team who will reach out to them. If the Offboarding team approve the clean-up they will re-instate the account and change the status to &ldquo;Active&rdquo;. Only then the clean-up can be done. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Through the <strong>Offboarding </strong>process the CSP account remains in Partner Center/Prose under the &quot;Suspended&quot; status and the partner will not be able to use the tenant for anything. Request the offboarding only if the partner does not wish to use the tenant for anything in the future.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Account Clean-up</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> does not prevent re-enrollment. Clean-up is basically removing the AAD tenant association with the Partner Center account. It was intended for scenarios where the partner migrated with the wrong identity &ndash; the cleanup removes that association and they can use the tenant to migrate/enroll again.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>You can see more details on the Offboarding process in the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4476181" managed-link="" target="_blank">Partner Center Offboarding</a> article. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the CSP account has a &ldquo;<strong>Declined</strong>&rdquo; status, in most cases they have failed the vetting process. This means that they have not yet signed a contract, however we need to check with OneVet team the reason the partner failed the vetting. The MPNGS team will reach out to them. Depending on the reason and if they approve, we can then proceed with the clean-up. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>REQUIREMENT</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Please ask the partner to provide a written confirmation for the CSP clean-up, regardless of the status on the account (active, suspended, declined etc.). </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You may encounter less common scenarios and you can escalate those for cleanup as well. The MPN Global Support team will review each case and provide additional guidance if needed.</span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span><a id="5" name="5"></a></span></span></span></span></span></strong>Basically, this feature combines scenarios A.&amp;B. from <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4498851/partner-center-multiple-vorgs-with-single-tenant-migration-vorg-consol" managed-link="" target="_blank">article 4498851&nbsp;Multiple VOrgs with Single Tenant Migration (VOrg Consolidation)</a>.</p>

<p>Note: The Partner Global Account - PGA is the first account to be migrated. All the other ones will land as Partner Location Account &ndash; PLA under the PGA.</p>

<p><strong>Scenarios</strong></p>

<p>For all below scenarios, please gather from partner a Business Justification Letter where he motivates why he is requesting a de-consolidation.</p>

<p class="indent-1">A. If all the V-orgs were migrated from PMC</p>

<p>In this case the clean-up will be done on all the accounts and the re-migration link will be provided. After deciding which account will be the PGA, the partner will firstly migrate it and then, after the migration is successful, all the others will proceed to re-migrate according to their business needs.</p>

<p class="indent-1">&nbsp;B. If one of the V-orgs is created in PC (NetNew)</p>

<p>Then the partner should be informed that once NetNew V-orgs are cleaned up, they cannot re-migrate so the partner needs to re-enroll. In this case the partner either choses the NetNew V-org as PGA (so it will not be cleaned up) or&nbsp;choses another PMC generated V-org as PGA so the NetNew will be cleaned up and the partner will need to&nbsp; re-enroll and then consolidate.</p>

<p>Note: <strong>Check if Net-New has a CSP footprint</strong> by searching in PROSE with all the NetNew MPN IDs an account type equal to <strong><em>&ldquo;Tenant&rdquo;</em></strong></p>

<p>If CSP Footprint found:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Confirm with partner if he is ready to clean up CSP account also (e.g. if CSP account is declined, pending qualification or the partner does not use it).</li>
	<li>Gather written confirmation from the partner that CSP enrollment can be also cleaned up.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><a id="6" name="6"></a></span></span><strong>6.1. Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Please advise the Partner that there is absolutely no impact for his company account in the current form. Also, please provide following documentation to Partner for him to get familiarized with:</p>

<p>- <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/account-structure" managed-link="" target="_blank">the account structure in PC</a></p>

<p>- <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/move-pmc-pc-map" managed-link="" target="_blank">differences between PMC and PC</a></p>

<p>Please present the partner the benefits of this feature as presented in sub-section 2 below.</p>

<p><strong>6.2. Benefits of V-org consolidation</strong></p>

<p>Firstly we need to set up the expectations with the partners and let them know that this feature was implemented&nbsp; for them to manage multiple V-orgs for their company and to consolidate them into their single Partner Center account.</p>

<p>Based on our experiences, some partners chose to consolidate all their accounts for ease of access as well as attainment of competencies, partner management understanding the fact that they might see a decrease in IURs. Hence for these partners, they chose to go through the route of&nbsp; purchasing their other licenses through Commercial Licensing as they will have better control of what specific licenses they utilize within their organization as well as control over the numbers of licenses they need for each user within their organization.</p>

<p><strong>Why consolidate?</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>You will find it easier to manage MPN, Cosell, solution publishing under one account structure.</li>
	<li>You will need to pay for competencies and MAPS one time.</li>
	<li>You will have consolidated reporting for earnings and payments. No need to log on to separate v-org accounts for full picture.</li>
	<li>You may be eligible for more competencies after consolidating other accounts.</li>
	<li>If you become eligible for more competencies you can gain eligibility to incentive programs you were not previously eligible for.</li>
	<li>If you consolidate with an existing active enrollment (Active SILVER, GOLD), One year Extension offers are unlocked post Consolidation which makes up for the Benefits you enjoyed in PMC as individual organizations, for an additional year to help you plan moving forward.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important Note: </strong>please inform the partner that this process is a very complex one and it may take up to several weeks to be completed. They might not be able to use their benefits while we are doing the deconsolidation.</p>

<p><strong>6.3. Frontline support call to action:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Present the partner the benefits of the V-org consolidation feature and all the helpful public articles.</li>
	<li>Ask the partner to provide the reason and the Business Justification Letter.</li>
	<li>Check the purchases of the consolidated accounts and present and set the expectations to the partner according to the refund policy.</li>
	<li>Additionally, as the V-org de-consolidation process involves an account clean up the impact on the partner side will also be the one from general account clean up:</li>
</ul>

<p>1.) Any cloud products and on-prem (software) activated tokens will continue to run until their expiry date.</p>

<p>2.) Any user assignment subscriptions for the account will be disabled (Azure Bulk Credit / Azure monthly credit / Visual Studio Subscription / Technical Benefits &ndash; Advisory hours / Products support -, Go-to-market).</p>

<p>3.) Any benefit not consumed will be deprovisioned.</p>

<p>4.) Gold enrollment will be disabled.</p>

<p>5.) Any MCP associated in the old PMC platform, will still show up after the re-migration is completed.</p>

<p>6.) Any MCP associated only on Partner Center will need to re-associate themselves after the re-migration is completed under</p>

<ul>
	<li>Make the partner aware of the fact that this is a complex process and they may not be able to access their inactivated benefits in this time as per rules outlined in above bullet point.</li>
	<li>After above process has been performed and all the necessary documents have been gathered, please escalated accordingly to MPN Global Support queue by following the steps outlined in<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2865698" target="_blank" title="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2865698">&nbsp;article 2865698</a>.</li>
