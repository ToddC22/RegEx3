<h3>Overview</h3>

<p><span>Modern Commerce - <strong>Customer Led</strong> is the second major phase (after Field Led) of the Modern Commerce Platform rollout. This phase is broken down into Milestones. Milestone 1 was targeted at net-new Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) subscription sign ups and Free Trial to PAYG conversions. Milestone 2 primarily expands the number of countries in which the rollout is available.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In Modern, customers can access Azure either through an Azure Plan or an Azure Plan for Dev/Test. Each plan contains the specific pricing and billing that is appropriate for its customers. Some customers are eligible for both types of Azure Plans, while other are only eligible for one. Additionally, customers&rsquo; experience can </span><span>be different if they are signing up as an individual or as member of a larger organization or corporation.</span></p>

<p><span>These customers are supported in the same way current Field Led Modern customers are supported using CST.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4>Background</h4>

<p><span>Legacy program had many solution-based offers (e.g. compute pre-purchase, OMS suites, SAP Hana, StorSimple) that were only available in the EA. The problem this created was that the best deals and most competitive prices were often hidden from the customers on Azure.com. </span></p>

<p><span>Potential customers had little choice to but to conclude Microsoft was less competitive than other public cloud service providers or it forced a disproportionate share of customers transactions in the EA. Potential self-serve customers are stuck in the EA licensing program which is more complex and requires significant operational touches and costs.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>Modern democratized the customer experience across all our Azure channels. This enables Microsoft to funnel new customers into the correct experience. Inside the Azure Portal each customer will have the opportunity adjust her or his experience as needed.&nbsp; </span></p>

<h3>Policy</h3>

<h4>Pricing</h4>

<p>Customers will pay standard PAYG rates. The Field can provide incentives through Quotes (Azure Monetary Credit, etc.) if deemed n<span><span><span>ecessary </span></span></span>, but most customers will be on the standard rating model.</p>

<h4>Offer Limitations</h4>

<p>Only 17G Modern subscriptions are available during this phase. Dev/Test (148G) will be available (tentatively) April 2020.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="RegionLimitations" name="RegionLimitations"></a>Region Limitations</strong></h4>

<p>Modern Commerce Customer Led is available in all countries where Azure is commercially available, but excludes sovereign cloud products in the US Government, Azure&nbsp;China, and Azure&nbsp;Germany&nbsp;regions.</p>

<p>All Azure consumption is priced in USD. There are 95 (USD) currencies supported:</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange Rates (FX Rates) are determined at the end of each month for the following month&#39;s rate. Each invoice is calculated using the FX Rate. Customer invoices show the applied FX Rate each month.</p>

<p>Additional information can be found on the <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/treasury/forex/Pages/default.aspx">FX Rate SharePoint page</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="_Hlk496687128">Customer Experience and Provisioning </a></h3>

<p>The Modern customer experience with Signup, Upgrade and Cost Management + Billing can be seen in the following deck: <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/t/betaazureSM/ERgOa-uZzBpNs0ufzSybIpsBEJu5fVWJ7N8OZbuCQlRE1g?e=0RKbq7">Customer Experience - Current vs. Future</a> (PowerPoint, internal only).</p>

<p><strong>Example</strong></p>

<p><span class="ms-rteFontSize-2">Rashmi currently has a Free Trial and decides to lift the monetary cap on 7/5/19. In Legacy, this would have converted the subscription Offer ID from 044P to 003P; instead, Rashmi&#39;s Offer ID will be converted to 17G. She will then receive a single invoice for all her Azure consumption&nbsp;&#8203;and her Azure Marketplace purchases. She will continue to be immediately billed and invoiced for Reservation purchases.</span></p>

<h4>Invoices</h4>

<p>After a customer has converted their Free Trial subscription to Modern 17G or signs up for a PAYG 17G subscription, they will receive a single invoice for Marketplace and first party purchases.</p>

<h3><a name="_Hlk496687096">Support Scenarios </a></h3>

<h4>Billing Support</h4>

<p>All scenarios that require billing support should be completed using the Commerce Support Tool (CST).</p>

<h4>Quota Increase Experience for ASMS</h4>

<p>Subscriptions will remain as 17G, but for the purposes of customer led quota request will follow the same process as 3P (Pay-As-You-Go) legacy subscriptions.</p>

<p>For guidelines on how to increase quota, refer to the following TSGs:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>
	<p><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2834676">TSG 2834676</a> (Process for Quota Increases (Capacity Management))</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4086154">TSG 4086154</a> (Process for Quota Increases (Non-Capacity Management)).</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: When searching in CMAT or in the Commerce Support Tool (CST), the subscription will show as a 17G. However, when using the ARM endpoint in Jarvis, the subscription will show the Offer ID as 3P.</p>

<h4>Credits and Refunds</h4>

<ul>
	<li>Most refunds and credits can be processed by ASMS using the steps outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4487934" managed-link="">TSG&nbsp;</a><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4487934" managed-link="">4487934</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Pay by Invoice Whitelisting</h4>

<p>Web Direct customers in Modern may still request the Pay by Invoice service. Follow the same process as for Legacy Web Direct, including using CMAT to perform the whitelisting for Pay by Invoice.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Once whitelisted, Modern customers may change their payment instrument (PI) to the Invoice mode of payment using the <strong>Billing Profile</strong> tab in the <em>Cost Management + Billing</em> blade.</p>

<p>The customer experience is slightly different post whitelisting and is as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Payment Method Update - Banner in Billing Profile -&gt; Payment Methods tab</strong></p>

<p><span asset="4510965" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4510965]</span></p>

<p><strong>Invoice Mode of Payment Popup</strong></p>

<p><strong><span asset="4510966" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4510966]</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>Updated Payment Method</strong></p>

<p><strong><span asset="4510971" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4510971]</span></strong></p>

<h4>Payment Instrument Management</h4>

<p>Customers must manage their PIs using the Billing Profile tab in the Cost Management + Billing blade.<br>
Support on behalf of the customer for Payment Instrument Management will not be available in CST until (tentatively) <span lang="EN">H1FY21</span>. For customers that are having issues or are unable to manage their payment instruments, engage PayOps following the guidelines in <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2651579" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2651579</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: ACE should only be contacted through the ASE engagement path. ASE will engage ACE and then will provide&nbsp;you with their response.</p>

<h4>Customer Led Joining CSP</h4>

<p>Partners will be unable to pull in a Customer Led subscription. To support these customers, we must transfer the subscription from Customer Led to Web Direct (3P) in CST, then have the Partner request ownership of the converted subscription.</p>

<p>For more information, see the <em>Asset Transfer (SoT Subscription Ownership Transfer)</em> section of the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4487934" managed-link="" target="">Modern Commerce Support Tooling</a> (internal only) page.</p>

<h4>Modern Customer Has Received but Not Yet Activated a Legacy Benefit Offer</h4>

<p>Upon signing up for a subscription, customers who have received a benefit offer (VSE, Sponsorship, etc.) may receive a Modern Customer Led 17G subscription. Please note that Sponsorship and benefit offers are <em>not </em>currently supported in Modern.</p>

<p>These customers may also contact support in the following scenarios:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Customer receives sponsorship or some benefit offer from Microsoft.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Customer signs up for a subscription. This will likely&nbsp;be a Modern Free Trial or Modern PAYG subscription.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Customer consumes on the Modern subscription and is surprised by a bill at the end of the month.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Customer contacts support, asking to apply benefits to subscription.&nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol>
</ol>

<p>In these scenarios, you shoud the following if the customer requests to have their subscription converted back to Legacy so that they can use their credits: ,</p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal" type="1">
	<li>If they haven&#39;t already done so, ask the customer to creates their Legacy entitlement subscription. To do so the customer must do the following:
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" type="a">
		<li>Navigate to <em>Add Subscription</em> in Ibiza.</li>
		<li>Select <strong>Add a diff</strong><strong>erent type of subscription</strong>.<br>
		&nbsp;<span asset="4561356" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4561356]</span></li>
		<li>If entitled correctly, the customer will see their offer type in the subscription list (63P, 36P, etc.)</li>
		<li>Once provisioned, the customer will have both a Modern account and a Legacy account.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Confirm the Legacy account is active in CMAT.
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" type="a">
		<li>Also confirming there is an active subscription.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Explain to the customer the multi-account landscape (both a Modern and Legacy account will show in the Billing Scope of Cost Management + Billing). Also inform the customer of the following:&nbsp;
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" type="a">
		<li>Going forward, they will need to be precise when creating new subscriptions to ensure it is under the correct account.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>One billing account will have a MOSP Agreement and the other will have a MCA.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Customer Wants an Existing Modern Subscription Converted to Legacy</h4>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal" type="1">
	<li>Perform an <em>Asset transfer</em> on the Modern Subscription using the <em>Legacy</em> Destination Transfer Type with Source and Destination the same and the desired Offer type.</li>
	<li>Confirm that a new<em> Rating Asset h</em>as been created and has a First Party Change State of <em>Disabled</em>.<br>
	<span asset="4561357" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4561357]</span></li>
	<li>Confirm that the subscription offer type is correct and shows in CMAT under the <em>Legacy</em> account.</li>
	<li>Explain to the customer the multi-account landscape (both a Modern and Legacy account will show in the Billing Scope of Cost Management + Billing). Also inform the customer of the following:&nbsp;
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha" type="a">
		<li>Going forward, they will need to be precise when creating new subscriptions to ensure it is under the correct account.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>One billing account will have a MOSP Agreement and the other will have a MCA.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1">&nbsp;<span asset="4561358" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4561358]</span></p>
