<h3><strong><a id="1" name="1"></a>Summary</strong></h3>

<p><span>On April 2<sup>nd</sup> 2020, Gavriella Schuster has made a blog post, </span><a href="https://blogs.partner.microsoft.com/mpn/responding-to-covid-19-microsoft-partner-network/"><span>responding to COVID-19: Microsoft Partner Network update</span></a><span>. Blog was updated on August 4<sup>th</sup> 2020, informing that Partners with AD between July 1 and December 31, 2020 are now eligible for the COVID-19 extension plan. The Global Admin or MPN partner admin will see information specific to their company in Partner Center by the end of August 2020.</span></p>

<p><span>In the blogpost the approach that Microsoft will be taking to offer Partners the support they need in the weeks and months to come was outlined.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>In alignment to what was shared in the aforementioned blogpost, please find bellow the comprehensive guide that enables you to understand who&rsquo;s eligible for the adjustments made to programs, additional Partner facing resources and further Partner actions. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Please note that for adjustments to Competencies and Azure Expert MSP programs more information will be offered during this month to our Partners </span></strong><span>so we highly encourage you to state the same to any Partners contacting us with questions related to this blog post or topics included in itself. </span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A. </span></span></span></span>We recently uncovered an error in our data that resulted in some partners seeing competencies they did not attain, and the associated incremental benefits that they were not eligible for, in Partner Center. We&rsquo;ve corrected the issue and the information you now see in the Benefits section of Partner Center accurately reflects your organization&rsquo;s competencies and benefits. If you assigned an incremental subscription and it&rsquo;s no longer available, please check your current Benefits to see if you have another Visual Studio subscription you can assign.</p>
