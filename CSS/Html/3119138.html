<p><strong><u><span>Visual Studio Marketplace Subscription</span></u></strong><br>
<span>This program brings together a set of exclusive benefits into one experience, making the developers job easier. The Visual Studio Marketplace is a new destination, the exclusive place for purchasing Visual Studio subscriptions and Visual Studio Team Services extensions. </span></p>

<p><span>Visual Studio Subscriptions are new flexible ways of purchasing Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise to provide great options for customers who are embracing the cloud for software development. </span></p>

<p><span>Visual Studio Professional and Visual Studio Enterprise will each be offered as monthly or annual subscriptions, sold through the new Visual Studio Marketplace. Visual Studio subscriptions are a new way to acquire the Visual Studio IDE along with cloud services. Visual Studio is launching new subscription options that allow subscribers more flexibible options when it comes to leveraging products and services.</span></p>

<p><strong><u><span>Note</span></u></strong><span>: From the ASMS support perspective, a Visual Studio Marketplace subscription is similar to a VSTS license and the usage will appear as a separate line item in the usage report. There is no separate Offer type for Visual Studio Marketplace subscription as such. Example: the user will have a PAYG subscription, and the VS Marketplace subscriptions will be a line item in the CSV file.&nbsp; No separate subscription will show up in CMAT like an Azure Marketplace subscription does. </span></p>

<div><strong>Note</strong>: When a customer tries to add more than 20 Marketplace subscriptions, a <em>Contact Support&nbsp;</em>message will be displayed. In these instances, contact the <strong>Azure DevOps</strong> team via TFS to increase the VS Marketplace quota limit.&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong>Only OMS accounts are eligible for purchasing a Visual Studio Marketplace subscription.</strong></p>

<p>MINT accounts need to be backfilled to OMS before the customer can purchase a Visual Studio Marketplace subscription.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong><strong>an I buy the new Visual Studio subscriptions from my software reseller?</strong></p>

<p><span>No, these new Visual Studio subscriptions are only sold via the Visual Studio Marketplace which uses Azure for billing. Resellers can sell Azure (prepaid amounts of Azure services) through the Enterprise Agreement, MPSA, and Open programs, but while prepaid Azure funds on the Enterprise Agreement and MPSA can be used toward most Azure services, <span>they </span>cannot be used to pay for Visual Studio subscriptions. Prepaid funds in Open can be used to pay for Visual Studio subscriptions.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>What types of Azure subscriptions can be used to purchase Visual Studio subscriptions?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Visual Studio subscriptions can be purchased through almost any type of Azure subscription: Enterprise Agreement, Gov offers, EA Dev/Test, Open, Pay-As-You-Go, Visual Studio subscriber monthly Azure credits, etc. However, the $200 free trial cannot be used to pay for these Visual Studio subscriptions. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Can monthly Azure credits be used to purchase Visual Studio subscriptions?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>No, monthly Azure credits (such as the $150/month credit for Visual Studio Enterprise with MSDN subscribers or the $100/month credit for Microsoft Partner Network organizations) cannot be used to purchase Visual Studio subscriptions.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Can Visual Studio Team Services extensions be purchased with prepaid funds on the Enterprise Agreement or MPSA?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Yes.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Are Visual Studio subscriptions the only services that cannot be purchased with prepaid funds?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>No, there are other Azure services which cannot be purchased with prepaid funds, notably Azure Support Plans, 3rd party offerings in the Azure Marketplace, and Oracle VMs.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Why can I not use my subscriber monthly Azure credit to purchase Visual Studio subscriptions?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>The monthly Azure credit you get as a Subscriber Benefit is for trying out Azure services risk-free, for prototyping and proofs-of-concept, and for light development and testing workloads. This monthly credit enables Visual Studio subscribers to build skills in using Azure as part of their software development. New Azure services are being released regularly, so having this credit is key to staying on top of the rapid changes underway as Azure evolves. </span></p>

<p><span>The Visual Studio IDE is already included in Visual Studio standard subscriptions (e.g., Visual Studio Enterprise 2015 is included for Visual Studio Enterprise with MSDN subscribers) and Visual Studio Team Services access is included as well, so the monthly Azure credit only applies to other Azure services.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Are there supplemental Enterprise Agreement discounts available for Visual Studio subscriptions?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>No, the only discounts available are based on volume of purchases.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Are there renewal discounts?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>No, prices for Visual Studio subscriptions are flat&mdash;the same price is offered for new and continuing customers.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>What happens if a customer is unable to purchase/sign up for Azure Subscription at the time of VS Profile creation?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>ASMS will assist with the Azure subscription sign-up issues occurring due to one or more of the following: </span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Verification by phone </span></p>

<p><span><span>o<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Credit Card issues/declines</span></p>

<p><strong><span>What happens if an Azure subscription linked with VS cancelled and customer requests to reinstate the subscription?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>ASMS will assist the customer with re-enabling a cancelled Azure subscription as long as there are no outstanding charges.&nbsp;</span><span>F</span><span>or guidance on re-enabling a subscription refer to TSG </span><span lang="EN-IN"><a href="/en-us/help/2651536">2651536</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong>Can a customer cancel an Azure subscription with a connected VS subscription? If yes, what are the implications? </strong></p>

<p>Customers can cancel their Azure subscription at any time. However, when <span>the Azure subscription is cancelled all the linked VS licenses get cancelled, even if they have already paid for the rest of the term. Even after the Azure subscription is re-enabled, the VS licenses don&#39;t get re-enabled. The customer will need to repurchase the licenses and assign them to users.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>How do I cancel/downgrade VS subscription? </span></strong></p>

<p><span>1. From manage.visualstudio.com, click <strong>Change Quantity.</strong><br>

<p><span>2. Change the <strong>Users</strong> field to to 0.</span></p>

<p><span>3. Click <strong>Update</strong>, and then click <strong>Confirm</strong>.</span></p>

<p><strong><u><span>Note</span></u></strong><span>: Annual plan &ndash; If an annual subscription is cancelled, customer still has access to select benefits. We&rsquo;ll have a way to opt-out of auto-renewal in early 2016, and we&rsquo;ll send a reminder email well in advance of renewal.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Account owner/Service admin for this subscription is no longer accessible and there are no co-admins. Our subscribers are blocked. How can we take ownership of this subscription?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>A best practice would be to ensure that there are more than 1 admin on a given account. This will ensure we avoid situations where the admin and the team is locked out. </span></p>

<p><span>If the customer does not have more than one admin on the account, ASMS to proceed with Subscription Ownership Transfer as per the available process. </span></p>

<p><strong><u><span>Note</span></u></strong><span>: Subscription Ownership Transfer will not cause any loss/downtime on the VS side. The admins on the VS also change post transfer. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>My credit card failed. I am going to put a new credit card in. How long before my users get reinstated?<span>&nbsp; </span>Do I need to go through and reassign them (rehydrate scenario)?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>In the current implementation, the customer would essentially be removed from the My Team site, and have to be re-entered. This means that the subscriber has to start over. This may change in the future. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Where and how can I see my usage/bill?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>The usage will show up as separate line item on your Azure subscription invoice. For the annual plan, it will show up once. For the monthly plan, the usage/line item will show up monthly. </span></p>

<p><span>There won&#39;t be a recurring monthly email(s) sent. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>CMAT sample of the usage report (V2 only)&nbsp;as to how the usage will show up: (this line does not exist on the V1 versions). </span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span>In case a customer already has an active Azure profile/account and more than one Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) subscriptions, how do they know with which PAYG subscription is the VS Marketplace subscription going to be linked with? </span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>This is currently in post launch backlog and will be rolled out in the future. </span></li>
	<li><span>The current workaround is to change the Azure subscription name so that customers will be able to see the subscription name instead of generic Pay-As-You-Go. </span></li>
