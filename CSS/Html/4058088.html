<p><span><span><span><span><span>If a payment instrument is failing when attempting to add or update it or if purchase attempts are failing, use the following steps to troubleshoot the issue:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Confirm the billing address on record matches the address used by the customer&#39;s financial institution:</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Make sure the billing address for customer&rsquo;s Microsoft account matches the billing address used by customer&rsquo;s financial institution. Sample advocate messaging: &quot;<em>In order to charge your payment instrument, I need to make sure that billing address we have on record matches the address used by your financial institution. May I have the last four digits of the payment instrument you are using?</em>&quot;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Confirm the billing address, expiration date, and name on the payment instrument are correct.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><span><span>A common mistake is customer&rsquo;s providing their mailing address with their financial institution rather than the billing address the payment instrument is set to which may be the same address but written differently.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><span><span>The addresses may be to the same location but have different abbreviations such as &ldquo;DR&rdquo; instead of Drive or &ldquo;Ave&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Avenue&rdquo;.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Having the exact information is critical to the authorization process.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Verify the customer has provided the correct CVV code.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>American Express</span></span></strong><span><span>: &ldquo;<em>The 4-digit security code located on the front right of your payment instrument. The code is printed on the card and is not raised like the account number. It is typically located above the account number</em>.&quot;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Visa, MasterCard, or Discover:</span></span></strong><span><span> &ldquo;<em>The 3-digit security code located on the back of your payment instrument. The code is printed on the card and is not raised. It is located on or near the signature panel</em>.&rdquo; <strong>Note</strong>: If the Microsoft account address matches the billing address used by the financial institution, try the next solution.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Determine if the payment instrument is newly issued by the customer&rsquo;s financial institution:</span></span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ask if the customer is using a newly issued payment instrument. If the payment instrument is new, confirm the customer has activated it. Sample advocate messaging: &quot;<em>Is this a new payment instrument?</em>&quot;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the answer is yes, use the following messaging: &quot;<em>Have you activated the payment instrument with your financial institution?</em>&quot;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Check for a Risk Alert in MST:</span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Review the Alerts section of MST, see details in KB </span></span></span><span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/2896711" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>2896711 Procedure: How to handle risk rejections and engagement with Risk Ops</span></span></span></span></a></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the rejection is for the payment instrument the customer is trying to add, view the details and engage A&amp;B ERA/Xbox offline team for PayOps escalation, or RiskOps if the reason code instructs you to.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If there is no declined transaction present, the customer is being declined by their bank, or the payment instrument information entered is invalid or incorrect.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Check all payment instruments in MST to see if there are any in <strong>Decline</strong> status.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ask the customer if the outstanding balance on the Microsoft account is more than the available credit on the payment instrument, if applicable. Sample advocate messaging: &quot;<em>Do you know if the available credit balance on your payment instrument is enough to pay for the service? If you are unsure if funds are available, please contact your financial institution.</em>&quot;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer is sure they have sufficient funds, ask the customer if we may settle the balance for the outstanding transaction. &ndash; If yes, process the balance.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the balance will not settle for that payment instrument, check if there is another payment instrument the customer will agree to transfer the balance on to.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the balance transfer fails to settle or the customer does not have another payment instrument to use take the following steps:</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>1. Verify the type of content the transaction was for.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>2. If the content is digital, offset the transaction.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Advise the customer they need to repurchase the content.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the digital content is a subscription, verify if any active time on the subscription came from another source such as a PPC/Token.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Cancel the subscription and provide a replacement token for any time that was active, and was not part of the transaction that was offset.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Reach out to a supervisor to provide the case as an example to the Technical Advisors for issue tracking.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>3. If the content is for a pre-order, the customer needs to wait for the cycle to cancel on its own.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer answers no, use the following messaging &quot;<em>You will not be able to update your payment instrument information on Microsoft account while you are outside of the country where your account is registered</em>&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: If the customer is calling with a bank representative on the line, use the following sample advocate messaging:<em> &quot;The credit card number that you are using cannot be authorized through the billing system. The authorization process does not give me the specific reason for the authorization failure. As an online retailer, we are unable to force a credit card to work when it fails. We have ruled out the most common reasons that may cause your card to fail. Right now, the only solution is to use a different credit card or try again later in 24 to 48 hours.&rdquo;</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Microsoft cannot force a credit card to work. If a customer&#39;s card is being declined, ask the customer to verify that their information is accurate, use a different payment option, or try again in 24 to 48 hours.<br>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: When a payment instrument is banned in MST, it is banned across <strong>all</strong> Microsoft entities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Who can ban a payment instrument?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The Commerce system may automatically ban the customer&#39;s payment instrument if the system finds fraud, billing issues (including a chargeback), or non-payment.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the customer requests we ban their PI to prevent the PI from being used on the customer&rsquo;s Microsoft account or added to any other Microsoft accounts engage A&amp;B ERA or Xbox Offline Team for PayOps escalation.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Regarding banned payment methods identified as banned by the Commerce system follow messaging on risk message</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customers trying to use a debit card as their payment instrument in the LATAM region will receive the following error: <em>&quot;We cannot authorize this payment method. Make sure the information is correct or use another payment method. If you keep getting this message, you may contact your financial institution.&quot;</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Inform the customer that the card issuer or local operating rules may not allow us to accept specific debit cards.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Recommended messaging:<em> &quot;Bank accounts have different rules and some debit cards seem to be accepted while others are not. We do not have an influence on it. It is not a Microsoft decision to block a debit card, but it is likely the issuer or our acquiring bank due to operating rules that will not allow it.&quot;</em></span></span></span></span></li>
