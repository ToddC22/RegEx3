<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</h3>

<p>Australia and New Zealand have consumer laws that protect the rights of customers when they engage in any trade or purchase. To ensure compliance with these laws, we must take special care when responding to customer concerns regarding the quality and support provided for Microsoft products purchased by these customers.</p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="2" name="2"></a>2.&nbsp;Addressing the customer&rsquo;s issue</h3>

<p>When a customer in ANZ contacts Support about an issue with a product or service, follow the general workflow common for all regions as applicable:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Determine and understand the customer&rsquo;s concern.</li>
	<li>Pull up the registration of the customer&rsquo;s product or service.
	<ul class="sbody-free_list">
		<li>Create a new product or service registration, as necessary.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Follow all available troubleshooting to resolve the customer&rsquo;s issue.</span><span><span> </span></span></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer refuses to troubleshoot, explain that without doing so, Microsoft may be unable to determine whether there is a fault, which means that it will be difficult for Microsoft to decide whether the customer is entitled to a remedy.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span></span><span>If the issue persists after troubleshooting, identify whether the product or service is within the express warranty period. If not, determine whether the product or service is covered by consumer guarantees. See KB </span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4100081" target="_blank">4100081</a><span>.</span></p>
		</li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>If the fault is minor, offer to process a repair or exchange, depending on the product</span></span></span></span>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Refer to KB </span></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4100081" target="_blank"><span><span><span>4100081</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>,</span></span></span><span><span> so they may understand their rights.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If you are not sure if the fault is major or minor, and the customer demands a refund, escalate the matter.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Otherwise, explain the repair/exchange process to the customer.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>There are additional considerations if the customer went through two or more device exchanges. See KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4502115" managed-link="" target="_blank">4502115 Procedure: Assisting customers from Australia or New Zealand who have had two or more device exchange orders</a>.</p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Refunds </span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>As previously mentioned, a customer from ANZ may request a refund for the cost of the product or service.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A customer is eligible to receive a refund if all the following are true.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4 class="sbody-h4"><a id="3.1" name="3.1"></a>3.1&nbsp;Determining refund eligibility</h4>

<ul>
	<li><span>There is a major fault in the product or service that cannot be resolved by repair or replacement (see KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4100081" target="_blank">4100081</a>). If the fault is a major one that can be resolved by a repair or replacement, but the customer wants a refund, the customer is entitled to a refund.</span></li>
	<li><span>The customer specifically asks for a refund.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span>Customer has provided proof of purchase for the product or service in question.</span>

	<ul>
		<li><span><strong>Exception:</strong> If the customer&#39;s purchase is visible in MST as a purchase made in One Store, the customer is contacting support on the Microsoft account that has the transaction visible, and the device in question is registered on the Microsoft account, consider this as valid proof of purchase.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<div><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></div>
</div>

<h4 class="sbody-h4"><a id="3.2" name="3.2"></a>3.2 Processing refund requests</h4>

<p>To process a refund request, follow these steps:</p>

<ol class="sbody-num_list">
	<li>Ask the customer to prepare a copy of the proof of purchase for the device. This may be requested by a specialist.</li>
	<li>Check the date of purchase of the device.
	<ul class="sbody-free_list">
		<li><span>If the device is within 30 days from the date of purchase, inform the customer that they have the option of having the cost refunded by the retailer or by Microsoft. It is possible that the refund may be processed faster by the retailer</span>.</li>
		<li>If the device is within an express warranty but is outside 30 days from the date of purchase, inform the customer that while they have the option to obtain the refund from the retailer, it might be faster and more convenient to have the refund processed by Microsoft.</li>
		<li>If the device is outside the express warranty period&nbsp;but may be within the consumer guarantee period (see KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4100081" target="_blank">4100081</a>), inform the customer that their concern requires handling by a specialist<span><span>.</span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Set expectations with the customer that refunds are handled by a specialist team and that the product needs to be retrieved before a refund is processed. The specialist team member will inform you or the customer about the process of sending the product to Microsoft.</li>
	<li>Ensure that you have documented the issue, the date of purchase, the amount the customer paid, and the customer&rsquo;s specific demand for a refund.</li>
	<li>Follow your current line of business&#39;s escalation path.</li>
</ol>
