<p><span><span><span><span>Co-sell Ready refers to solutions that have met the Co-sell Ready requirements and are eligible to participate in the Co-sell program. Co-sell Ready solutions are discoverable by Microsoft Sellers in the OCP Catalog, are enabled to share and receive leads with Microsoft sellers, and have access to Sell with and GTM benefits. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>IMPORTANT:</p>

<p>To co-sell with Microsoft, partners need a commercial-ready solution, an engaged sales team, and a strong go-to-market strategy. They must also meet specific additional criteria.

	<li><span><span><span><span>Partner to Partner (P2P) &ndash; This is where one partner can invite other partners in the Microsoft Co-sell ecosystem to collaborate. Partners can optionally invite a Microsoft sales representative to the deal to help close the deal.

	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Private pipeline deal</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> - These are opportunities that a partner decides to work on independently while creating them in partner center.

<p><strong>Add their employees (Add team members) </strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>After adding the deal details, partners should add the employees that will be working on this specific deal. They will need to enter the name, phone number and email address of the employee. These details are mandatory, and they need to have at least one contact with all the details entered for them to create a deal. These details can be changed even after creating a deal. Recent contacts from their previous deals are shown on the right side for them to quickly to add them to the deal.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Add solution(s)</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In this section, partners need to provide the information related to the solutions that will be part of this deal. This is a mandatory section where they need to add at least one solution for them to create a deal. The solution details can be changed even after creating a deal. There are multiple types of solutions that can be added to a deal which are described below</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>My company&rsquo;s solutions</span></span></span><span><span><span>: These are Co-sell ready solutions that are published by partner&rsquo;s company</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Microsoft</span></span></span><span><span><span>: These are solutions owned by Microsoft</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Other third-party solutions</span></span></span><span><span><span>: These are Co-sell ready solutions that are published by other partners in the Microsoft Co-sell ecosystem</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Important </span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span>Although partners can add multiple solutions to a deal, they can add only one incentive eligible solution. This can be either IP incentive eligible solution or an ISV connect offer. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Once they have provided all the necessary information, they should select <strong>Next</strong> to move to the section where they can decide the collaborative selling type. They have three options here as described below.</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Private pipeline deal</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: If partners don&rsquo;t invite Microsoft or any other partner and create an engagement at this step, it will be of the type private pipeline. Microsoft sellers will have no visibility in to the details of this deal.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Important</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: </span></span></span><span>Deal registration is not applicable for Private deals. Exercise caution while creating a private deal with incentive eligible solutions as they will not be eligible for deal registration in Partner Center</span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Co-sell deal: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>If partners switch the toggle to yes for the question &ldquo;<strong><span><span>Would you like Microsoft&#39;s help?</span></span></strong></span></span></span><strong><span><span><span><span><span>&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span><span>, the deal turns in to a Co-sell deal where a Microsoft seller can potentially help them with closing the deal. A request to help from Microsoft is no guarantee that a Microsoft seller will participate in the deal and they are given 14 days to decide if they want to help partners with the specific request made while inviting Microsoft. Do mention in detail the kind of help required from Microsoft in the notes section when they are inviting Microsoft.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span> Important:&nbsp;</span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span>To co-sell with Microsoft, partners need a commercial-ready solution, an engaged sales team, and a strong go-to-market strategy. They must also meet specific additional criteria.

<h4 class="alert-title"><strong>Responding to a Co-sell opportunity</strong></h4>

<p class="alert-title"><span><span><span>Each opportunity moves through a life cycle of its own and this section will help understand the different stages and the actions that partners can take in each stage.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Received stage</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: In this stage they have received a new Co-sell opportunity either from a Microsoft seller or from other partners in the Microsoft Co-sell ecosystem. Partners will need to </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>review the details, and feel free to contact the customer if they want to learn more about their business needs. They can take two action in this stage. Either accept or decline the referral:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Accept</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Partners should enter a name for the deal, edit the estimated deal value, and the estimated purchase timeframe based on their review. They should also provide info in the <strong>Notes</strong> field to explain more about what the customer is looking for once they have established the contact with the customer either directly or with the help of the employees from the company which invited the specific company to participate in the deal. They can optionally enter their CRM ID (for the reference only), the marketing campaign ID which resulted in the respective opportunity and add contacts from their company who will be working on this deal. When they&rsquo;ve finished, they should select <strong>Next</strong>. We&#39;ll move the referral to <strong>the next stage</strong>, which means they plan to actively engage with the customer to address their need. We&#39;ll also use this information to help partners find similar deals in the future.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Decline</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Partners should select the reason they are declining the deal and add any notes they would like to include, then select <strong>Close deal</strong>. We&#39;ll archive it as <strong>Declined</strong> and notify either Microsoft or the partner who sent them this opportunity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If they don&#39;t respond within the allotted time (currently 14 days), we&#39;ll archive it as <strong>Expired</strong> and notify either Microsoft or the partner who sent them this opportunity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="alert-title"><strong><span><span><span>Accepted stage</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Partners will need to work to close the deal with the customer. If they want to change any of the information they&rsquo;ve provided for an accepted referral, they should select <strong>Edit</strong>. They can then update the deal name, estimated purchase date, estimated value, notes, CRM ID and/or the marketing campaign id. They can also select <strong>Add your team</strong> to provide the name, phone number, and email addresses of any additional people who are working on the deal. Solutions can also be edited based on the customer need. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>All the deals that they have created will be in Accepted stage by default.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>IMPORTANT: Once you started working on the deal, you can provide the details of the progress that you are making by marking the </span><strong><span><span>sales stages in the deal lifecycle</span></span></strong><span>. There are four stages in the deal lifecycle apart from the initial acceptance or creation and the final won or lost stages as mentioned below. Providing these details is optional, but you are highly encouraged to share these to get stage appropriate help from Microsoft sales representatives in a Co-sell deal.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>When you&#39;re finished, you can take one of the two actions, which are marking the deal as Won or Lost to report the outcome.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Note It is not necessary that your company follows the same sales stages. This is how Partner Center recognizes the deal sales stages and will automatically map the stages of your company to these standard stages if you are passing these values using the API. If you are using the Partner Center UX, the percentages as shown in the table are used to mark the sales stages.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For certain eligible solutions, after you select Won, you&#39;ll be asked to provide additional information to register your deal. Microsoft will review the info you provide here and may ask for additional details during the review process. For more information, see <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/register-deals?branch=master" managed-link="" target="_blank">Register your deals</a>- LINK- <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/register-deals?branch=master" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/register-deals?branch=master</a></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>A deal will be eligible for deal registration only if it meets all the below criteria:</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>1. Microsoft is invited to the deal.</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>2. Microsoft has either accepted the invitation or marked the deal as won. You can understand the Microsoft status by looking at the Microsoft card below your deal details. </span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>3. There is an incentive eligible solution in the deal.</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><strong>HOW TO CHECK MICROSOFT CARD: </strong></p>

<p><span asset="4584668" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4584668]</span></p>

<p><span asset="4584669" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4584669]</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>To check the decline reason for the referral, partners can access the Microsoft card and check the decline reason.</span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>If partners are not finding any decline reason that means that the referral expired (Microsoft seller did not managed &nbsp;to decline the referral withing 14 days) or it&rsquo;s less than 25,000 USD. </span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If the deal is eligible for deal registration, there will be additional milestone added to the lifecycle of the deal called &quot;Deal registration&quot; as shown below.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span asset="4584670" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4584670]</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>You can choose to register the deal immediately after marking the deal as won or at a later point in time through the deal lifecycle <strong><span>Register now</span></strong> button. Once the deal is registered you can view the progress of the deal validation from the same lifecycle. If there is any action required from your company, appropriate errors are shown in the deal lifecycle view. The deal goes into the closed state when the deal validation is complete.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Co-sell deal: If you select any option other than the default selection for the question &ldquo;Identify the type of help you&#39;d like from Microsoft&rdquo;, the deal turns in to a co-sell deal where a Microsoft seller can potentially help you with closing the deal.

	<li><span><span><span>Estimated close date: This is the date by which you expect the invited partner to complete their part of the deal. The date is pre-filled so that you can choose to modify the date only if necessary. It is a mandatory field and can be edited by the partner you are inviting after creating the deal. You can&rsquo;t modify this field after creating the deal.</span></span></span></li>

Employee details entered in your deal data are pre-filled to make it easier for you to choose the employees who be working with this specific partner.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Add solutions: Add the solutions that you want the invited partner to bring to the table. At least one solution is mandatory. The invited partner can modify the solutions once they accept the invitation.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Identify the type of help: Finally, identify the specific help you need from the invited partner. Repeat this for all the partners you want to invite to be a part of this deal.
