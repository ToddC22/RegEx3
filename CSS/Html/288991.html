<header><h1>Enabling the administrator to have access to redirected folders</h1></header><div class='kb-summary-section section'>This article discusses the Folder Redirection feature and how it can be used, particularly by administrators.<br><br>Microsoft Windows Server 2003  and  Microsoft Windows 2000 Server have a feature that can redirect specific user folders to server locations by using a Group Policy extension called Folder Redirection. By default, the Folder Redirection feature enables the user to have exclusive access to the redirected folder.<br><br>Many administrators want the Folder Redirection feature to enable a user&#39;s folders to be automatically redirected to a newly created folder for each user, but, at the same time, to have the Administrators group automatically added to the NTFS file system&#39;s access control list (ACL).<br></div><div class='kb-moreinformation-section section'>When you redirect folders by using Group Policy, it is recommended that you enable the Folder Redirection client-side feature to automatically create the user&#39;s folders to ensure that the folder is secure. By default, administrators do not have access to the redirected folders.<br><br>To make the redirected folders secure, the Folder Redirection feature performs the following actions:<ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Gives ownership of the folder to the user.</li><li>Sets the following ACLs on the folder:<br><strong class='sbody-strong'>User</strong>: Full Control<br>Local System: Full Control </li><li>Prevents inheritance of ACLs from the parent folder.</li></ul>To access the files in a user&#39;s redirected folders, the administrator must either log on as the user whose folder is being redirected or take ownership of the folder and manually change the ACLs on the folder.<br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span> The act of taking ownership can cause subsequent redirections to be unsuccessful because the Folder Redirection feature ensures that the user is the owner of the folder to which they are being redirected. <br><br>To avoid the preceding issues, you can configure the Folder Redirection feature to enable administrator access but to still automatically create folders in a secure manner.<br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Windows Server 2003</h3><h4 class='sbody-h4'>To set security on the shared folders in Windows Server 2003</h4><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Log on as an administrator to the server that can host the user&#39;s redirected folders.</li><li>Locate the top-level folder that can hold the user&#39;s redirected documents (for example, D:\Redirected, which is shared as \\Server\Redirected\) by  using Windows Explorer.
