<p><span><strong><span>Customer Setup Form</span></strong><span> (CSF) &ndash; A submission form used for advertisers who wish to be setup for invoice billing. </span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Invoiced Accounts </span></strong><span>&ndash; </span><span>Advertisers can be setup for invoiced billing which requires a Billing ID, also known as an SAP ID, to be associated to their Microsoft Advertising accounts. This allows the customer to make payments against their SAP ID upon receipt of their monthly invoice.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Microsoft Risk Assessment</span></strong><span> &ndash; The Microsoft Credit Team are required to conduct certain risk assessments on Microsoft advertisers who wish to be billed by invoice. This helps to minimize the financial loss to the business.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Flip Requests</span></strong><span> &ndash; A common phrase used to refer to Advertisers who would like to change their existing prepay/post-pay Microsoft Advertising account to invoiced billing in order to keep their historical performance.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>SAP </span></strong><span><span><span>&ndash;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>it<strong> </strong>is a billing application used to keep track of amounts owed and paid by monthly invoice advertisers. SAP IDs are created for unique Company Name+Address combinations. All address updates must be conveyed to Worldwide Online Credit Services (WOCS) so that they can make the proper changes in SAP.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>SAP IDs will not be issued without a completed Customer Setup Form.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>An SAP ID may be classified as either Bill-To (with an associated credit line) or Sold-To (no credit line). </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>The same SAP ID is used for search and display advertising, and therefore may already exist for new search advertisers. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>SAP IDs are created and may be entered into an existing customer shell. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>One Bill-To SAP ID may be used in more than one CID, and </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>One CID may contain multiple Bill-To SAP IDs if there is any agency association.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span>Bill-To</span></strong><span> <span><span>&ndash; </span></span>Specifies who pays the bill. An advertiser who has a Bill-To (no hold) SAP has been approved for a credit line with Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Sold-To </span></strong><span><span>&ndash; </span></span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Specifies who services are provided for. An advertiser with a Sold-To SAP cannot be the Bill-To on the invoice because he/she does not have credit approval. Sold-to setup is typically used for clients of agencies where the agency is the Bill-To. Sold-To SAPs may be converted to Bill-To with the submission of another CSF form to WOCS.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Bill to Agency</span></strong><span> &ndash; company service business dedicated to creating, planning and managing advertising (and sometimes other forms of promotion) for its customers. Sample services: Branding strategies, Overall marketing, Sales promotions, SEO, and SEM.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Bill to Advertiser</span></strong><span> &ndash; advertiser is the Web site owner or merchant who pays affiliates for sending traffic to their site to purchase or generate leads. Organization or company that places advertisements in order to target customers.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Subsidiary SAPs </span></strong><span><span>&ndash; </span></span><span>&nbsp;SAP IDs are created for unique Company Name+Address combinations, therefore, subsidiaries may have their own SAP ID even if the Bill-To address is the same as the parent. Subsidiary </span></span><span><span>SAP IDs can be established if&nbsp;there is some public identifier that the subsidiary legally exists.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Agency SAPs </span></strong><span><span>&ndash; </span></span><span>&nbsp;If an agency would like to create an additional account under their shell for themselves and already has an existing No Hold SAP ID, the agency&#39;s existing No Hold SAP ID may be used as the Sold-To if the SAP address matches the account.</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Ensure that all documents with customer PII, MBI and HBI are shared using the DTM tool. Use the shared credential or yours @msncs.com to access the link.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>Shared Credential Username: cssba_msft@msncs.com.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Do not send any unencrypted files to Tier 1 support. All files should be encrypted using <strong>CSSMicrosoft Advertising&nbsp;</strong>password.</span></span></span></p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span><span><span><span>For New SAP ID creation, ensure that the advertiser meets the minimum Microsoft Advertising age and spend history requirements. The company that requests invoice setup must have advertised as the Bill-to party on Microsoft Advertising for at least 12 months and must meet the minimum spend requirement in at least three&nbsp;of the 12 months. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>For agencies, aggregate client spend can be used to determine minimum spend eligibility.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>As of December&nbsp;2019, there is a new minimum spend threshold for <strong>unmanaged advertisers</strong>. Advertisers must meet the following spend requirements in at least three&nbsp;out of the prior 12 months:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>US and Canada: $5000 USD/CAD per month.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>Other Mature Markets (Includes AU, FR, DE, JP, KP, KR, NZ, NL, SG, UK, WE Region): $3000 USD equivalent per month.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>Emerging Markets (Includes BR, NL, and APAC/CEE/LATAM/MEA Regions): $2000 USD equivalent per month.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>Exceptions to the 12-month spend history may be made if the customer meets the three months spend criteria and is willing to provide <strong>Financial Statements or the required Security Deposit</strong>.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol start="3">
	<li><span><span><span><span>Ensure that the account currency is accepted for Monthly Invoice </span></span><span><span>Billing. Use this </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50828/3" managed-link="" target="_blank">link</a> <span><span>to</span></span><span><span> validate the currency-market partnership permitted by the system.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>Monthly invoicing is not supported for all currencies, and the currencies that are accepted differ depending on the billing center the advertiser is aligned to.</span></span></span></p>

<ol start="4">
	<li><span><span><span><span>Determine from the CSF preliminary setup form, whether the customer exists and must be upgraded or must be created. New customer shells will need to be created by the customer first, before an SAP ID can be applied; please advise your requestor to ensure the customer has a valid Microsoft Advertising account before submitting to WOCS.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Check that there are no duplicate SAP IDs already existing by searching on the Business Name and/or VAT number in the SAP ID Report. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
	<li><span><span>Ensure <span><span><span><span>that&nbsp;requestor has provided a fully completed the&nbsp;<a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/StandardSupport/l1resources/default.aspx" target="_blank">CSF Template</a>&nbsp;and has requested invoice billing in a supported currency. If the advertiser&#39;s business location is in an&nbsp;<strong>APAC country</strong>, ensure that the requestor submitted two years of financial statements with their request as these documents are required. Do not proceed if the financial statements are not included if the advertiser is in an APAC country.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li>Check to see if this is a <strong>Sole Proprietor</strong><span> setup request. Sole Proprietors are defined as being a business that is owned and run by one natural person, in which there is no legal distinction between the person and the business. You can check to see if a customer is a Sole Proprietor by looking up their business in the market-specific government site listed in the&nbsp;<a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/StandardSupport/l1resources/default.aspx" target="_blank">Online Validation Links file</a>.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-2"><span><span><span>If the customer is a Sole Proprietor, their business will not show up in these sites or will not have a tax ID associated with hit. If this is the case, <strong>first</strong> suggest that they use a credit card instead of invoice billing. Let them know that there are additional requirements for setting up invoice billing for Sole Proprietors, and they will be required to: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span>Pay a deposit matching the amount that they are requesting for a credit line. The minimum is $1,000 USD. Microsoft will retain the deposit for the entire time they are advertising with Microsoft Advertising. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span>Deposit Form<span> (to be sent to customer). </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>MSFT Banking Information and Remittance Instructions can be found on KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3175877" target="_blank">3175877 Process: Microsoft Advertising: How to Pay</a><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span>The customer&#39;s credit limit will not increase over time. It will be fixed based on their deposit amount. If they want to increase it, they will need to add more to their deposit. Microsoft will retain the deposit for the entire time they are advertising with Microsoft Advertising. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> If the customer becomes a registered business at some point, they will be able to apply for a standard credit line without a deposit, that will increase over time. This will be subject to a separate risk evaluation from WOC.</span></span></span></p>

<ol start="8">
	<li><span><span><span><span>Confirm the advertiser is not currently on <strong>Credit Hold</strong> (should be clarified to the requestor for resolution prior to continuing setup process and ticket closed as cancelled) and also ensure that the advertiser&#39;s &#39;Customer&#39; information within Microsoft Advertising UI matches the information being submitted via CSF. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="9">
	<li><span><span><span><span>Check that the information provided by the advertiser matches their legal registration and/or VAT information.&nbsp;You can do this by accessing the relevant link from the&nbsp;<a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/StandardSupport/l1resources/default.aspx" target="_blank">Online Validation Links file</a>, and following the guidance contained in this Excel.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="10">
	<li><span><span><span><span>Check that this information also matches the registered information displayed on the company&#39;s URL. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="11">
	<li><span><span><span><span>Check if the Accounts Payable details are valid.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Do not submit a setup request to WOCS until your requestor has been able to provide a customer&#39;s business justification/explanation for any discrepancies you have discovered. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="13">
	<li><span><span><span><span>Static Website Requirements: Websites without any clickable URL pages (known as &#39;static&#39; sites) will always require Credit Manager Approval from WOCS. To improve the chances of being approved, ensure they contain the following: </span></span></span></span>

	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Nature of business</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Name/address of business</span></span></span></span></li>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If you are also being asked to create XID accounts, in addition to creating the SAP ID, check that the Requestor has given you the following information:</span></span></span></span>

	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span>You will need this information to continue with account creation, after the SAP has been provided by WOCS. If the requestor has not provided you with these details, proceed with SAP setup (if possible) and email the requestor back, to ask for this information. This will save any unnecessary delays later in the process.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span>Instructions:</span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span>Validate customers&rsquo; legal/registered name and&nbsp;address via validation sites linked within the form. The legal address will be reflected on SAP by MSNCRED. The billing address (address the customer wants the invoices sent to) can be updated later in the UI.</span></span></p>

			<p><span><span>Indicate the person to contact for billing concerns. The email address or domain should match with the customer&rsquo;s company name. If it does not, please provide an explanation in the business justification section.</span></span></p>

			<p><span><span>Ensure the dialing code is included when entering the telephone number in the accounts payable contact sections.</span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span>Region &ndash; </span></span></strong><span><span>Verify if the selected region is correct. Region is where the business is located.</span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span>Legal structure </span></span></strong><span><span>- (Partnership, corporation, limited liability or sole proprietor. See descriptions below). </span></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong><span><span>Partnership </span></span></strong><span><span>- Typically found in professional services such as accountants, lawyers, doctors or dentists where the partners can share expertise and skills. Partnerships compromise two or more people and any profits, debts and decisions related to the business are shared. </span></span></li>
				<li><strong><span><span>Corporation </span></span></strong><span><span>- Owned by shareholders who each put an amount of money into a central pool. This pool of capital is then added to by borrowing from other forms of finance. Directors run the business on behalf of shareholders, and they all receive a portion/share of the profit.</span></span></li>
				<li><strong><span><span>Limited liability</span></span></strong><span><span> - Intended to benefit professional partnerships such as lawyers or doctors. Offer the business a form of protection for company shareholders and limited partnerships. For these individuals, the maximum sum they can lose from a business is the sum of money they invested in the company.</span></span></li>
				<li><strong><span><span>Sole proprietor </span></span></strong><span><span>- Simplest and most common type of small business. The sole proprietor is responsible for everything the business does. The owners has no separation of their own assets and liabilities which means they are&nbsp;personally responsible for any debts that the business has.</span></span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Notes<span><span>:</span></span></strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span>This section is required to be filled out by the requestor. If left blank, ask the requestor to supply this information before you submit the request to the MSN credit team.</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>Check if the customer is a <strong>Sole Proprietor</strong> or not. </span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>Sole&nbsp;Proprietors should be prepared to pay a security deposit equal to the credit line requested. The minimum is $1,000 USD.&nbsp; Microsoft will retain the deposit for the entire time they are advertising with Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>If the customer agreed to proceed under these terms, note in the <strong>Additional Comment/Notes</strong>&nbsp;box in the CSF that the customer is interested in providing a security deposit. MSN cred will then provide you the instruction on how the customer will provide the security deposit.</span></span></li>

			<p><strong><span>SAP ID type</span></strong><strong><span> &ndash; </span></strong><strong><span><span>Verify if the selected SAP ID type is accurate and corresponds to what the submitter needed. The request can be either a Bill-To, </span></span></strong><span>Sold To or upgrade of Sold-To to Bill To (No hold).</span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span>Sold To is typically used to establish an SAP ID for an agency client when the agency is the Bill To.</span></li>
				<li><span>Advertiser/Clients can upgrade Sold To SAPs to Bill To at any time (CSF submission to WOCS is required just as if it were a new monthly invoice setup request).</span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong><span>Notes:</span></strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span><span>If the request is a Sold-To SAP creation, a Bill-To SAP details must be provided to prevent the account to go dark once flipped.</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>To&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>determine if the SAP ID is a Sold-To, go to Payment Methods tab and check the Credit Limit section. If the amount is zero, it is a Sold To SAP ID.</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Greyed-out section in the CSF means that it is not required.</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Any mismatch with the SAP ID type request must be clarified. See table in <a bookmark-id="Scenario 5" href="#Scenario 5" managed-link="">Scenario 5</a>.</span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span>New CSF credit line requests must now be submitted to Fraud for risk review. Only when the request is cleared by fraud should the CSF be submitted to WOCS for a credit check.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Steps to escalate to the fraud team:</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>1. For CSS/L1 request, create a new parent ticket that is queued under BOS AES queue. Note that the child ticket from L1/CSS is reserved for MSN Credit Escalation. Replicate the ASD Code from the original child ticket request from L1/ CSS advocate and the subject line should contain &quot;Monthly Invoice&quot; or &ldquo;Monthly Invoice Application<em>&quot;.</em></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>When creating a parent ticket for Fraud review purposes, please use &quot;noemail@microsoft.com&quot; as the customer email address. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: For AM request, there is no need to go through Fraud escalation as the account is already managed. Proceed to <a bookmark-id="No. 8" href="#No. 8" managed-link="" target="">No. 8</a>.</span></span></span></p>

</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Make sure to apply the transfer to the correct path.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>5. Once transferred, refresh the queue and wait for resolution from Fraud Team. The resolution can be either:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><strong><span><span><span>Fraudulent/suspicious activity: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Hello &ndash; Our team has researched this account and found suspicious activity. We have closed this account for fraud concerns or,</span></span></span></li>

</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>6. Only when the request is cleared by fraud should the CSF be submitted to WOCS for credit check. If the customer fails the Fraud risk review, inform your submitter by relaying the resolution and cancel the request.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>The estimated SLA for Fraud reviews is two hours.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong><span><span><span>Frontline escalated tickets:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If BOS advocates receive any notifications from the Fraud team with specific actions the customer must take in order to continue with the setup process, the advocate must pass on the notification details on to the Frontline advocate and then close the ticket.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>7.&nbsp;</span></span></span>Once the Fraud Team approved the request, BOS advocates will then continue to escalate to WOCS/MSN Credit team. See the <strong>WOCS UCMT Escalation Process</strong> section of this article. <strong>Note</strong>: Make sure to close the created Fraud ticket.</span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><a id="No. 8" name="No. 8"></a>8. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>WOCS will provide confirmation that the request has been received and will proceed with the Accounts Payable contact verification through OneVet tool once the customer passed the credit checks. Inform your submitter once you received WOCS instruction that the AP contact verification was sent.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1 ng-scope"><span><strong><span><span><span><span>OneVet Authentication:</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span> As part of the Fraud review, the WOCS team use the OneVet tool. This tool sends out an email notification to the customer to verify who they are. The AP contact should expect to receive the verification email within 24 hours of escalating to WOCS. WOCS will confirm when the email is sent. OneVet is used globally for all unmanaged advertisers. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1 ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span>The verification email will arrive from the </span></span></span></span><a href="mailto:MSNCred@microsoft.com" target="_self"><span><span><span>MSNCred@microsoft.com</span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span> alias and will trigger in the language selected for the invoice setup in the CSF. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1 ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span>The verification link in the email is valid for five days. WOCS may close their ticket (UCMT) if the AP contact does not authenticate within 24 hours of receiving the email. However, our ticket should remain open for five business days as a leeway for the submitter to provide the AP contact confirmation from the customer.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1 ng-scope"><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>: We are permitted to reopen the UCMT ticket with WOCS within five business day SLA by replying to WOCS last email communication.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1 ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span>In case the submitter cannot provide an update after five business days, BOS advocate can now close the ticket as cancelled and advise the submitter to redirect to WOCS once they received the customer&rsquo;s confirmation. Provide the UCMT no. to the submitter for reference.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1 ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span>Any concerns regarding the delivery of the<strong><span> OneVet</span></strong> authentication email or completing the authentication steps should be directed to WOCS in the UCMT ticket. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span> WOCS SLA is two business days. In case you have not received any response, email them for an update</span></span></span></span>.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>9. Once MSNCred has approved an SAP ID and entered it into the system, they will notify you by email and you will be able to proceed with account creation. Be aware that SAP IDs may take up to 24 hours to filter into the UI before you can proceed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>10. Once available, go to <strong>Accounts</strong> tab, edit the <strong>Customer details</strong> section. Next, change the <strong>Service Level</strong> to <strong>Premium</strong>. Then select&nbsp;<strong>Save</strong>. This will enable the <strong>Monthly Invoice</strong> option as one of the <strong>Payment setting</strong>. <strong>Note</strong>: Do not change the Service Level&nbsp;without WOCS confirmation.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>11. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>On the <strong><span>Accounts</span></strong> tab, edit the <strong><span>Account details</span></strong> section. Next, edit the <strong><span>Primary contact</span></strong> based on the submitter&rsquo;s preference. Then, on the <strong><span>Payment</span></strong> section, change the <strong><span>Payment setting </span></strong>to<strong><span> Monthly Invoice</span></strong> and select the preferred SAP ID.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1 ng-scope"><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>: You cannot select a Super Admin with a pending invite status. Make sure that the user already accepted the invite unless the submitter to still use the old Super Admin/Primary Contact.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1 ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span>If a post-pay advertiser wants to switch to invoice billing the system will attempt a swipe for the amount owed before switching the account to invoice billing. If the swipe is unsuccessful, the system will not allow the switch. The error message will let the user know the payment failed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>The customer should be aware that any pending balance will be refunded/charged once the account has been flipped. The BOS advocate should confirm this before flipping</span></span></span></span>.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>12. Once the SAP ID Payment Method is already setup, create the Insertion Order. This will prevent the account to turn gray.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you encounter errors when trying to flip an account, ask WOCS for resolution. In case they cannot resolve this, escalate to AdSupport.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>13. The setup is complete. Send your completion email containing the SAP ID and Insertion Order details.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. Additional WOCs c</span></span><span><span>hecks for invoice billing</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span>In addition to doing credit checks for new invoice setup, the WOCS team also does a series of risk checks to ensure that the advertiser meets Microsoft&rsquo;s qualifications.</span></p>

<p><span>If the team identifies any risk flags, they will either put a block the setup request, or they may request that the customer provides us with additional financial guarantees such as Financial Audit documents, Security Deposits, etc. The exact requirements of these guarantees may vary from case to case; please work with the WOCS team to obtain whatever information they may require in order to proceed on behalf of your requestor.</span></p>

<p><span>Below are several checks WOCS do before approving a customer for invoicing.</span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><span><span><span><a id="6.1" name="6.1"></a>6.1 New Microsoft Advertising customers</span></span></span></h4>

<ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>Valid phone number</span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>Address that matches with the business, and payment instrument </span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span><span>Confirm that the company is registered with the Credit Bureau.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Check the URL for fraudulent behavior.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><strong><span>Brazil only:</span></strong><span> Provide CNJP/TAX ID in the WOCS submission.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><strong><span>India only:</span></strong><span> Provide customer identity number (CIN) or any of the following in the WOCS submission:</span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>Certificate of Incorporation signed by the company&rsquo;s legal representatives.</span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>Any Government issued documents having the company name and address. (For example, Tax Certification) </span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>Company Registration form signed and issued by the government.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol start="6">
	<li><span><span>Check the companies email address domain matches the company name: The companies email domain must match the company&rsquo;s name. They will <strong><span><span>not </span></span></strong>require supporting documentation when:</span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>The email domain and company name supplied matches.</span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>The email domain provided is the one reflected in Microsoft Advertising.</span></span>&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><span>If there are cases where there is a domain mismatch, (for example, company email domain name is not the same as the company name), WOCS currently do not have straightforward guidance. They will not require any legal documentation in these cases, but they do require confirmation from the customer stating the relationship so they can validate this from their side. The required information should be something that can help the WOCS team proceed with their validation process (<span><span><span><span><span>for example, subsidiary, branch, and managing agency information).</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>Bindex scoring</span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>Payment history to look for any bad debt</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span>If the&nbsp;customer fails to pass any of these checks the WOCS team will not be able to set the customer up with invoice billing and will let you know why.</span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span>Except for one example scenario (below), do NOT share the information about any of these checks with the customer and instead use the following messaging: </span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><em><span>&ldquo;At this point we recommend prepay/credit card as payment method to give you an opportunity to take advantage form our Microsoft Advertising services and develop a good payment history with Microsoft. You may apply for invoicing in 3-6 months. At that point we will review your company standing and extend a credit line if applicable.&rdquo;</span></em></p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span><span>The only scenario we can discuss with a customer and appeal, assuming there is a good business justification, is:</span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span>Address that matches with the business, and payment instrument.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>If the customer can share a valid business justification for why their address doesn&#39;t match, we can reply to WOCS to request they review their decision based on the customer&#39;s feedback.</span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="7" name="7"></a>7. WOCS UCMT escalation process</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span>UCMT is the ticketing tool used by most of our partner teams. The ASD-UCMT integration allows Tier 1 support advocates to use ASD to generate Tier 2 tickets in UCMT. Issue information is automatically sent to the UCMT ticket and the ASD ticket is also updated with UCMT ticket details.</span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Before escalating to WOCS, and aside from completing a CSF or any legal documents, make sure that the Insertion Order and Super Admin details are already provided by the submitter to avoid ticket delay.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Also, WOCS UCMT escalation is not applicable for AP Contact Updated.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Below are the steps on how to create UCMT for New Invoice Setup and Upgrading <em>Sold To</em> to <em>No Hold</em> requests after Fraud review:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>Create a DTM link to store all the required documents for Monthly Invoice request. Save your CSF Template (macro-enabled file) in your documents with the following naming convention: &lsquo;<em>New Invoice Setup Customer_XID_Customer Name.&rsquo;</em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Open your ticket in <strong>ASD</strong>.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Edit</strong>, locate the <strong>Issue- Specific Details Required?</strong> beneath the Queue, then choose <strong>Yes</strong>.

<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="8" name="8"></a>8. SAP scenario g</span></span><span><span>uidance </span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><strong><span>Scenario 1: Agency is linked to a customer and will be paying the customer&rsquo;s bills.</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Setup:</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span>Agency gets a Bill To SAP ID and end customer gets a Sold To SAP ID.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Once the SAP IDs are set up please inform the requestor, and provide them with the following additional information, which the requestor will need to share with their customer: </span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Once the client has accepted the Agency Enablement invite, you will need to make sure the Agency updates their Payment Method information in order to set the account business location as the client&rsquo;s SAP address. If this isn&rsquo;t done, the account business location will be defined on the back-end as NULL, which could route the client&rsquo;s billing through an incorrect billing center and affect their taxed amount (if they are located in a VAT market).</span></span></span></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Steps to set the account business location:</span></strong></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>Navigate to the Accounts tab in the UI.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Scroll down to the payment method section. Next to the <strong>sold to payment method</strong> see if there is a drop-down list available for you to select an SAP ID.</span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span>If there <strong>is&nbsp;</strong>an ID available, direct the agency to select it. By doing this, it will define the ABL for the client account based on the SAP address of the client. Clients located in a VAT market, they will also need to apply their VAT ID to the account. Assist them by following the process above for applying a VAT to an invoice customer.</span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span>If there <strong>is not&nbsp;</strong>a sold to SAP ID,&nbsp;you can submit a request to msncred to add a sold-to SAP ID for the client account to solve for this issue. Before escalating, confirm the client&rsquo;s business location. If located in a VAT market, also send their VAT ID in the escalation to msncred to get it applied to their account. Once the sold-to SAP ID is available, select it on behalf of the agency.</span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: Customer is not linked to an agency and will paying their own bills.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>

<p>Customer gets a Bill To SAP ID which will serve as both the bill to and sold to ID.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 3: A Partner (aka reseller or channel partner) is linked to their end customers and Partner will be paying the bills.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>

<p>Because of the Partner program definition, Partner will get a Bill To SAP ID which will used as both the Bill to and Sold To as the Partner will be both.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 4: What if an agency manages a mixture of clients that are both managed and unmanaged? Who should the bill-to be set up as?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>

<p>The bill-to must be whoever is paying the bills to Microsoft.</p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="9" name="9"></a>9. Duplication </span></span><span><span>or transfer of SAP ID requests </span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>Sometimes customers wish to transfer or duplicate their SAP ID to a new customer shell. This is allowable with business justification. There is no standard business justification. These requests will be reviewed on a case by case basis. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Sample content of customer email confirmation:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="MsoNoSpacing"><span><span>Ownership of the customer shell (where the existing SAP ID is currently living).</span></span></li>
	<li class="MsoNoSpacing"><span><span>Business justification on why they would like to transfer or share the SAP ID.</span></span></li>
	<li class="MsoNoSpacing"><span><span>The customer agrees to share or transfer the existing SAP.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Send requests to MSNCred@microsoft.com including the business justification/customer reasoning.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> You should pay special attention to whether the SAP ID is Sold-To or Bill-To. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Account shells using a transferred/duplicated Sold-To SAP will not be able to make this the primary payment method for their accounts, however they will not automatically be associated to the same agency that was managing the Sold-To SAP in the original UI Shell either. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Therefore, you will need to link the new CID to the correct Bill-To Agency once the SAP ID has been transferred/duplicated. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>In case the submitter requested to share/transfer the existing SAP ID to the new CID shell and update the AP contact as well, the BOS advocate should follow the steps in sending the transfer/share request to WOCS through UCMT escalation. Then, send a separate email to appropriate Collections Team (without any UCMT ticket number in the email subject line). See KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3188687" managed-link="" target="_blank">3188687 AES: Process: Microsoft Advertising: Billing Information Update</a> for details.</span></span></span></span></span> </span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> In case the customer has access to the new customer shell, for example Super Admin of both CIDs, they can use the <strong><span>Link to an account</span></strong> option by taking over the billing.

<p><span><span><span>Advertisers have two options if their initial request for invoice billing is not approved:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>

</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> The business name on the customer&#39;s financial statements must match the legal company name on the CSF.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Messaging:</span></span></strong><span><span> <em>&ldquo;At this point we recommend prepay/credit card as payment method for the client to give them an opportunity to take advantage of our Microsoft Advertising services and develop a good payment history with Microsoft.

<h3><a id="13" name="13"></a>13.&nbsp;Additional tips</h3>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Scenario 1: The advertiser has less than 6 months spend history with Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Requirements:</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In order to be set up on invoice billing the advertiser must submit a security deposit equivalent of three times the requested credit limit. This deposit may be refunded or applied towards any outstanding balance once good payment history is established. Good payment is history is defined as having:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>No past due invoices within six&nbsp;months and</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Monthly spent should not be lower than 30% of approved credit line for three&nbsp;consecutive months.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Scenario 2: The requested credit limit is above the market threshold (as outlined in the CSF).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<p>The&nbsp;required documents vary by the amount requested (see specifics above in&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4502280#5" managed-link="" target="_blank">CSF</a>&nbsp;chart).</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 3: There is no credit bureau report (as confirmed by WOCS).</strong></p>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>The balance sheet, which summarizes what a firm owns and owes at a point in time.</li>
	<li>The income statement, which reports on how much a firm earned during the period of analysis</li>
	<li>The statement of cash flows, which reports on the cash inflows and the outflows during the period of analysis.</li>
</ol>

<p>If the advertiser is unable to provide financials for two complete fiscal years, a security deposit is required. Security deposits are calculated as three times&nbsp;the total requested credit limit and are held for up to six&nbsp;months, to be returned upon confirmation of a good payment history. Good Payment History is defined as having all non-disputed invoices paid on/before the due date for a minimum of six months. Payment can be submitted through check or wire transfer.</p>

<p><strong>Scenario 4: Required Accounts Payable contacts for US and FR customers - Sold To setup.</strong></p>

<p>Accounts Payable contacts for Sold-To setup are required and should be valid users on the account. Otherwise, the AP contact must also be able to complete email authentication triggered by WOCS through a tool called OneVet.</p>

<p>AP contacts for Sold-To setup are only required for customers located in the US or FR for compliance with sequential liability regulations.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Scenario 5" name="Scenario 5"></a>Scenario 5: Advertiser needs to confirm/justify their requested SAP ID type to match with their business offering.</strong></p>

<p>The advertiser&rsquo;s SAP ID type needs to match their business type in order to be set up for monthly invoice billing. The WOCS team uses the following definitions to determine SAP ID type:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Bill to Agency</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; company service business dedicated to creating, planning and managing advertising (and sometimes other forms of promotion) for its customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;Sample services<em>:</em>&nbsp;Branding strategies, Overall marketing, Sales promotions, SEO, SEM.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Bill to Advertiser</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; advertiser is the Web site owner or merchant who pays affiliates for sending traffic to their site to purchase or generate leads. Organization or company that places advertisements in order to target customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>BOS advocate should inform the submitter the following in case there is a mismatch with the SAP ID and business types.</p>

<h3><a id="14" name="14"></a>14.&nbsp;FAQ</h3>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: An FR Sold-To Customer wishes to receive a copy of their XID Invoice, under the Loi Sapin law. </span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>BOS can provide a copy of the PDF invoice for the XID/s in question. Please obtain this from the UI on behalf of the customer. You (or the requestor) will need to ensure that the customer is verified before you can provide them with this information, using the normal Microsoft Advertising customer verification process.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: I need to request an agency SAP;&nbsp;however, the customer type is &lsquo;Advertiser&rsquo;. What should I do? </span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> See <a bookmark-id="Scenario 5" href="#Scenario 5" managed-link="" target="">scenario 5 table</a> in this article for guidance. Also, we should no longer check for the customer type in Microsoft Advertising UI due to the multi-linking improvements. One of the upgrades included in these improvements is that there is no need to &ldquo;become an agency&rdquo; in order to manage accounts. This setting is removed, and any account can be linked to any other account, including accounts created by an agency or vice versa.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: What should I do if an agency/client is requesting a parallel copy of the invoice received by their agency/client? (For example,&nbsp;a&nbsp;client contacts you to ask for the most recent invoice their agency received on their behalf.)</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A: </span></span></strong><span><span>The way this should be handled will depend on who the Bill To and Sold To parties are in the agency/client relationship:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>A non-Bill To Agency asks for a copy of the invoice for their Advertiser. The Advertiser is listed as Bill To.</span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>In this scenario, the Advertiser is the &lsquo;Microsoft Client&rsquo; and not the Agency.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>The Agency must ask the Advertiser to provide them with a copy of the invoice.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>A Sold To Advertiser asks for a copy of the invoice, and their agency is listed as the Bill To.</span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>In this scenario, the Advertiser is still entitled to ask for a copy of the invoice as a Microsoft Client and we can provide this to them.</span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span>A Bill To Agency/Advertiser asks for a copy of the invoice </span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>In this scenario they are already the Bill To and can retrieve this themselves as a PDF via the <strong>Billing</strong> tab.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: Who may share the SAP?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> There are two&nbsp;scenarios where an SAP ID can be added under a different CID (customer shell):</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Agency set up &ndash; where Sold To SAP ID will be flipped under Bill To (Agency) customer shell (CID)</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Advertiser set up &ndash; where Bill To SAP ID is flipped to different CIDs. The customer shell (CID) must be owned/related to Bill To SAP ID.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: Does the customer type of the new account need to be similar with the account where the SAP ID is currently living? (For example, direct Advertiser to Direct Advertiser or Agency to Agency). </span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Historically, the requirement was that the SAP ID should be added to the CID with the same customer type, for example, Advertiser SAP ID to Advertiser CID. There is now a new feature in Microsoft Advertising where any Bill-to can do multi-linking, so MSNCred have amended their process to allow for the addition of SAP IDs to CID of different customer types.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Does the customer information (legal company name and address) of the new account need to be the same with the existing SAP ID?</strong></span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></strong><span><span> Yes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Do we follow a strict rule that there should be one&nbsp;SAP per company or are there any exemptions?</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> As per process there should be only one&nbsp;SAP ID per customer however there are exemptions, for example, for resellers. All exemptions should be approved by an MSNCred Credit Manager.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Q: </strong><span><strong><span>Can we assist a request to create additional Monthly Invoice Account?</span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span></span><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> <span><span>Yes. BOS should check the following required fields to continue with the request.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Required Fields for Monthly Invoice Account creation.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
