<h3><span><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview </span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></h3>

<p><span>This TSG provides guidance on how to assist customers who have Azure in Open subscriptions<span>. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Azure in Open (AIO) is an offer that allows customers to make monetary commitments through </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/licensing/licensing-programs/open-license.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Open Programs</a> </span><span><span>(Volume Licensing (VLSC) programs). It is available in unlimited quantities with additional credits available for purchase at any time. The offer activates with Online Service Activation (<span>OSA</span></span></span><span><span>)</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> keys, which are valid for 12 months and are applicable to any Azure service that uses monetary commitment. </span></span></p>

<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>AIO keys are valid for five years if unredeemed. Once redeemed, they are valid for 12 months</span></span><span>. </span>After expiration or subscription cancelation, the unused credits disappear.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>AIO accounts do not use a payment instrument (PI) (only tokens), so the rated usage only calculates for the current month.</span></span><span><span> </span></span> <span> </span></li>
	<li><span><span>The customer cannot view any details in the following columns in the usage reports downloaded from CMAT or the <span>Account Portal</span></span></span><span><span>: &ldquo;List Price,&rdquo; &ldquo;Consumption Price,&rdquo; &ldquo;Consumption Discount,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Monetary Credit Amount&rdquo;.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>AIO is only available to OMS accounts, not MINT accounts.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span>SEs support AIO customer<s>s</s>, not distributors. Distributors are a channel between Microsoft and the customer.</span></li>
	<li><span><span>Support plans are not part of the AIO offer. Customers will need to purchase a support plan using a credit card; the offer does not accept reseller credits. You can find this information on the website at </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0111p/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Get Started with Azure in Open Licensing</a></span><span><span> under the &ldquo;Getting Support&rdquo; section.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; AIO subscriptions that are moved to a different directory will not be able to add credits and will encounter the below error:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Something went wrong, Please try again.</p>
</blockquote>

<div>Customers will need to move the subscription back to the default directory to be able to add credits from the Ibiza Portal.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<h3><a id="Customer Experience and Provisioning" name="Customer Experience and Provisioning"></a>Customer Experience and Provisioning</h3>

<h4><strong><span>Notify the Customer/Partner of Low Balance</span></strong><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></h4>

<p><span>Customers are responsible for monitoring their subscription usage to help determine when to purchase more tokens. Monitoring usage is not always an easy task, so an Alerts feature was created to notify customers/partners of low balances. </span></p>

<p><span><span>Email notifications are<span> automatically sent to the customer when the account balance reaches 30% of the initial purchase amount. If the customer wishes to monitor the balance closer or view balance consumption, they can create up to five additional custom alerts. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Alerts can also be set up at the subscription-level and configured to send a notification to two email addresses. During which, the customer can also enter the partner&rsquo;s/reseller&rsquo;s email address to </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>receive an email alert about the remaining credit on the subscription. Alerts are accessible in the Usage and Billing portal under the <strong>Alerts</strong> tab. </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Setting up alerts from the Azure Accounts Portal</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>Send customers the following steps to set up alerts:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>From the <strong>Accounts Portal</strong>, select the AIO subscription and click on the <span><strong><span>Alerts</span></strong> </span><span> </span>tab. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Select <span><strong><span>Credit Remaining</span></strong> </span><span> </span><span> </span>from the <span><strong>Alert For</strong> </span><span> </span>drop-down menu and insert a dollar amount<strong> </strong>in the <span><strong><span>Amount Remaining</span></strong> </span><span> </span>field. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>After you save the alert, you will get an email stating, <span>&ldquo;Your alert is enabled. If your credit remaining for Azure in Open drops below $XX, we&#39;ll notify you&rdquo;.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>The system sends</span></span></span><strong><span><span><span> </span></span></span></strong><span><span>a separate email for each of the OSA keys associated with the subscription. Receiving multiple emails on the same day is normal if you have multiple OSA keys linked to the subscription and billing alerts enabled.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Customers receive their &quot;low credit&quot; Alert emails from&nbsp;<a href="mailto:billing-alerts-noreply@mail.windowsazure.com" target="_blank">billing-alerts-noreply@mail.windowsazure.com</a>. If there are issues regarding it, engage ASE.</p>

<h4><strong>Viewing OSA Key Information</strong></h4>

<p><span><span>Under the <span><strong>Credit History</strong> </span> tab, customers can view when an OSA key is set to expire. Keys are valid for 12 months and are applicable to any Azure service that uses monetary commitment.</span></span></p>
</div>

<p><span asset="4015637" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">4015637</span></p>

<h4><strong>Purchasing Third-Party Services</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Azure Marketplace, StorSimple, Azure Support Plans, <span>Active Directory Basic and Premium are prohibited</span> while using Azure in Open SKUs. </span></span></li>
	<li><span>In the Azure Marketplace, customers in Open licensing can transact all bring-your-own-license (BYOL) offerings and will need to associate a new subscription with a credit card for usage-based offerings</span></li>
	<li><span>Customers can purchase some Azure services through Open Licensing as per-user licenses on an annual term, separately. <span>Azure Active Directory Basic and Premium as well as Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS), are available in Open Licensing</span><span> </span><span> </span> and are examples of a per-user license purchased annually and separately. Some services are not available in all Datacenter locations. <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/status/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure Status</a> displays the services offered in each Datacenter.</span></li>
	<li><span><span>Customers can use AIO credits to deploy any VMs including third-party as long as it&rsquo;s Bring Your Own License (BYOL); i.e., credits used for computer and infrastructure costs, but not for licensing.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong></span><span><span>Customers can use their credits to pay for third-party services, but not at a discounted price.</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Customers cannot use AIO credits for third-party services which are usage-based. Therefore, the customer needs to purchase a separate Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) subscription in order to set up those services. In addition to this, AIO will only display marketplace items that are deployable. </span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><strong><span><span>Example 1:</span></span></strong></span> <span lang="EN-IN"><span>For third-party VM images like</span></span> <span lang="EN-IN"><span>Red Hat, billed as a Linux VM + Red Hat image</span></span>

		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li><span lang="EN-IN"><span>The customer can use a BYOL version of the Red Hat image, and they will receive a bill for the Linux VM through their AIO credits.</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong><span lang="EN-IN"><span>Example 2:</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-IN"><span> Oracle, which bills as a Windows Server VM + Oracle software</span></span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li><span lang="EN-IN"><span>The customer can use the BYOL version of the Oracle software (through Oracle License Mobility Policy), and they will receive a bill for the Windows Server VM through their AIO credits.</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong><span lang="EN-IN"><span>Pre-requisites:</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-IN"><span> The customer should have the licenses already purchased separately with the respective 3rd party service provider (Red Hat/Oracle)</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-IN"><span>.</span></span><span><span> </span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span><span>Customer purchases licensing seats.</span></span></strong>&nbsp;<span><span>Always check if the user has available tokens in CMAT if a customer has a question about licenses or seats (tokens purchased from the Volume Licensing Team). Seats are equal to $100 per seat and redeemable with AIO subscriptions. Engage your TA, and they will work with VL to resolve the issue if you don&#39;t see any available AIO tokens.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<h4><strong><span><span>Resend activation email</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>After a Distributor processes a customer&rsquo;s purchase request, the customer will receive an automated email with the following details:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>How to activate Azure in Open.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Purchases and the associated quantities.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>If a customer needs the email sent again:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>Suggest the customer to check their junk mail folder in case the email sent as spam.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>If the email is not in their junk mail folder, redirect the customer back to his or her distributor. &nbsp;</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> If the customer is still unable to receive the email, <span>engage your TA to get the email resent. For guidance on escalating internally to the One VL TA, reference </span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2929022" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2929022</a>. </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<div>
<h4><strong><span><span>Customer is unable to find OSA key in Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC) </span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>Customers receive a one-time use OSA Key when signing up for AIO. </span></span><span>These keys cannot be used on <span>multiple subscriptions or accounts. Once used, the status of the OSA Key changes to &quot;used&quot;. You can double-check the status of an OSA key in CMAT.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If customers are unable to locate their 5x5 OSA key in the </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/servicecenter/default.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">VLSC portal</a></span><span><span>, redirect them to their Distributor. The Distributor will also be able to assess any initial OSA key issues that occur when the customer first signs up.</span></span></p>
</div>

<h4><strong><span><span>OSA key does not work </span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>In some cases, a customer&rsquo;s 5x5 OSA key may not work properly during sign up or top off. The following issues may have occurred:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>The distributor provided the customer with the wrong key. </span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>A system issue prevented Azure from working properly with the Electronic Communications Information Technology (ECIT) token system.</span></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>In these instances, you should do the following to assist the customer:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>Verify the key status in CMAT by clicking <strong>Quick Access</strong> then <strong>Lookup Prepaid Card</strong>.</span></span></li>
	<li><strong><span><span>If the key is valid and not yet redeemed</span></span></strong><span><span>, escalate to your TA to generate a new key for the customer. </span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-2"><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: Because VLSC Support does not offer 24x7 support, the customer may need to wait until VLSC Support can respond. <span>ASMS </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>should proactively follow-up with VLSC Support on behalf of the customer. See the &ldquo;Engagement and Escalation Path&rdquo; section of this TSG for guidance on contacting VLSC.</span></span></p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><strong><span><span>If the key is valid, but already redeemed,</span></span></strong><span><span> redirect the customer to their Distributor. There are two ways to determine if a key was redeemed:</span></span>

	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li><span><span>Use the <strong><span>Lookup Token</span></strong> feature in CMAT. This will show the date the token was redeemed, and the VL Tenant globally unique identifier (GUID) of the entity that redeemed the token. You can then use the VL Tenant GUID to find more information about the redeeming entity by switching CMAT to the O365 view, clicking <strong><span>VL Information</span></strong>, then clicking <strong><span>Tenant GUID</span></strong>, then entering the GUID in the textbox and clicking Search.</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>View <strong>Monetary Credit Top-Off History</strong> and see if the customer already used that OSA key.</span></span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li><span><span>If the key is invalid, then redirect the customer back to their Distributor.</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-3"><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> For cases where we redirect the customer back to the distributor for OSA key issues, if the customer urgently needs a key and cannot wait for the distributor to respond, <span>then engage your TA who will work with the Visual Licensing Team to evaluate the situation and provide a replacement OSA key.</span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> Be sure to inform the customer that VLSC does not provide support 24/7 so there will be some wait time.</span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>Customer wants to extend the OSA key expiration date</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>If a customer wants to extend the OSA key expiration date, please inform them of the following: </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>OSA keys are valid for 12 months and expire after this timeframe. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Any unused balance is forfeited.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Customers cannot extend the expiration of an OSA key, so they should carefully forecast usage when purchasing keys to minimize the risk of forfeited funds.</span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>Customer cannot login to VL portal to purchase/view OSA key</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>A customer might experience difficulty logging into the VL portal when trying to purchase or view an OSA key (e.g., for topping off the subscription). Engage the One VL TA. They will evaluate the situation and determine how to assist the customer.</span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>Monetary credit amount contradicts the amount purchased</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>In some situations, a customer may find that the monetary credit applied to a subscription does not correspond to the amount the customer intended to purchase. Reasons for this mismatch may include a human error (e.g., the distributor mistakenly provided an incorrect OSA key) or a system bug.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If this scenario occurs do the following:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>Ask the customer to verify the amount documented in the customer&rsquo;s purchase confirmation email.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Verify the key status in CMAT.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>If the key is <strong>valid</strong> and shows the incorrect intended amount in CMAT, engage your TA, who can evaluate the situation and remedy it.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>If the key is <strong>invalid</strong>, redirect the customer to their distributor.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> In cases where the redirected customer urgently needs the OSA key and cannot wait for the distributor to respond, engage your TA, who can evaluate the situation and attempt to expedite a solution.</span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>Monetary credit amount contradicts currency exchange rates</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>Microsoft Azure is available in 89 countries; however, we currently support approximately 25 global currencies. Some customers credit amounts might not display in the currency in which they made the purchase. For example, a customer in the United Arab Emirates purchases 1000 AED worth of monetary credit, but the amount displays in USD (approximately $272) since Azure does not directly support AED.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The number of supported currencies is expanding; reference the </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/faq/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure Purchase FAQ</a></span><span><span> for a current list of supported currencies. Help the customer understand how the foreign exchange rate applies to their situation if a customer contacts Azure Support in this scenario.</span></span></p>

<h4><span><strong><span><span>Customer runs out of monetary credit and needs help with topping off</span></span></strong></span></h4>

<p><span><span>When a customer&rsquo;s monetary credit runs out or is running low, the customer may need assistance with &ldquo;topping off&rdquo; the subscription. &nbsp;In these instances, there are a few options to consider for assisting the customer:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>Have the customer contact their distributor for a new OSA key to top off the subscription.</span></span><br>
	<strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> This may take several days but is recommended because discounts might apply.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Have the customer add a credit card to their account to top off immediately.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span asset="4015634" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">4015634</span> </span></span></p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><span>You can issue a one-time courtesy $100 USD token (use the PID tool) for top-offs for customers that can&#39;t add a credit card (it&#39;s a small list of customers from Azerbaijan, Belarus, Brazil, Canada, Japan, Kazakhstan, Korea, Russia, Taiwan, and Ukraine). Customers in all other countries that support AIO should be pushed back to add a credit card and top off themselves.</span></li>
	<li><span>Work with your TA, who can issue a CPE credit in CMAT using the Misc. Credit feature (not a key).</span><span> </span><span> </span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Some customers may request to see a listing of top offs applied to a subscription during a specified timeframe. You can direct the customer to the </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://account.windowsazure.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure Account Portal</a></span><span><span> to retrieve top off information. This information is also readily available in CMAT, to find it click the <strong>clock icon</strong> which appears next to the Remaining Monetary Credit, and then review it with the customer.&nbsp; </span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><strong>Note: </strong>AIO top-off purchases are documented as receipts without the customer&#39;s VAT ID.</span></p>

<h4><strong>Credit/Refund Request</strong></h4>

<p><span><span>Credits and refunds for Azure in Open are identical to what&rsquo;s in place for all other offers, therefore engineers have permission to issue credits as per the standard policy: </span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>Engage your TA to either generate a Product ID (<span>PID</span></span></span><span><span>) key for the customer to add <strong>or</strong> apply the AIO credits via CMAT.</span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: Applying an AIO credit via CMAT <span>is the same as processing a credit to a standard Microsoft Online (</span><span>MOSP</span></span></span><span><span>) subscription and follows the same ASMS/BG empowerment rules. </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>For guidance on handling credit requests and refunds, reference <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646823" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2646823</a>.</span></span></p>

<ol start="2" style="list-style-type:decimal">
	<li><span><span><span><span>For time-critical AIO credits (such as &quot;top-off&quot; credits where a customer has approached their distributor for a new key but are at risk for subscriptions shutdown before the distributor will be able to provide them the new token), do the following: </span></span></span></span>

	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li><span><span>Instruct the customer to add a credit card and use the credit card top-off feature (see the AIO credit Top Offs section of this TSG). </span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>You can assist on top-offs if the customer is located in a country that does not support credit-card AIO top-off using the same process as above. </span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>If you need to engage your TA, the TA will generate a new key for the user if necessary using</span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3188143/azure-support-aio-key-generation" managed-link="" target="_blank"> TSG 3188143</a><span><span>. </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span><span>Keep in mind the key generation tool is tracked very heavily, so do not misuse.</span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In some cases, a customer might not be able to reach their distributor for a key and therefore proceeded to purchase monetary credits using their credit card. Afterward, the customer contacts the distributor and receives a key, and wants a refund for the credit card purchase.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Refunds in this scenario are discouraged but may be possible. It&rsquo;s discouraged because Microsoft prefers sales through distributors as the method of purchase. A best practice is to recommend that customers not purchase more on the credit card than they are likely to consume in the short term (i.e., when they can get a key from their distributor). If a credit card refund is deemed appropriate, <span>follow the standard credit process outlined in </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646823" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2646823</a><span><span>.</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p>Customers may ask for a refund for AIO tokens that they have purchased. If you receive such a case, advise them to engage the party that they purchased the AIO tokens from.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: Microsoft cannot process refunds for AIO tokens.</p>

<h4><strong><span>Customer wants to know how much they spent during previous months</span></strong></h4>

<p>For Azure in Open, rated usage only displays for the current month. Once the current month closes, the customer can only see the usage for a service without a rating. The customer cannot reconcile their usage to the remaining credits. The Universal Store Team (<span>UST</span>) does not store rated usage for closed months in any of their systems. In the example below, you can see the past billing statements show &ldquo;0&rdquo; rated usage.</p>

<p><span asset="4015638" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">4015638</span></p>

<p>If the customer experienced a Service Interruption Event (SIE) and credit is needed, you will need to reach out to AEO to access the previous months&rsquo; bills, or the customer can self-serve using <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4474330" managed-link="">ACM</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>AiO rating is now self serve via Azure Cost Management (ACM)</strong></h4>

<p>If you need to get the users usage rated, you can reach out to Azure Enterprise Operations (AEO) and they can run it for you.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><span><span>Customer needs a VLSC portal purchase invoice (This is for purchases made via a reseller only, not via Microsoft Credit Card (CC) top off)</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>When customers make a purchase on the VLSC portal, they will not receive an invoice automatically. Some customers will wish to have an invoice, and <span>contact support </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>for assistance.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If the customer purchased through a Distributor, then direct the customer back to the Distributor. Otherwise, we are unable to provide an invoice for the customer. </span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>Issues with the PDF receipt (this is for purchases made via CC directly from Microsoft only)</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span>Opening the PDF requires a password, which is the customer&rsquo;s Subscription GUID, as displayed in the portal in all lower-case letters. <span>If the password fails, send a <span asset="4498193" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4498193]</span> to the &ldquo;<strong>Azure in Open Escalations</strong>&rdquo; queue:</span></span><span> </span><span> </span></p>

<ul>

<h4><strong><span><span>Customer wants to transfer a balance to a new offer </span></span></strong></h4>

<div>
<p><span><span>Customers may have multiple subscriptions and may want to transfer monetary credits from one subscription to another. Unfortunately, we cannot fulfill this request due to system limitations. Use the standard processes to evaluate and issue a credit/refund, if applicable. Refer to </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646823" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2646823.</a></span></p>

<h4><span><strong><span><span>Customer wants to transfer balance from AIO to EA </span></span></strong></span></h4>

<p><span lang="EN">If a customer wants to transfer an AIO balance to an EA subscription, file a ticket to the EA team, using <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://Aka.ms/azurecreditpolicy" managed-link="" target="_blank">Credit Scenario 37</a>. </span><span><span> </span></span><span lang="EN">For more guidance, reference</span><span><span> </span></span><span> <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4094770/asms-ea-credit-request-tfs-ticket-process" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 4094770</a>.</span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>Customer applied AIO key to wrong AIO subscription</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>If you need to suspend an account in this scenario, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>Before suspending the &quot;wrong&quot; subscription, take a screenshot of CMAT showing the pending credits which the TA can reference. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Have the customer cancel the &quot;wrong&quot; subscription they used to apply the token.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Engage the TA to apply a credit to the &quot;right&quot; subscriptions up to your empowerment.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> you will need approval for anything over your empowerment per standard process.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<ol start="4">
	<li><span><span>When you engage your TA for credits, work with the customer to get the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; subscription de-provisioned at the same time. This is to ensure they don&rsquo;t submit another service request to re-enable it and use the credits.</span></span></li>
</ol>

<h4><strong><span><span>Customer purchases AIO token from the reseller and incorrectly spins up a new AIO subscription </span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>Customers may contact ASMS to transfer the credits from the newly created AIO subscription to the pre-existing AIO subscription (since the production deployments reside under the pre-existing subscription). </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>I<span>n these cases, </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>we will guide the customer to cancel the newly created AIO subscription after verifying the remaining credits and work with the TA to apply the remaining credits on the correct AIO subscription. <span>Follow the steps below to complete this action: </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>Once the TA applies the credits to the correct AIO subscription, you must deprovision the canceled AIO subscription. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Inform the customer you will be deprovisioning the incorrectly created AIO subscription. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Follow the standard process as outlined in </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646764" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2646764</a></span><span><span> to engage your TA to properly deprovision a subscription. </span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The <strong>Suspend - Immediate Cancel</strong> action in CMAT can also be used to cancel the subscription. The customer will not have to wait seven days to sign up for a new subscription. Upon performing the&nbsp;<strong>Suspend - Immediate Cancel</strong> action, add the following note in your case so the subscription is not re-enabled in the future:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>DO NOT re-enable this subscription &lt;Sub GUID&gt;. Cancellation was performed as the customer had activated the subscription incorreclty, and a credit was applied back to the actual subscription.</p>
</blockquote>

<div>
<h4><strong><span><span>Subscription Ownership Transfer (SOT, currently not supported by the Azure platform)</span></span></strong></h4>
</div>

<div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Customers may approach ASMS to move their AIO subscription from one Azure account to another Azure account. Currently, the SOT process of AIO subscriptions is not a support option under the Azure platform. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>One potential workaround is for the customer to create a new, empty AIO subscription in their desired destination account and then the customer and SE to work together to perform <span>Data Migration from the source subscription to the destination subscription.</span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> For guidance on how to perform data migration, reference </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2856526" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2856526</a></span><span><span> for simple migrations and </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2892044" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2892044</a></span><span><span> for forced migrations. </span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>Subscription transfer from a MINT account</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>If the customer already has a MINT account associated with their ID, they can&rsquo;t use that ID to obtain an AIO subscription</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span>. In these instances, we will need to do one of the following: </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Backfill the MINT account to become an OMS account.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Suggest that the customer use a new ID and create an OMS account.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><span><span>ART disables the customer&rsquo;s subscription &nbsp;</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>In some situations, the Account Research Team (ART) may disable a customer&rsquo;s subscription after discovering suspicious activity. In these instances, engage ART for assistance using the guidance in </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658538" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2658538. &nbsp;</a></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Azure in Open customers pre-pay for services, and their monetary credit remains valid during a dispute. If ART approves the customer&rsquo;s account, the subscription reenables, and the customer can continue using their monetary credit.</span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>Customer sees different data on different Azure portals</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span>Some customers might see different monetary credit information on the </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://account.windowsazure.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">account.windowsazure.com</a></span><span><span> portal vs. the </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">portal.azure.com</a></span><span><span> portal.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You can verify the monetary credit status in CMAT. However, if you too notice different data than what the customer reported, engage PayOps for further evaluation per the standard process. Reference </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2651579" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2651579</a></span><span lang="FR"><span> for guidance.</span></span></p>

<h3><a id="Engagement and Escalation Path" name="Engagement and Escalation Path"></a>Engagement and Escalation Path</h3>

<p><span><span>For Azure in Open scenarios that require additional assistance regarding pricing, OSA keys, top offs, or billing issues, you can engage the VLSC Support team directly in addition to engaging your TA:</span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><span><span>Reference the</span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/servicecenter/Help/Contact.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank"> VLSC Contact Us</a></span><span><span><span> page to locate the support contact in your region, or</span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>You can send a <span asset="4498193" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4498193]</span> to the <strong>Azure in Open Escalations</strong> queue for assistance.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1">The 4 core scenarios for AIO Escalation queue to respond to are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Customer did not receive their top-up invoice or are requesting previous invoices</span>

	<ul>
		<li><span>Same topic is where customer&rsquo;s are unable to unlock their invoices using the subscription GUID and an unlocked invoice is being requested</span>

		<ul>
			<li>
			<p>For this scenario, the core data required for any escalation task include:<br>
			SubGUID<br>
			Acct Owner ID:<br>
			Date of top-up purchase(s) customer is seeking the invoices on</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>Customer activated token (credits) on incorrect account or subscription</span>
	<ul>
		<li>For this scenario, the core data required includes:<br>
		Acct and SubGUID credits were redeemed against<br>
		Date of credit activation<br>
		Remaining balance of credit<br>
		Desired Acct and Subscription to align the credits to</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>NOTE</strong>: DO NOT cancel the current subscription until permission to transfer the credits is given. There are scenarios in which this request would be denied and therefore approval is required before any sub is cancelled</p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>NOTE 2</strong>: Upon receiving approval, current subscription must be cancelled to prevent the double the amount of credits from being consumed. In this scenario we are issuing a new token against the desired acct/sub which means the original token needs to be cancelled. This can only be done via suspension of the subscription.</p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>NOTE 3: </strong>If customer is unwilling to cancel the subscription, then credits cannot be transferred as there is no way to reduce the credit value manually</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Customer is requesting a detailed usage report </span>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>This scenario is already documented.&nbsp;This is an ASMS task to download the usage from CMAT.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Note</strong>: If you need AIO usage rated, work with the AEO team.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>Customer is requesting a credit for impacted service (i.e. system bug)</span>
	<ul class="indent-1">
		<li>
		<p>For this scenario, the core data required includes:<br>
		Acct Owner ID<br>
		SubGUID<br>
		IcM / Technical ticket that investigated the issue &ndash; must include Root Cause Analysis (RCA) findings<br>
		Justification for credit<br>
		Credit policy the issue falls under<br>
		Date Range of Impacted Service<br>
		Impacted Service<br>
		Value of refund with calculation file:<br>
		Calc file should be isolated down to date range and for specific service only &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Calc file should include all raw data for usage but be pivoted/filtered by the above criteria</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>For all other scenarios, follow standard TA escalation paths. </span></span></p>

<p><strong>TA Adds Incorrect Token Amount to Account</strong><br>
In this scenario, engage PayOps, who will work with Engineering to correct&nbsp;the amount.</p>

<p><strong>Billing Alert Notifications</strong></p>

<p>Customers may submit a support request to ASMS if they miss their billing notifications. Use ICM to verify the team to validate the request:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Assigned team ownership: C+E AIP / CIP-CCMApi</li>
	<li>Email address (internal use only):&nbsp;<span><span><a href="mailto:ccmapidevs@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">ccmapidevs@microsoft.com</a></span></span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Additional Billing Alert Notification Information</strong></p>

<p>By default, low account balance notifications are<strong> not</strong> sent to the Account Administrator.</p>

<p>As part of the AIO signup process, the email entered in the &ldquo;Partner Contact Email&rdquo; field is the only email address which receives low subscription balance notifications.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The customer can add additional email IDs via the Accounts Portal / Alerts tabs.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>These emails are notified of credit remaining and expiry.</li>
		<li>Each alert can be sent to two email addresses.</li>
		<li>These alerts are created at the subscription level.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Azure in Open Billing alerts include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Token Credit Remaining:</strong> Remaining token balance is less than or equal to 30% of the initial token balance.</li>
	<li><strong>Token Expiry:</strong> 30 days until token expiration date. After the expiration date, any unused credit will be lost.</li>
	<li><strong>Subscription Credit Remaining:</strong> Total subscription credits remaining is less than or equal to the configured amount.</li>
</ul>
