<h3><span><span><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. What is Speak Up!?</span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Speak Up! is a forum that enables support advocates and engineers worldwide to provide Microsoft with direct, closed-loop feedback on all aspects of their experience, including support guidelines, procedures, content, tools, products, and training.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Speak Up! can be accessed by visiting <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://aka.ms/speakup" managed-link="" target="_blank">aka.ms/speakup</a> or the full address: </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/SpeakUp" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/SpeakUp</a> </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Speak Up! relies on your experienced use of Microsoft content, procedures, guidelines, and products to suggest ways to make them better. You are empowered to provide direct feedback and engage in a two-way discussion on suggested changes and improvements.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>What happened to Speak Up! Express? </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In March 2020, Speak Up! Express was deprecated along with the previous Speak Up! site. It has been replaced by <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/SpeakUp" target="_blank"><span>https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/SpeakUp</span></a>. You can still send us all your great feedback about our content, just be sure to include the KB number! </span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Speak Up! process</span></span></h3>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Consumer</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> advocates can submit any type of feedback from an error or a gap, or if they have a new idea to improve content, guidelines, procedures, products, or training. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Commercial</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;advocates can submit feedback regarding internal Microsoft content. Additionally, some sites and Lines of Business have begun routing feedback for other topics, such as Commercial Escalations or Windows Technical Support. If you are unsure what you can submit feedback about, simply check the New Item form to see if your topic is listed as a Category for you to choose (if you don&rsquo;t see it, that means that topic is not in scope for you yet).</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Search <span><span><span>the Speak Up! site for similar items. Vote these up and add your comment to increase their <span>impact</span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span> (to do this, see <a bookmark-id="3.2" href="#3.2" managed-link=""><span>section 3.2</span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span>).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span></span></span>If you don&rsquo;t find a similar item, create a new one!</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Microsoft&nbsp;moderators, including our content owners, review and respond to new submissions, providing clarification if the information already exists or identifying items needing more work.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If more information is needed from you, the item&rsquo;s status will be set to <strong>Open - Additional details required from advocate</strong>. If there is no response from the submitter within about two weeks, the item will be closed but can be reactivated with the new information at any time.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>When an item is answered or a change is complete, the status will be updated to best reflect the action that was <span>taken</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>, and you will receive an email to notify you of this change.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Some items may be redirected to a more appropriate path when necessary, such as engaging team leads for access issues or tool failures.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>You can still comment and vote on resolved items, and these items can be reopened at any time, as needed.</span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span><span><a id="5" name="5"></a>5.&nbsp;FAQ</span></span></h3>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What is Speak Up!?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Speak Up! is a SharePoint Online-based platform that enables support advocates and engineers to provide Microsoft with direct feedback on content, guidelines, procedure, tools, and training.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: If I enter a feedback at the wrong location, what happens?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Our moderation team will respond or re-categorize as needed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Who is looking at my Speak Up! item once submitted?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> A Microsoft moderation team reviews and responds to all submissions. Site leads may also review items from their site for training purposes.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How long does it take to look at a submission?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The moderation team has an initial response goal of 48 <span>hours</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can advocates comment or request additional information once an item has been resolved?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Yes!&nbsp;You can always provide additional feedback, even after a submission has been resolved. You can do this by leaving a comment on the Speak Up! item itself, or you can email&nbsp;<a href="mailto:SpeakUpModerator_ProgramManagement@service.microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">SpeakUpModerator_ProgramManagement@service.microsoft.com</a>&nbsp;(if you do this, include the Speak Up! ID number as a reference).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I remember the New Item form being a lot shorter. What happened? </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>:&nbsp;You are likely remembering using Speak Up! Express; this was a &ldquo;light&rdquo; version of Speak Up!, and was previously available in our prior toolset. This has been replaced with our current tool, which rolls Speak Up! and Speak Up! Express all into one location, making it even easier to keep track of your items. You can still use the form the same way you would before; be sure to include your KB numbers, and feel free to attach any images or documents that might help.</span></span></span></span></p>
