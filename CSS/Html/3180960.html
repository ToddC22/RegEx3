<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Program-level out of scope guidance</h3>

<p>Note that the following topics are considered out of scope at the program level for BOS:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Adult advertisers.</li>
	<li>Language translation and localization.</li>
	<li>Work requiring advocates to log into non-Microsoft products and services (such as Google Ads) due to privacy concerns.</li>
	<li>System/tool limitations inherent to each service.</li>
	<li>Making any modifications directly to advertiser accounts without explicit direction or approval from requestor.</li>
	<li>Providing service for accounts who are currently in bad standing with Microsoft Advertising (for example, credit hold and QBR penalties).</li>
	<li>Any services that are not listed on the AES Menu of Services, but out-of-scope requests are considered on a case-by-case basis and may be handled with a stated turnaround time that is outside the normal.&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>See KB </span></span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4473076" managed-link="" target="_blank">4473076 AES: Policy: Microsoft Advertising: Out-of-Scope Request Guidelines</a><span><span><span> for guidance.</span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Out of scope requests are considered on a case by case basis and may be handled if the following requirements are met:
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li>You believe&nbsp;can&nbsp;execute the request based on detailed instructions provided by the requestor.</li>
			<li>You have&nbsp;bandwidth to complete the request, adjusting SLA as required.</li>
			<li>There are no tools or system blockers.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Any customer&nbsp;in non-supported AES markets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Auto-response and request acknowledgement</h3>

<h4><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1 Auto-response</h4>

<p>If a request is successfully submitted via email to BOS, the requestor will receive an automatic ASD response email stating the following:</p>

<p><span asset="4495496" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4495496]</span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="2.2" name="2.2"></a>2.2 Request acknowledgement</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>You should send a request acknowledgement email within <strong>24 hours</strong> of ticket submission if:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The request will take longer than 24 hours from submission of the ticket to process.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>You need more information or clarification to complete the request. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span>It is not always necessary to send an acknowledgment email if you know that you are able to complete the request within <strong>24 hours</strong> of submission and you already have all the information you need to do so. </span></span></span><span><span><span>The Request Acknowledgment Email should contain the following:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Request acknowledgement </span></span></strong><span><span>&ndash; A general acknowledgment of the request</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Clarification/Information request (Optional)</span></span></strong><span><span> &ndash; Any clarification or information needed to complete the service.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Service Level Agreement (SLA)</span></span></strong><span><span> &ndash; The amount of time needed to complete the work.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Best practice:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> It&rsquo;s always a good idea to thoroughly review a request to ensure that:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>All the information needed to complete the request is provided.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You believe&nbsp;that the request can be completed within SLA.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="2.3" name="2.3"></a>2.3 To: and CC: lines</h4>

<p>In some instances, requests may include additional contacts in their email communications or in their submission request. It is <strong>critical</strong> to ensure that everyone on the <strong>to: </strong>and<strong> cc: </strong>line remain included in email communications when replying. Always use <strong>Reply All</strong> when replying in email.</p>

<h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Emails, attachments, and child tickets</h3>

<p>The following provides guidelines on how emails, attachments, and child tickets should be handled for requests from account managers/coordinators vs. services (frontline) advocate requests:</p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="3.1" name="3.1"></a>3.1 Email communications</h4>

<p><strong>Account managers/coordinators:</strong></p>

<p>Only the original ticket owner should be communicating with the requestor to prevent any confusion.</p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Handling multiple-tactic requests:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If multiple-tactic requests are received in the same email, a new parent service request (SR) should be created for each tactic <strong>immediately</strong>. <span lang="EN-GB">However, communications relating to each individual tactic should be sent from the main SR to avoid sending multiple emails to the requestor. Proper communication between the main SR owner and the other PT owner should be followed so that pushbacks and other information are communicated in a timely manner.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Example</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>: When the request is to propose and then upload Sitelink Extensions, you are responsible for creating a new, separate ticket, and provide the new case number for the upload portion of the work to the requestor. You must send a separate email communication and proper documentation in the ASD Case Notes</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Services (frontline) advocates:</strong></p>

<p>All communications should take place in ASD case notes per child ticket.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Inform the Services (frontline) advocate that an update is waiting for them by adding a <strong>brief note in the parent ticket</strong>,<strong> </strong>and advise them that the AES ticket has been updated. Do not ask questions or engage in discussion via parent ticket notes. When you update ASD notes, don&rsquo;t delete the existing notes. Place your latest notes at the top of the case notes thread, to allow for easier visibility when reviewing in the tool.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>: To properly document the ticket activity, separate the email communication and the ticket activity documentation, still following the cadence discussed above. This will make the communication professional, as well as avoid any confusion of information. See <span><a bookmark-id="10" href="#10" managed-link="">section 10</a>,&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>Documenting requestor engagement,<span> for further details</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="3.2" name="3.2"></a>3.2 Attachments</h4>

<p><strong>Account managers/coordinators:</strong></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Proposal file</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: The final output (proposal) file, which is to be sent to the requestor, must only be sent through the parent ticket via email attachment, or&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>the </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/backoffice/Very%20Large%20File%20Share/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewpath=%2Fteams%2Fbackoffice%2FVery%20Large%20File%20Share%2FForms%2FAllItems.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">Very Large File Share</a><span><span><span> if greater than 10MB.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Downloads/working files: If multiple BOS advocates are involved with any given request, their work should be attached to their respective child tickets via email to </span></span></span></span><span lang="PT"><span><span><a href="mailto:capattach@microsoft.com" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US"><span><span><span>capattach@microsoft.com</span></span></span></span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>. This includes but is not limited to proposal, skipped, or error files</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span>Attachments with any customer data and personal data must be encrypted.</span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><strong>Services (frontline) advocates:</strong></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Proposal file/download/working files:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The final output (proposal) file, which is to be sent to the requestor, should be sent via </span></span></span><a href="mailto:capattach@microsoft.com" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US"><span><span>capattach@microsoft.com</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> so that the requestor can pick this up from the tool. Files greater than 10MB should be shared via the </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsofteur.sharepoint.com/teams/backoffice/Very%20Large%20File%20Share/Forms/AllItems.aspx?viewpath=%2Fteams%2Fbackoffice%2FVery%20Large%20File%20Share%2FForms%2FAllItems.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">Very Large File Share</a><span><span><span>. This includes but is not limited to proposal, skipped, or error files. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>: For Monthly Invoice, any information containing customer legal documents should be shared using the Data Transfer Management (DTM) link</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="3.3" name="3.3"></a>3.3 Child tickets</h4>

<p><strong>Account managers/coordinators:</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Create child tickets for every +1 account number/XID request you receive from an Account Manager/Account Coordinator (for example, if you are asked to work two XIDs, you would handle one XID in the parent SR and one XID in a child SR).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The child tickets&nbsp;should be created immediately upon receipt of the parent SR request. This will ensure the SLA is being tracked for each XID individually and ensure accurate SLA reporting.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The owner of the parent ticket is responsible for collating the work that is attached in child tickets to create the final output (proposal) file.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If you review the parent SR request and you are <strong>unable to begin processing</strong> the request without further clarification from the account manager/coordinator, then you may <strong>temporarily delay</strong> </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> the creation of child SRs until the necessary clarification has been provided. Document the reason behind the delay of the ticket creation. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>See <span><a bookmark-id="10" href="#10" managed-link="">section 10</a></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>,&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>Documenting requestor engagement<strong> </strong><span>for further details</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>If only selected accounts need further clarification with the requestor, you should only delay the child ticket creation for the affected accounts. Then&nbsp;continue to create child tickets and work on the remaining accounts. This will ensure request continuity and accurate SLA reporting.</p>

<p><strong>Services (frontline) advocates:</strong></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>N/A. The request is submitted via a single child ticket. If the frontline advocate submits multiple requests in one child ticket, please follow the above AM/coordinator guidelines and ensure that we are creating extra tickets on behalf of the frontline advocate to document the back office work motions. Do not pushback for this reason. </span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 ASD coding guidelines</h4>

<p><strong>Opening a case:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Go to the <strong>QVIEW</strong> tab in ASD. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>In the <strong>QVIEW</strong> dropdown, select your site-specific view.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Locate the <strong>Owner Name</strong> column and select the <strong>Sort</strong> button to display the full list of assigned tickets.

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Find the ticket that you will work on and check the <strong>Customer Email</strong> column to see who submitted the request.</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>If it is a <strong>Parent ticket</strong> and the email address ends with @microsoft.com, the request is from an internal Service Team member (for example, an Account Manager/Account Coordinator) who is representing the advertiser (such as, v-john@microsoft.com or johnsmith@microsoft.com).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>If it is a <strong>child ticket</strong>, the request came from a vendor Service Team member (for example, MAST Service or Support advocate) who is representing the advertiser (the alias in the <strong>Customer Email</strong> column will be an external alias, such as, john@customeremail.com).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Right-click the ticket you wish to work and select <strong>Edit</strong> to open the AES incident form. </span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: If the ticket is not in editable, navigate to the bottom of the ASD form and select <strong>Edit</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Check that the SR number is already created and present on the bottom portion of the form.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Complete the incident form (ticket). See steps below for how to do this.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Completing the incident form (ticket): </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Going in order from top to bottom, complete the required fields of the incident form (ticket).</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>You will not be able to move to the next field until you fill out the form in the proper order.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-2"><span><strong><span><span><span>Important</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Be sure to select <strong>Product</strong> and <strong>Advocate Type</strong> first! This will ensure that you are taken through the correct coding workflow for Back Office Support.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Select the following options in the <strong>Reason for Contact</strong> section:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Product</span></span></strong><span><span>: Microsoft Advertising</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong>Advocate <span><span>Type:</span></span></strong><span><span> BackOffice</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Program:</span></span></strong><span><span> Advertiser Enablement Services</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Customer Issue:</span></span></strong><span><span> Select the appropriate code to match the request.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Topic</span></span></strong><span><span>: Select the appropriate code to match the request.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Solution Delivered:</span></span></strong><span><span> While the ticket is being worked, select <strong>Solution in Progress</strong>. Once you have completed the work and are closing the ticket, update with the appropriate code that describes what service you completed. If you execute more than one service for a request, create and code separate tickets.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>The appropriate request code is outlined under <strong>ASD Coding Guidelines</strong> in this article.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;3. When filling out the fields of a child ticket, use details in the Parent ticket to complete the form:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Primary Target Market:</span></span></strong><span><span> Fill out the market that&rsquo;s noted in the parent ticket.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Account Number Available?:</span></span></strong><span><span> Select <strong>Yes</strong></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><a id="4.3" name="4.3"></a>4.3 AES requestor segment and AES market fields</h4>

<p>The individuals responsible for ticket assignments should review the Microsoft Advertising AES form to ensure that the <strong>AES</strong> <strong>market field </strong>is populated. This will determine who will handle languages such as English, German, Portuguese, Spanish, Dutch, and French.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the submitter used the email submission template and was not able to provide the full details, you can verify the Segment and Market in the UCM Dashboard for the particular account.

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>This step is particularly important for multi-language teams to determine which BOS advocate should be assigned to any given request</span></span></span></span>.&#8203;</p>

<p><strong>AES requestor segment:</strong></p>

<p>The<strong> AES requestor segment </strong>field should be used to identify which segment a request is coming from.</p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Within the ASD form, the <strong>Number of Accounts, Campaigns,</strong> and <strong>Ad Groups Treated</strong><em> </em>fields should be used to identify how many accounts, campaigns, and ad groups have been worked on per ticket.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Accounts Treated</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> is the most important of these fields, and should always be filled out in the parent ticket in the format of the total accounts treated minus one. This number should match the number of child tickets that are created. For example, if you have one parent ticket and 20 child tickets, the number in that field should be 20. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>These fields are mandatory. For data accuracy and calculation purposes for campaigns and ad groups, we ask that a minimum value of <strong>1 </strong>be entered. This is not applicable for Accounts Treated where there are no child tickets, this should be left at 0. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For campaigns and ad groups:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a request is made at CID level and involves multiple accounts, you will still need to update the campaign or ad group per the below instructions.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a request is made at the campaign level (for example, sitelink extensions), the <strong>Ad Group Treated</strong> field should be set as<strong> 1</strong>. This is the same when handling requests at the account level.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a request is made at the ad group level, the <strong>Campaign Treated</strong> field is based on the number of campaigns associated with the requested ad groups. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For BOS services, such as invoice account setup and reporting requests, which do not involve work at either the campaign or ad group level, populate both fields with 1.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>We also have maximum values, which we should not exceed:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Campaigns should not be entered higher than 10,000.</span></li>
	<li><span>Ad groups should not be entered higher than 200,000,000.</span></li>

<h4><a id="6.2" name="6.2"></a>6.2 Use of Microsoft Teams</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>You may encounter scenarios where it is most efficient to communicate with the submitter via an online instant messaging tool, such as Microsoft Teams. In such instances, you must copy and paste the conversation into the ticket case notes once the conversation has ended. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>When to use Teams: </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>When after reviewing the ticket assigned, you have questions and clarifications that we need answered to proceed with the request. You can chat immediately with the requester to get a quick answer.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>When after 24 hours of sending the acknowledgment email with pushback and clarification items, you have not received any reply from the requester.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Guidelines around using Teams:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>For multiple SRs, same request, same requester: To avoid too many contacts and requesters getting multiple messages, a POC will be assigned. The POC will be responsible for contacting the requester through Teams to clarify the needed information.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Keep the communication professional. Comical font types, sizes, and colors should not be used.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Do not communicate through Teams if the requestor&rsquo;s status is:</span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span>In a Meeting</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>In a Call</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>In a Presentation</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Do not Disturb</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Offline</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>To comply with privacy and security policies, the following outlines the approved usage of IM:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong>Permitted use of IM</strong></span></span></span></span><strong>:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You can use Teams with requesters, but both parties must use their Microsoft alias or v-account.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>You may use IM for quick questions or clarifications on a ticket (such as campaign budget, over-length text ads, negative keywords, time zone, and targeting) or to reach out when the submitter is nonresponsive to emails</span></span></span></span>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Not permitted use of IM: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You are not allowed to use IM to receive or send files, or share their desktop to share files that contain personal data (including but not limited to, XID, and SAP IDs).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You cannot use Windows Live IM to chat with submitters.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Submitters should not initiate an IM to express urgency or open tickets with you. If this occurs, notify a supervisor</span></span></span></span>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Best practice</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: You can send a quick recap to the submitter by highlighting the agreed instructions/clarification for the request.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><a id="6.3" name="6.3"></a>6.3 Total case ownership</span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></h4>

<p>In a Total Case Ownership model, the submitter should only be in direct communication with one person, the case owner. Internally, if work is distributed to additional advocates to meet SLA, the submitter should not be made aware. The following provides guidelines when handling very large requests, additional information and status updates, and unresponsive requestors.</p>

<p><strong>Very large requests</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>When handling very large requests, it is especially important that you provide submitters with a sense of ownership and confidence in our ability to process their work. It is also <strong>critical</strong> that the information and updates we provide to requestors will allow them to clearly and easily communicate updates with their customers and plan for service completion around the SLA we provide. Use the <strong>AES_Work_In_Progress</strong> template.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>For all updates relating to large request handling, ensure you follow this guidance:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Inform the requestor why more time will be required (if applicable) and provide an updated estimate for how long it will take to complete the work.</span></li>
	<li><span>Work with the requestor to determine the cadence of updates to be provided (if deemed appropriate by you and the requestor) and establish if a single output file is to be provided or whether the current/complete work should be provided at each update stage. </span></li>
	<li><span>Provide completion status updates every 48 hours (such as, <em>&ldquo;We have processed X out of XX many accounts&rdquo;</em>). If the request itself should take more than one week, and the requestor is aware of this SLA from the start, then updates should only be provided once per week.</span></li>
	<li><span>Always set a next action for when you will follow up again, regardless of the SLA.</span></li>
	<li><span>Always ask clarifying questions as soon as possible, to avoid additional delays in processing.</span></li>
	<li><span>Inform the Microsoft BOS Technical Advisors (<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:sbosesc@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">sbosesc@microsoft.com</a>) of the encountered scenario for visibility. </span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Additional information and status updates</strong></p>

<p>You may encounter scenarios in which they need to follow up with requestors to either:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ask for additional information.</li>
	<li>Provide status updates.</li>
</ol>

<p>For either scenario, follow-up should take place within two&nbsp;business days or within a time period agreed upon by the requestor (for example, in one week if the Account Manager is away for vacation).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Use the <strong>AES_Out_Of_Office</strong> template. In the event that a requestor is out of office for a prolonged period of time (one week or greater), review their out of office message to see if there is an alternative person that you may be able to work with until the requestor returns from leave.</p>

<p><strong>Unresponsive requestors</strong></p>

<p><span>In the event that a requestor becomes unresponsive after two follow up attempts (spanning four business days), send a closing email on the<sup> </sup>fifth day to the requestor stating that they did not hear back from them and they can re-engage with AES for any service request they have. The two follow up attempts should take place on the second and fourth business days<span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Use the <strong>AES_Unresponsive Response</strong> email template from ASD. If the request is only completed partially, provide the survey link. If no work has been done yet, the survey link should be removed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="6.4" name="6.4"></a>6.4 Requests from non-Microsoft domain emails</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>As a reminder, the BOS team is an internal support team and only offers support to members of the Microsoft Advertising salesforce and other frontline advocates servicing Microsoft Advertising customers. If a request has been received from a <strong>non-Microsoft domain email address</strong> (such as @contoso.com), it will be closed automatically as <strong>Cancelled </strong>when it<strong> </strong>is not possible to know who the requestor is. If this happens,<strong> </strong>inform the requestor of the following:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we cannot accept requests from non-Microsoft email domains. Please resubmit your request using your Microsoft email address and we will be more than happy to help. Otherwise, you can contact </span></span></span></em><span><span><span><a href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-advertising-support" target="_blank">Microsoft Advertising Support</a>.&quot;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Where it is possible to identify the requestor from the non-Microsoft domain as a member of the Microsoft account team, then update the alias in ASD to their Microsoft email and proceed with the request. Also let the requestor know that they submitted with their personal email and to ensure for next time that they are not logged in with this before submitting. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>In instances where the requestor added a non-Microsoft domain email address, either in the &ldquo;To:&rdquo; or in the &ldquo;cc:&rdquo;, you must inform the submitter that the non-Microsoft domain contact was removed and ask them to provide the Microsoft email address of this contact to include them on the next email communication</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="8" name="8"></a>8. Customer data security requirements</h3>

<p>Customer data protection is important to Microsoft and every effort must be made to protect personal data and its collection or processing using appropriate security measures.</p>

<p>All classifications of data require a &#39;medium&#39; level of data protection, which should be achieved through encryption any time the content is <strong>emailed,</strong><em> </em>whenever possible. High Business Impact (HBI) content must be locked regardless of storage or transit -- most internal systems are only Medium Business Impact (MBI) secure by default and emails are susceptible to interception.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Standard AES tactic work shared via output files does not need to be password protected. This does not contain personal data.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>See </span></span></span></span>KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3174641" target="_blank">3174641 Microsoft Advertising: Handling Personal Data team guidance</a><span lang="PT"><span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3174641" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US"></span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span><span> for details on data classification</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span>Any documents containing personal data or account data must be encrypted with a password <strong>before</strong> they are relayed via email to any other internal team or system.

<h4><a id="10.2" name="10.2"></a>10.2 Chat transcript attachment</h4>

<p>The following provides guidelines on when and how to attach a chat transcript on parent or child tickets via ASD.</p>

<p><strong>When to attach:</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If you were able to converse with the requestor through the Skype/Teams tool, they are required to attach the chat transcript in real-time to each of their child/parent tickets via ASD. This is to either relay any clarification/pushback regarding the request or alert if there was an additional request or special instruction provided by the requestor.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>How to attach chat transcript:</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>To properly document&nbsp;every interaction or communication that transpired between the advocates and the requestors using the Skype/Teams tool, you must always attach the chat transcript on each of their tickets provided that they meet the conditions stated above. Here is the step-by-step procedure on how to attach chat transcript via ASD:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the ticket in ASD.</li>
	<li>After the Skype/Teams conversation has ended, select all texts by pressing <strong>CTRL + A, </strong>then press<strong> CTRL + C</strong> to copy.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Case Notes</strong> in ASD.</li>
	<li>Press <strong>CTRL + V</strong> to paste the chat transcript in the <strong>Chat Transcript</strong> section.</li>
	<li>Update the <strong>Next Steps/Resolution Summary </strong>section, if necessary.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Complete</strong> in ASD once done.</li>
</ol>

<h4><a id="10.3" name="10.3"></a>10.3 How to separate email communication and case notes in ASD for frontline service or support requests</h4>

<p>To properly document the ticket activity,&nbsp;separate the email communication and the ticket activity documentation (case documentation). This will make the communication professional as well as avoid any confusion of information (for example,&nbsp;multiple ticket stamps). See below is the step-by-step process:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open and edit the assigned L1 or child ticket.</li>
	<li>Edit any necessary fields.</li>
	<li>Go to the <strong>Case notes</strong> section on the left navigation panel in ASD.</li>
	<li>Copy and paste your email communication above the L1 notes, using a separator if needed.</li>
	<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Complete</strong>.</li>
	<li><strong>Reopen</strong> and <strong>Edit</strong> the ticket again.</li>
	<li>Select the <strong>Case notes</strong> section, <strong>delete</strong> the old email communication and <strong>replace</strong> it with your new case notes.</li>
	<li>Select&nbsp;<strong>Complete</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When updating ASD case notes, email communication should be retained in a thread form, except for the case documentation. Make sure to place your latest communication at the top of the email thread to allow easier visibility when reviewing in the tool. Any communications will not be removed since these had been previously stamped in the ticket.</p>

<h3><a id="11" name="11"></a>11. Reopening tickets</h3>

<p>If a requestor has contacted BOS regarding a closed ticket, the existing ticket should be reopened, but only if it has been closed for less than seven&nbsp;business days. If the ticket has been closed for more than seven business days, a new parent ticket needs to be created.</p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Important</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: You are responsible for creating the new parent ticket and shouldn&rsquo;t ask the submitter to create a new request.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="12" name="12"></a>12. Conducting proactive outreaches for advocate errors</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>If an error is identified while reviewing tickets and it directly impacts the client&rsquo;s Microsoft Advertising account (for example, account-related issues such as keyword capitalization preferences and non-ticket related issues such as coding), you will be assigned to conduct a proactive outreach and offer to correct the mistake.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>The following messaging is used by a team manager or to coach communication with the requestor as the first step of the proactive outreach:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Hi {Requestor Name},</em></p>

<p><em>I&rsquo;m {Name} from the Back Office team. As part of our quality monitoring program, we review tickets on an ongoing basis to ensure our advocates can meet the needs of requestors.</em></p>

<p><em>We have found an error on your request {Ticket Number}. The error is {insert detailed, specific outline of the transgression}. The impact to your client is {detail impact]. To resolve this issue, we recommend {insert detailed recommended restitution steps}. Would you like us to proceed?</em></p>

<p><em>If you do, we will have an advocate assigned to your request and have the issue correct as soon as possible.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you,</em></p>

<p><em>{signature}&rdquo;</em></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> In instances where an advocate forgot to include supplementary information, such as a skipped filed for upload requests, the missing information can be provided to the requestor without asking for the issue to be resolved. In instances where only minor rework is required, the error can be corrected and proactively resolved, instead of asking the requestor if the rework should be done.</p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="12.1" name="12.1"></a>12.1 Ticket creation and follow up cadence</h4>

<p>A new parent ticket is expected to be created for the proactive outreach by the team manager or coach, even if the original request was documented in a parent or child ticket. Re-assignment of the ticket to an advocate should only take place after a request to have the mistake corrected is received.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Whenever possible, it is recommended that the new parent ticket be assigned to the advocate working on the original request. This will enable them&nbsp;to learn from their mistake.</p>

<p>If no response is received after the first contact attempt, one additional follow up should be sent 48 hours from the time of the initial proactive-outreach email. The following message&nbsp;can be used in a follow up communication:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Hi {Requestor Name}, </em></p>

<p><em>I wanted to reach out once more to see if you would like assistance in fixing the error identified by our quality monitoring program.</em></p>

<p><em>Please feel free to reply or reach out to AES using {Segment Specific Alias} and we&rsquo;ll be more than happy to help.</em></p>

<p><em>Thank you,</em></p>

<p><em>{signature}&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>If no response is received after an additional 24 hours, close the new ticket.</p>

<h3>13. Escalating to Global Support and Mission Control</h3>

<h4><a id="13.1" name="13.1"></a>13.1 Escalations for Global Support</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>If a technical issue is encountered for a Microsoft Advertising account or a Microsoft Advertising Tool (such as Editor, Intelligence, or UCM), escalate to Global Support by submitting a ticket </span></span></span>to <a href="mailto:adsupport@microsoft.com" target="_blank">adsupport@microsoft.com<span lang="EN-US"></span></a><span><span><span> and inform your manager/supervisor of the issue encountered.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Managers/Supervisors should inform <a href="mailto:sbosesc@microsoft.com" target="_blank">mailto:sbosesc@microsoft.com</a> of the encountered issue for visibility.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Escalations should be raised from the ticket-level you are already working from, depending on the requestor. Do not create additional child tickets. </span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Example: An Account Manager (AM) request would be escalated from within the parent SR, while a CSS L1 request would be escalated from within the child SR.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
