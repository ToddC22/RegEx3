<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview">Overview</a></h3>

<p>Marketplace provides a space for publishers to promote and sell their applications and services to Azure customers who are building custom applications in the cloud. Customers can quickly discover, evaluate, and purchase solutions that are compatible with the Microsoft Azure Platform.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> By June 2019, all Marketplace purchases will exist on the <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/betaazureSM/ASMS%20Supportability/Modern%20Billing%20Platform.aspx">Modern Billing Platform</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>SaaS Fulfillment API v2 is now available. More information is available <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace/partner-center-portal/pc-saas-fulfillment-api-v2">here.</a></li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="_Hlk496687051">Policy </a></h3>

<ul>
	<li>If a bill is&nbsp;generated&nbsp;for testing, customers and publishers receive a refund,&nbsp;according to the&nbsp;<a href="http://aka.ms/azurecreditpolicy">Azure Credit Policy</a> (Scenarios 1, 6 and 38).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>All Marketplace specific support should be conducted using Commerce Support Tool (CST).</li>
	<li>For legacy subscription ownership transfers, CMAT will still be used with an updated backend that will alert users of any blocks of the SOT.</li>
	<li>During the transition period, there may be a need to use both CST and CMAT, depending on the state of the customer.</li>
	<li>Requested refunds which date fall before the customer&#39;s cutover date must be processed using CMAT while refunds after the cutover date must be processed in CST.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Always engage ASE first when you are asked to engage ACE (unless there is an emergency).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Do not use the ASE template as a way to open IcM tickets to any other team. ASE is not the same as IcM.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="_Hlk496687128">Customer Experience and Provisioning </a></h3>

<p>Marketplace customers (once moved over to Modern) will have a slightly different Ibiza experience:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Similar to Reserved Instances, a Marketplace SaaS purchase will create an Asset that is not linked to a Usage Asset (Azure Subscription).</li>
	<li>Azure Marketplace and Reservations on the Invoices tab will show the customer&#39;s subscriptions with Marketplace consumption (with usage download options) and invoices. <strong>Note: </strong>This does not include pre-Modern invoices.</li>
	<li>All Marketplace purchases, including no cost, free services, will show on a given month&#39;s invoice.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>For instance, if a customer has only purchased free Marketplace services, they will receive a $0 invoice on the fifth of the following month for the current month&#39;s purchases.<br>
		<strong>Note</strong><strong>:</strong> This is a significant change from the current experience; these customers do not receive invoices for free Marketplace services.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A billing group will automatically be configured for each subscription under a customer&rsquo;s account (only after it has been cutover to Modern).</li>
	<li>An asset will be created for each subscription-based Marketplace purchase.</li>
	<li>A usage rating asset (that ultimately represents the Azure subscription) will contain the usage-based Marketplace services and will have Dev Services/Marketplace SaaS assets linked.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Due to Marketplace&#39;s recent cutover to Modern, customers will no longer be able to see past Marketplace charges within the Ibiza portal. &nbsp;If the customer requires a record of the past charges, please escalate the request to PayOps to have a document generated.</p>

<p><strong>Update PO Number on Billing Profile</strong></p>

<p>Modern customers have the ability to self-serve updating their Purchase Order (PO) number on their Billing Profile.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Navigate to the <strong>Cost Management + Billing</strong> blade.</li>
	<li>Select the <strong>Billing Profiles</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Click to select the Billing Profile you wish to update.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>Properties</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Update PO Number</strong>.</li>
	<li>Input the desired PO number.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Update</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios">Support Scenarios&nbsp;</a></h3>

<h4>Using CST or CMAT</h4>

<p>Follow the steps below to determine if the customer has been cutover to Modern:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Search customer profile in CST:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>If the customer does not show up, use CMAT.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Identify Usage Asset related to the subscription used to purchase Marketplace:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>If Usage Asset doesn&rsquo;t exist, use CMAT.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Identify Rating Asset to which Usage Asset is connected.</li>
	<li>Locate<strong> thirdpartyChargesState</strong> in the Rating Asset:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>If the state is not &ldquo;Enabled,&rdquo; use CMAT.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span asset="4493618" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4493618]</span></p>

<p><strong>Identifying charges on a credit card</strong></p>

<p>Modern Marketplace charges are not clearly identified on the customer&#39;s credit card statement. The invoice name is not identified on the customer&#39;s statement. It is identified on the statement as &quot;Microsoft.&quot;</p>

<p>If a customer asks to have a charge identified, look up the customer in CST using their Account Admin email address.</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: When viewing customer charges in a different Billing Group Name, you will only be able to see all Billing Group Names when you look up the customer through their Account Admin email address.</span></span></p>

<p>If a customer is unable to view&nbsp;the Pay Now option, provide the customer with the following&nbsp;link:</p>

<p>https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/PayNowBlade/invoiceId/&lt;invoiceID&gt;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> &lt;invoiceID&gt; will be replaced with the invoice the customer is attempting to pay.</p>

<h4>Subscription Ownership Transfers (SOT)</h4>

<p>While the policies of supporting Marketplace purchases do not change, one large benefit for both customers and support of the Modernization is that the majority of Marketplace purchases will no longer block subscription transfers.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A SOT cannot be performed on a Modern subscription if there is a Free Trial in the destination. For details, see&nbsp;<a data-auth="Verified" href="https://nam06.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Finternal.support.services.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fhelp%2F3040383&amp;data=02%7C01%7Cv-ishan%40microsoft.com%7C74b45f784b0b4001966608d866439520%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C637371787738149426&amp;sdata=SbIF6ARDuSsFvTPcMiz8%2BoVOjMVc5t5iRneVYMfqSZo%3D&amp;reserved=0" originalsrc="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3040383" rel="noopener noreferrer" shash="aI1uXiXr21zwpRsWhrKR1TJLoWKyWL9RWXoZr+ICpD8WawUSi2jObbOo3hkv8HooTUIPaTmHewPYpyrWEw+epOefVfvLcAuPSrNhHwEfmFerqfDjZVej0AbW2ofYQH1Fplxpyydh/bijoTbyOof4wH1AK1OF0z7W71nqgwaW2kM=" target="_blank" title="Original URL: https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3040383. Click or tap if you trust this link.">TSG 3040383</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Linked assets must move with the usage rating asset (during a subscription ownership transfer or between projects).</li>
	<li>Marketplace SaaS products will be Assets and can be viewed both through customer self-serve and through the Modern support tooling, CST.&nbsp;You will not need to check Gumshoe for Marketplace purchases, as all Marketplace consumption and subscription-based purchases will also appear in CST.</li>
	<li>For Legacy SOT, CMAT and self-serve will do all the necessary eligibility checks, and once approved in the program, the transfer system will include all associated Marketplace assets (e.g., Dev Services/Marketplace SaaS purchases) in the transfer.</li>
	<li>Marketplace resources that cannot be transferred will receive the following error&nbsp;message: <em><strong>&quot;ErrorCode:ProductNotAvailableDueToStopSell&quot;</strong>.</em>&nbsp;<br>
	This error will appear&nbsp;if the product version is not available. It does not&nbsp;necessarily mean that the product is completely unavailable. In these cases, in order to process the transfer, the customer can upgrade to the available version of the product in the Azure portal by doing the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Navigate to the Azure portal.</li>
		<li>Click <strong>Create a resource</strong>.</li>
		<li>Enter the name of the marketplace item in the &quot;Search the marketplace&quot;&nbsp;field.</li>
		<li>Once the results are displayed, click on the &quot;Select a software plan&quot;&nbsp;dropdown to upgrade to an available product version.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>After doing this, the&nbsp;customer does not have to delete the marketplace service for the above error.</li>
			<li>In cases where the marketplace service is not available anymore, the search will not give any results and the customer must delete the resource.&nbsp;<span>In these situations, engage the Marketplace team using <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://portal.microsofticm.com/imp/v3/incidents/create?tmpl=6L104z." managed-link="" target="_blank">this IcM</a>.</span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4>Obtaining Marketplace Invoice</h4>

<p>Marketplace consumption usage can be downloaded by the customer through Ibiza and by Support Engineers in CST on a given month&#39;s invoice.<br>
<br>
For a legacy customer, each subscription used to purchase Marketplace services will be tied to its own Billing Profile/Billing Group. Therefore, each subscription will have a separate Marketplace invoice. Each invoice will include all Reservation and Marketplace purchases made under the subscription.</p>

<p>For example: A customer has three subscriptions under their account, and the account has migrated to Modern Marketplace. In this case, the customer will receive/notice the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>They will receive three separate invoices on the following month if they make a Marketplace purchase on each of the subscriptions.</li>
	<li>They now have one invoice for each subscription&#39;s Marketplace/Reservation purchases.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: All purchases will be displayed under the same <em>Commerce/Customer Root</em> in CST under different Billing Profiles.</p>

<h4><br>
Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)/Cloud Partner Portal (CPP) for Modern Marketplace</h4>

<p>Modern Marketplace will allow CSP customers to purchase marketplace offers.<br>
<br>
Confirmation of CSP opted-in services on Marketplace can be performed by the CPP Support team. To engage CPP, send a task to the&nbsp;<strong>Azure Marketplace &ndash; Publisher Tier 1 </strong>queue with the routing product Azure Marketplace Publisher v2.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>CPP does not&nbsp;<span>support end user Marketplace issues. They only support publishers listing to the Marketplace via the Cloud Partner Portal (CPP). </span></p>

<p>A given service can be viewed with access to the Cloud Publisher Portal:</p>
