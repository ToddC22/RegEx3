				<li><span>A customer calls about an issue where they are trying to share and collaborate on a Word document with Word 2007. We convinced the customer to upgrade to Microsoft 365 as it provides co-authoring features, and other added value such as OneDrive storage.</span></li>
				<li><span>A customer contacts support with a Windows XP or an Office Legacy version (for example, Office 2003) with an issue not related to activation.

<h3><a id="4" name="4"></a>4.FAQ about Consult Outcome</h3>

<p><strong>Q: How should I code the consult outcome for an issue with Outlook.com and/or OneDrive.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>These Microsoft online services include support known as In-App support. Within the user interface of these services, there is an option where customer can submit a request for support. The consult outcome should be coded as <strong>Redirect</strong>.&nbsp;If the customer has an issue with the OneDrive App after it has been installed, direct them to in-app support. Steps can be found in KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3126549" managed-link="" target="_blank">3126549 Procedure: Office: OneDrive - Consumer Support Boundaries</a></li>
	<li>If it&#39;s an issue where the customer is not able to send/receive outlook.com emails from a desktop mail app (for example, Mozilla Thunderbird, and Outlook 2007), then a paid offering is expected. The outcome of the service offer will help you determine the proper consult outcome code</li>
</ul>

<p>If it&rsquo;s an issue specific to a web browser, and troubleshooting can be conducted&nbsp;then a Paid offering is expected. The outcome of the service offer will help you determine the proper consult outcome code</p>

<p>For detailed information on how to code Outlook.com or OneDrive issues that are being redirected to in-app  support see the following KB:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="MsoNoSpacing">KB&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/2919054" managed-link="" target="_blank">291054 Procedure: Office: Outlook.com - Consumer Support Boundaries</a></li>
	<li class="MsoNoSpacing">KB&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3126549" managed-link="" target="_blank">3126549: Procedure: Office: OneDrive - Consumer Support Boundaries</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span>Q: How should I code the consult outcome for an issue with Windows XP, Vista, or Office 2003?</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span></span>These products are no longer supported. The first aspect to determine is if this an activation issue. Even though these products are no longer supported, there are exceptions if it&#39;s related to product activation (see <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/2458477" managed-link="" target="_blank">KB 2458477</a> to understand products supported for activation). If it is, then code the consult outcome as <strong>DIA</strong>. If it&#39;s not related to product activation, it should always be <strong>New Product as Solution. </strong><span><strong> </strong></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><span>Q: If a customer has an Assure subscription, and they have a Windows XP issue that is not related to product activation&nbsp;can I use Assure Support?</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span>No. Despite the subscription, Windows XP is no longer supported. The consult outcome should be </span><strong><span>New Product as Solution. </span></strong></p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><span>Q: If a customer has a non-genuine product? How should I code the issue?</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>A: </strong>I<span>t&#39;s important to capture further details of the scenario. We do not expect or require for you to check if the product is genuine on every call or chat. You may have proceeded with delivering support to the customer with one of the codes listed in the above (<strong>Assure, One-Time Paid</strong>, </span><strong><span>Download, Install, Activate &ndash; No Charge).</span></strong><span> However, if early diagnostic and questioning&nbsp;suggest that the customer is using a non-genuine product, then the appropriate code should be <strong>New product as solution.</strong>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>For example:</span></p>

<p> </p>

<ul>
	<li>The symptoms describe an issue that appears to be a&nbsp;malware infection. You complete a sale of Assure&nbsp;and deliver support for the customer. During troubleshooting, you discover that their Windows is non-genuine. You educate the customer that they are a victim of software piracy. The consult outcome is <strong>Assure Support</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A customer tells you that they just had their friend install Windows on their PC. They are also not able to activate. You ask for licensing details (product key) and discover that it&#39;s a non-genuine product. You educate the customer that they are a victim of software piracy. The consult outcome is <strong>New Product as Solution</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span>Q: After some troubleshooting, I discovered and concluded that the customer has a hardware failure (for example, bad hard drive). I redirect the customer.&nbsp;Should I code the consult outcome as Redirect?</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span>No. A consult outcome does not mean it&#39;s a troubleshooting outcome. Before you proceeded with troubleshooting&nbsp;a proper consult outcome should have already been set (</span><strong><span>Download, Install, Activate &ndash; No Charge, Assure, One-time Paid Support, Microsoft 365 Post Install Support). </span></strong><span>Even if a redirect is required after troubleshooting was completed, the consult outcome should never be changed to <strong>Redirect.</strong></span></p>

<p> </p>

<p> </p>

<p><strong><span>Q: How should I code the consult outcome if the customer has an issue with their Microsoft account?</span></strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span>Microsoft account issues are part of the list of issues where no-charge support can be delivered. The consult outcome is </span><strong><span>Download, Install, Activate &ndash; No Charge. </span></strong><span>The full list of no-charge scenarios:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span> Microsoft account issues</span></li>
	<li><span>Any Store app issues (including games). These are issues with apps that are offered via the Windows Store. This can include download, install, and usage issues.</span></li>
	<li><span>Any Microsoft hardware peripherals (keyboards, mice, Wireless Display Adapter, Webcams, Headsets, Gaming Controllers)</span> </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: How should I code the consult outcome if the question/issue is related only to launching Windows Defender and its functionality?</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> It should be coded as DIA unless it is related to virus infection. If it is a virus infection, it should be a paid scenario.<p>
