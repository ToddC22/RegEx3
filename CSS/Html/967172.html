	<li><span class="text-base">Exchange Fulfillment (EXC FO)</span> &ndash; a paid or free-of-charge order for accessories requiring the customer to send the item to the service center before the replacement is returned. The inbound shipping method depends on the country. However, if the customer is required to pay for shipping, we ask that they use a traceable means, such as FedEx or UPS, so that we can ensure that the item is received by the service center. Items sent without tracking cannot be confirmed received by the service center.</li>
	<li><span class="text-base">Send Immediately Fulfillment (SEN FO)</span> &ndash; The service center sends the accessory directly to the customer. This may be a paid or free-of-charge order, usually dependent on the console&rsquo;s warranty status.</li>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note 1 </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><strong>-</strong> Czech Republic and Slovakia Hardware repairs are administered through Teleplan.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note 2</strong> <strong>-</strong> For Norway only, the 5-year warranty covers any defects not considered to be reasonable &ldquo;wear and tear&rdquo;. In addition, it excludes deliberate or accidental miss-use, tampering, unauthorized modification, reverse engineering, and any other exclusions stated in the original terms of use previously accepted.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note 3</strong>&nbsp;<strong>-</strong>&nbsp;For Australia, consumers have rights to repair, replacement or refunds in certain situations, refer to</span></span></span> <span lang="EN-AU"><span>KB </span></span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4100081" target="_blank">4100081 Guideline: Microsoft and the Australian and New Zealand Consumer Law</a>.</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>Microsoft has determined having regard to the nature and cost of the product that Xbox has a consumer guarantee of at least two years after the initial purchase.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note 4</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> <strong>-</strong> Australia and New Zealand consoles previously indicated a 1-year express (manufacturer) warranty, supplemented by a statutory warranty, one implied by law and separate from the express warranty. Because there are no set periods of coverage required by the law, <strong>internally</strong>, this warranty is considered valid for 730 days (2 years) from date of purchase of the Xbox console. Some consoles sold later automatically reflect the full two-year warranty coverage. Consoles indicating a 1-year warranty that expired less than a year ago may be eligible for a courtesy repair with proof of purchase. </span></span></span>See KB&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3099337" target="_blank">3099337 Procedure: Australia/New Zealand customer demands remedy for a defective product or service</a>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note 5</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>-&nbsp;</strong>New Zealand and Singapore: For Xbox accessories purchases,&nbsp;refer the customer to the retail point of purchase and the retailer should exchange the defective unit for them.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

If a customer contacts support after receiving their upgrade to Xbox One S and is reporting they are no longer able to use their Kinect but are now asking for a Kinect adapter, follow the steps below to validate customer is eligible for it. We should not process an order for the customer prior to them receiving the Xbox One S and they will need to contact WIC to process the exchange.</p>

<ol>

Example customer scenarios for advocate guidance:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>A customer contacts CSS and has a broken controller that needs to be replaced. Advocate confirms,&nbsp;no prior SEN has been created for this customer, and then creates a SEN for a standard controller.</li>

	<li>Same customer contacts CSS an hour/day/week/month and complains about a broken chat headset. Identify that customer has not had a SEN for a headset and create a SEN for a headset.

<p><span><span><span><span>The Xbox Original Elite Wireless Controller&nbsp;&ndash; Gears of War 4 (GOW4) Limited Edition has sold out and reached its end of life.

Customers who are eligible for an in-warranty claim can be offered to select one of the following two options:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p role="document"><span><span><span>For customers in warranty, they have these two&nbsp;options below.</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li>A full refund of the purchase price of the controller</li>

<ol start="2">
	<li>An Xbox Original Elite Wireless Black Controller and $60 in CSV applied to the customers Microsoft account</li>
</ol>

<p role="document">For customers outside of 90-day warranty - standard exchange and no CSV (<strong>requires return of broken device before customer is sent a replacement, US/CA only</strong>)</p>

<p role="document"><strong>Customer Impact/Experience:</strong><br>
Customers may express frustration about not being able to replace their GOW4 Limited Edition controller. Be sympathetic to their situation while helping them understand that this controller was only a limited edition with limited number of parts. Microsoft is eager to get the customer back to gaming and is offering these two options&nbsp;to expedite their gaming experience.</p>

<p role="document"><strong>Advocate Impact/Experience:</strong></p>

<p role="document">If the customer chooses option 1 - Follow standard refund process.<br>
If the customer chooses option 2 above:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Inform the customer that CSV is available to use for up to 1-year to purchase digital goods on the Xbox store or Windows Store.</li>
	<li>Process the controller exchange via MST.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Select the SKU <strong>81550 (Products) - Xbox One - Wireless Controller - GOW4 Elite - EXC - No Charge.</strong></li>
	<li class="indent-1">Inform the customer they will need to send in their broken GOW4 Elite controller and once it is received, we will ship out the replacement Elite Wireless Black Controller.</li>

	<li class="indent-1">In-warranty accessory procedure is exchange only &ndash; no longer applicable for North America unless the customer has already received one SEN replacement per product.</li>
