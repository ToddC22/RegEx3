<h3 class="kb-symptoms-section section"><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</h3>

<p>Customers with a Surface device may report that their device is cracked or damaged without them dropping or mishandling the device. Under normal circumstances, most cracked screen and physical damage scenarios indicate damage that is customer induced. This type of damage is not covered under the terms of the warranty. Repair or replacement of these devices requires an out of warranty payment or an accidental claim against a previously purchased Microsoft Complete plan.</p>

<p>There are some situations however where the exchange center may make an exception if the customer declares no drops or mishandling took place.</p>

<p>When the customer reports physical damage or cracked screen with a qualifying Surface device, you will see in warranty offers under Cracked Screen Exception and Physical Damage Exception in your SOM tool with the below message:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Cracked screen and physical damage are considered customer induced and not typically covered under warranty. For customers claiming accidental damage (i.e., dropped their device), use the Out of Warranty or Accidental Damage claim offers (if applicable). If the customer states they did not cause the damage (i.e., did not drop or mishandle the device), use the In-Warranty Exchange offer. Remind the customer that the device will be inspected and will be returned to them unrepaired if the damage suggests it was customer induced damage.&rdquo;</em></p>

<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Known device issue exceptions</h4>

<p><span><span>This article should be used whenever your SOM tool directs you to, and the following provides details on some of those exceptions.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Surface cracked screen reported</strong></p>

<p>Laptop 3 13 in. and 15 in. all colors and configuration. We have investigated claims of screen cracking on Surface Laptop 3 and have determined that, in a very small percentage of cases, a tiny but hard foreign particle may cause a hairline fracture in the glass that may seem to appear unexpectedly or without visible cause.</p>

<p>Customers that are experiencing this issue can contact our Microsoft Support team to initiate a repair free of charge during the warranty period of the device.</p>

<p>Customers that have previously paid Microsoft for a Surface Laptop 3 repair that they believe experienced this issue, may contact Microsoft Support customer support to learn about reimbursement.</p>

<p>See <a bookmark-id="3" href="#3" managed-link="">section 3</a> <span><span> </span></span>for more information.</p>

<p><strong>Surface Duo exceptions</strong></p>

<p>If a customer reports a damaged/non-working hinge or a cracked screen, follow the below guide and table to determine the appropriate repair options for the customer.</p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If the customer states there is a cracked screen but claims they did not cause the damage, select the Cracked Screen Exception or Physical Damage Exception to allow the device to be sent in for evaluation. Make sure the customer knows that the device will be reviewed and will only be covered in warranty after the damage is assessed. If the damage is determined to have been caused by the customer, then it will be returned to the customer as is. They will have to submit another request and pay the out of warranty fee to replace the device.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. FAQ</h3>

<p><strong>Q: Why do only some devices qualify for this exception?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft has identified a small subset of devices that may become damaged as the result of manufacturing defects. These devices vary and will be systematically qualified by your SOM tool.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What if a customer claims the damage to the device was not customer induced but does not qualify for this exception?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A: </strong>If the qualifying message and offer is not available, the only option for the customer is an out of warranty exchange.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I have paid before for a cracked screen on my Book, Laptop 2, or Pro, (non-Laptop 3) and I want my money back.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A: </strong>Tell the customer that this is only observed with Surface Laptop 3.</p>

<p><strong>Q: How long will this issue be covered?</strong></p>

<p>A: This issue will be covered during the warranty period of the device.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I paid for a Laptop 3 cracked screen previously and want a refund.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> Validate the customer has not already received a refund. Ask the customer how the damage occurred on their device. If the customer admits to damaging the device, they will not qualify for a reimbursement. If they have not received a refund and meet the criteria, proceed with an in warranty offer.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What happens if I ship my device in and additional damage is found?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> You will be notified by email that your device is not eligible for warranty support and your device will be returned to you. If you choose to pay for out of warranty support for a fee, you can create a new service request.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I&rsquo;ve had this issue and would like to get a refund for my device instead of an exchange.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A: </strong>Refunds are only authorized during the return period. If you are within the return period, you can contact the retailer/place of purchase. If purchased from Microsoft Stores, we can do the refund on behalf of Microsoft Stores. See KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4514977" managed-link="" target="_blank">4514977 Procedure: Surface: Services Exchange and Repair Offers Overview</a> for Standard exchange see section 1.2 or Advanced exchange see section 2.2. We can provide an exchange, free of charge for the remainder of the warranty period.</p>
