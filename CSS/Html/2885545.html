<h3>What is this article about?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>How you should handle customers who are not the account owner or user but are the payment instrument (PI) owner.</p>

<p>This is applicable to every customer interaction when the customer calling is not the account owner but is the PI owner and does not know any other account details. These are customers who only know the PI and know no other account details. If the customer is the account owner or knows account details, this procedure does not apply<span>. </span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Do not attempt to search for the customer&rsquo;s account by the payment instrument (PI) when obtaining the PI information via chat or phone advocates who are working from home (WFH).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Suggested scripting for chat and phone advocates who are WFH directing customers to contact phone support for payment search:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em>We value the security of your payment information which is why we ask you not to share it through this chat conversation. We would like to resolve your issue by performing a payment information search. Our phone support can safely and securely handle your payment information. Would you like me to help you request a call from them?&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customers requiring assisted support for billing and account management or save, and retention scenarios may not be the Microsoft account owner or user but are the PI owner. Some examples may include:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>A parent who has allowed their PI to be associated to their child&#39;s account and has a question about a transaction.</span></li>
	<li><span>Someone </span><span><span><span><span><span><span>who is calling on behalf of a deceased Microsoft subscription member and wants to cancel a subscription.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span>Someone who is not a Microsoft customer, does not have a Microsoft account, has not let their PI be used on a Microsoft account and has fraudulent charges.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h3><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Guideline</h3>

<p>Customers who are the PI owners can receive assisted support even if they are unable to pass account verification. If the&nbsp;customer cannot pass account verification:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span>The assisted support options are limited to information about transactions.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Note: </strong>Advocates should not be taking any action on an account including removal of a payment instrument if the caller cannot show they are the owner of the account.</p>

<p class="indent-1">Instead, ask customers to report unauthorized use of a PI to their financial institution and work with them to put the account on a hold and potentially have a new card issued if it has been compromised.</p>

<p class="indent-1">Removing the card is not the best way to limit the customer&rsquo;s liability and prevent future purchases, below are some of the reasons:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">When an advocate removes a PI from an account, there is nothing to prevent the account owner from simply adding the card back.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">The payment instrument owner has no guarantee that the PI is not being used for purchases from other merchants.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">The customer is still liable for current and future charges unless they have reported the unauthorized use to the card issuers.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span> You cannot provide any additional account details.</span>&nbsp;If the customer wants to perform other account management activities, such as updating the account information, wants a refund, or wants account details, the customer must pass verification<span>.</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1">When assisting <span>PI </span>owners, there are a few guiding principles to follow:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span>If the&nbsp;PI owner has a relationship with the account owner (for example, parent or other family member), be sure you are helping the customer understand the importance of being able to manage and access their child&#39;s account. Refer to KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4338531" managed-link="" target="_blank">4338531 Procedure: Return/Refund: Unauthorized purchase by a family member/known person</a>.</span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span>Let the customer know that if the <span>PayPal account </span><span> </span>is removed, we will be unable to assist with any charges or refunds against that PayPal account from this Microsoft account in the future as re-adding the same PayPal account as PI will not be recognized as the same PI unlike other forms of PI.</span></li>

<h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3.&nbsp;Procedure</h3>

<div class="alert-band">
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-24">
<p><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Important</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>: Do not code the root cause as &quot;Customer cannot pass verification&quot;, instead select the appropriate root cause.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span><span>Determine if there is a relationship between the <span>PI </span> owner and the account(s) located by asking the following questions:</span></span></p>

<p>1. Do you or anyone in your household have a Microsoft account or use a Microsoft subscription (for example, Microsoft 365, Xbox Live, or Xbox Ultimate Gamepass)?</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Yes</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>, go to step 4.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>No</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> go to the next step.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>2. Have you ever given your PI information to anyone to use on a Microsoft subscription?</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Yes</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>, go to step 3.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>No</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>, the customer has fraudulent charges. Do not attempt to verify the customer. Follow KB </span></span></span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/928204" target="_blank"><span><span><span>928204 Procedure: Fraudulent or unauthorized Microsoft account charges</span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span> to resolve the customer&rsquo;s issue.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>3. Are you still in contact with the account owner? </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Yes</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>, go to the next step.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If they no longer have contact with the account owner or the relationship is broken, do not try to verify the customer&rsquo;s account. If the customer requests to remove the PI, read the note under step 4 that refers customers to their financial institution.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>4. Use the suggested messaging&nbsp;below to tell the customer what their support options are. Help the customer understand the benefits of having control of the account and what the support limits are if the customer is not verified: </span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong>Messaging:</strong><span><br>
<br>
<em>&quot;I can assist in reviewing your transaction history. To protect the account owner&rsquo;s information, I won&rsquo;t be able to provide any additional account details. We will need to verify the </em></span><span> </span><em><span>account.&quot;</span></em></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Active subscriptions on unverified accounts cannot be modified by design, including changing renewal options or removing the PI. If the account owner is not available to verify the account, direct the caller to their financial institution. This is intended to prevent leaving the caller with a potentially compromised PI.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><span>If you are unable to verify the customer, select the <strong><span>Tools</span></strong> option, select<strong><span> Transaction History </span></strong>to review transactions. If requested, provide the customer with the detail of the purchase.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><strong>Note</strong>: </span>If you are unable to verify the customer, use the&nbsp;<strong>Back to Customer Search&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Back to Search</strong>&nbsp;option to start a new search and view the&nbsp;<strong>Transaction History</strong>&nbsp;as stated above (<strong>Tools/Transaction History</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><br>
<span asset="4483145" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4483145]</span>&nbsp;<span asset="4483146" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4483146]</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Note</strong>: The only time you should enter the email address is if you are unable to find any Microsoft account linked to the PI. If this happens, ask for the customer&#39;s email address so it can be linked to the case as an email account.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span asset="4483147" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4483147]</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>You will not be able to send an email to the&nbsp;PI&nbsp;owner if you cannot verify the account. Follow the customer management process, understand that you will be sending information to the account owner who may be affected by the&nbsp;PI&nbsp;removal.<br>
<br>
See below for specific support boundaries for different customer scenarios:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong>Customers calling on behalf of a deceased Microsoft account owner</strong>: Be sensitive to the customer since this can be an emotional call. If the caller is unable to pass account verification and only knows the PI information, refer them to their financial institution to close &nbsp;the PI. If they want to access or close the Microsoft account, refer to&nbsp;the Next of Kin process at&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/article/accessing-outlook-com-onedrive-and-other-microsoft-services-when-someone-has-died-ebbd2860-917e-4b39-9913-212362da6b2f" target="_blank">Accessing Outlook.com, OneDrive and other Microsoft services when someone has died</a>. </span></span></li>
	<li>
	<div>
	<div><span><strong>PI owners who are not Microsoft customers and have fraudulent charges</strong>: If a customer calls in with charges on their PI but is not a Microsoft customer and has not enabled their PI to be used by someone who is a Microsoft customer, the customer will not have to pass account verification. Because these are considered fraudulent charges by someone who has accessed the customer&rsquo;s PI and created a Microsoft account to make fraudulent charges, the customer has no way to access the account through account verification. For more information about how to handle this scenario see KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/928204" managed-link="" target="_blank">928204 Procedure: Fraudulent or unauthorized Microsoft account charges</a></span> (section 2.1).</div>
	</div>
	</li>
	<li><span><strong><span>PI </span> owner is related to the account owner (such as a&nbsp;child, husband, wife, cousin, or&nbsp;grandparent):</strong> The best support scenario is for the customer to be able to pass account verification, so we help the <span>PI </span>owner learn how to get access to the account and manage the account in the future. If the customer cannot pass account verification, you can assist the customer with managing the <span>PI </span>and reviewing transactions. Note that the customer can call us back later for refund review even if we&rsquo;ve removed the <span>PI</span>. Account verification is still required to review and issue refunds.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>PI</strong> </span><strong>owner is a friend of the account owner:</strong> If the customer cannot pass account verification, you may assist the customer with<span>&nbsp;</span>reviewing transactions. If the caller wants to do any additional account management activities, they will need to have the account owner contact support or be able to pass verification.</li>
	<li><strong>PI owner has a &quot;broken&quot; relationship with the account owner:</strong> Examples of this include ex-spouses, ex-boyfriends, ex-roommates, or other relationships where the PI owner cannot easily reach the account owner. If the customer cannot pass account verification, you may assist the customer reviewing transactions only. If the caller wants to do any additional account management activities, they will need to have the account owner contact support or be able to pass account verification or ask them to contact the financial institution for further help.</li>
