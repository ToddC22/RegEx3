<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>This article provides instructions on how to change your customer&rsquo;s payment instrument (PI) on their Azure account.</p>

<p>Most of the credit card edit options are self-serve. If your customer is working with a credit card, direct them to the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card" managed-link="" target="_blank">How to add or update a credit card on Azure</a>&nbsp;<em>OR&nbsp;</em><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" data-linktype="relative-path" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/delete-azure-payment-method" managed-link="" target="_blank">Delete an Azure billing payment method</a>&nbsp;webpage first. If your customer still has difficulty with credit cards, assist them further once they have tried the steps in the links above.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Debit cards ar no longer accepted as valid PI. Direct your customers to <span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-troubleshoot-declined-card" managed-link="" target="_blank">Troubleshoot declined cards</a> </span>for additional guidance.</p>

<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a><strong>Policy</strong></h3>

<p>Your customer must enter their new payment instrument into the <a aria-live="assertive" data-bi-name="content-anchor-link" data-content-id="" data-content-type="" data-linktype="external" href="https://portal.azure.com/" managed-link="" tabindex="0" target="_blank">Azure Portal</a>&nbsp;before making a request to switch payment instruments.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>If there are no alternate payment instruments available, you will not be able to switch payment instruments for your customer.</li>
	<li>Ask your customer if their new payment instrument is for one subscription, a group, or all subscriptions on the account.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong>After switching payment instruments in CMAT</strong>: Any outstanding balance on the account will be charged to the new payment instrument provided the below conditions are met: </span></p>

<ul>
	<li>I<span><span><span><span><span>f your customer is switching from <strong>credit card</strong> to <strong>invoice</strong>, any outstanding balance from the credit card will move to their invoice. Once on the invoice payment method, your customer cannot go back to credit card payments on that subscription. To stop invoice billing for a subscription, they will need to start a new subscription using a credit card and then perform a data migration from the old subscription to the new one. Global Financial Services (GFS)&nbsp;might ask the customer to settle the charges on a credit card if the risk check fails before enabling the invoice option. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If your customer is switching from <strong>credit card</strong> to <strong>credit card</strong>, any outstanding balance from the old card will be pushed to the new card and the new card will be charged immediately.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span><span>:</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span> A balance transfer will fail if there are more than 20 open balances. In this case, the customer must settle charges on the old card before switching PI, or you must engage PayOps who will credit the charges on the old card and charge the new card.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the destination credit card has been used on the account previously, check in CMAT for any <strong>Declined Transactions</strong> and the <strong>Decline Count</strong> (under the <strong>Charges</strong> tab) to see if the destination credit card is already in a dunning cycle. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Do not change to a credit card that is already in dunning and is declining previous charges. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If your customer wants to <strong>remove an old credit card</strong> but wants the subscription to continue running, they must first add a new credit card and then switch the payment instrument for the subscription to the new credit card.</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p>They can then remove the old credit card via the&nbsp;<a data-linktype="external" href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure portal</a>. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/change-credit-card#change-credit-card-for-a-subscription-by-adding-a-new-credit-card" managed-link="" target="_blank">Change credit card for a subscription by adding a new credit card</a>&nbsp;for detailed steps.&nbsp;<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Note:</strong> The Remove Payment Instrument option in CMAT should not be leveraged by the SE to remove a credit card. Credit card removal is a self-serve option performed by the customer.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your customer has a subscription on the Invoice mode of payment but cannot switch their payment instrument from a credit card to invoice on another subscription under the same account, it is likely the credit limit has been reached and needs to be increased. In these scenarios, engage the GFS team following the guidelines in&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2927087" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2927087</a>.</p>

<div>Also when charges are Pending and a Payment Instrument is updated on a customer&#39;s account, the charges will immediately settle once the card is updated. This will cause the next invoice generated to display this settlement information on the credits line instead of appearing in the Total Amount Due. This is the expected behavior.</div>

<h4><a id="Ukraine Customers" name="Ukraine Customers"></a><strong>Ukraine Customers</strong></h4>

<p>Online Services customers in Ukraine require a countersigned original hard copy of the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/subscription-agreement/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Online Subscription Agreement</a> (MOSA). This is a legal requirement. The online version of the MOSA is not enforceable in Ukraine and is null and void there.</p>

<p>Ukrainian law does not recognize electronic licenses; a license agreement must be in writing. Under Ukrainian banking regulations, one of the documents which should be presented to the bank as a condition to purchase foreign currency is an agreement drawn in a form compliant with the Ukrainian regulatory requirements. This means that banks may refuse a print-out of an online contract which has not been physically signed by both parties and does not bear their stamps. If a license agreement is not in writing, it is null and void by the virtue of Ukrainian law.</p>

<p>The process for providing a hard copy MOSA to a customer is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Your customer places an order through the Azure Portal.</li>
	<li>Your customer will receive notifications to submit the signed MOSA to Microsoft.</li>
	<li>Your customer should print, sign, and mail the MOSA to Microsoft:<br>
	<br>
	Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited<br>
	The Atrium Building<br>
	Block B, Carmanhall Road<br>
	Sandyford Business Estate<br>
	Dublin 18</li>
	<li>When Microsoft receives the MOSA, they will countersign, stamp and date the MOSA and send it back to the customer.</li>
	<li>If the customer does not send a signed MOSA back to Microsoft within 15 days (after payment), their subscription will be disabled.</li>
</ol>

<h3><a id="Customer Experience and Provisioning" name="Customer Experience and Provisioning"></a><strong>Customer Experience and Provisioning</strong></h3>

<p>Instruct your customer to log into their Azure account and add their new payment instrument to their subscriptions in the Accounts Portal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public facing guidance on how to perform this action can be found at&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-how-to-change-credit-card" managed-link="" target="_blank">How to add or update a credit card on Azure</a>.&nbsp;For guidance on how to delete a credit card or payment method, see&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" data-linktype="relative-path" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/delete-azure-payment-method" managed-link="" target="_blank">Delete an Azure billing payment method</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It is not possible to update a payment instrument for subscriptions that are not in the customer&rsquo;s original directory (directory which user&rsquo;s commerce account is in) in the Ibiza Portal.</p>

<p>This is by design so the user cannot update payment instrument via the portal&nbsp;for subscriptions that have an edited directory (changed tenant), because of the portal&#39;s tenant info retrieval limits. There is no ETA for having this changed.</p>

<p><strong>Workaround</strong></p>

<p>Customers have t&#8203;he following options to work around this issue:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Go to the Accounts portal to update the payment instrument for that specific subscription.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Go to the original tenant and update the payment instrument in Cost Management + Billing blade.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Change the subscription back to the original tenant and update payment in Ibiza.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h4>Remove a Credit Card in CMAT</h4>

<ul>
	<li>The&nbsp;<em>Open </em>and <em>Ready </em>Balances&nbsp;of the PI to be removed&nbsp;<strong>must </strong>be zero.

	<ul>
		<li>If they are not, the <em>Remove Payment Instrument</em> option will remain grayed out.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The PI to be removed <strong>must&nbsp;</strong>be associated with a subscription that is in the <em>D</em><em>e-provisioned</em> state.</li>
</ul>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click the circled arrow to the right of the search result, highlighted in the below image.<br>
	<span asset="4568044" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4568044]</span></li>
	<li>Navigate to the&nbsp;<em>Payment Instruments&nbsp;</em>tab.</li>
	<li>Identify the PI to be removed and verify that the corresponding&nbsp;<em>Open Balance&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ready Balance&nbsp;</em>are both zero.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Click the down arrow to the right of the&nbsp;<em>Status</em>&nbsp;of the PI to be removed, which will bring up the tab depicted in the image below.<br>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Click the right-facing arrow at the bottom of the window.</li>
	<li>Confirm that the card number is correct, and paste the&nbsp;Service Request number into the&nbsp;<em>Service Request Number&nbsp;</em>field.</li>
