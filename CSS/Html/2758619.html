<span><span><span>Microsoft&rsquo;s primary goal is to provide an effective advertising experience for our advertisers, as well as a relevant, positive experience for consumers seeking products, services, and content on our search network and content network.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Our relevance and quality policy focuses on four core aspects of a campaign that affect user experience:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><a href="http://advertising.microsoft.com/small-business/learning-center/best-practices/relevance-quality-quidelines#RQ1"><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Keyword relevancy</span></span></span></span></span></strong></a><span><span> &ndash; How relevant are the keywords you chose? </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><a href="http://advertising.microsoft.com/small-business/learning-center/best-practices/relevance-quality-quidelines#RQ2"><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Ad copy (title, text, and display URL)</span></span></span></span></span></strong></a><span><span> - Do you have a highly relevant, accurate, well written ad? </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><a href="http://advertising.microsoft.com/small-business/learning-center/best-practices/relevance-quality-quidelines#RQ4"><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Landing page and site user experience</span></span></span></span></span></strong></a><span><span> - How does your site navigation and functionality affect users? </span></span></span></span></li>

</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Non-compliance with Relevance and Quality guidelines may result in ad rejection or manual penalty. Please ensure keyword, ad, and landing page choices meet the policies below.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="KeywordRelevancy" name="KeywordRelevancy"></a><br>
<span><strong><span><span><span>Enforcement Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span> Manual relevance review only occurs during LLR reviews, not in PMA.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Keywords should be relevant.<strong> </strong>This means your site should be a satisfactory destination for users, based on a primary user intent of the keyword(s) you select.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Your keywords should relate directly to either:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The specific range of products, services, or content on your landing page. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The general content, purpose, and theme of your site.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Please note: extremely popular or trending queries may be subject to a higher standard of relevancy and ads must fully align with the primary user intent of the keywords/queries to participate.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a id="AdCopy" name="AdCopy"></a><br>
<span><strong><span><span><span>Enforcement Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span> The following points are likely to be enforced reactively on escalation. If any of these issues exist, ORV Override should <strong>not</strong> be approved for this content.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Ads must:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Be clear, truthful and accurate</span></span></strong><span><span> - Clearly and accurately demonstrate in your ad how your keywords relate to the product or service you offer. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Be correctly constructed</span></span></strong><span><span> - Ads should be grammatically correct, not include misspellings, and be formatted correctly. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Manage expectations</span></span></strong> </span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Ads should not mislead. </span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Ads must be highly relevant to the product, services or information presented on your landing page, or the general content, purpose, and theme of your site. </span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>

If any of these issues exist, ORV Override should not be approved for this content.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Generally, we consider content to be valuable if it enables users to find the products, services or information they request easily, or assists users by informing or shortening their buying, or research process. Your landing page should provide clear, direct access to content that is related to your ads and keywords and should not obstruct, delay or confuse users. Landing page and site content should not function primarily to support the display of advertising or attract traffic.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Sites or landing pages may be considered low quality content if they:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Display a high density of advertising above the fold, and/or consist significantly of advertising or links. </span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span>Are built for search engines, featuring excessive off-topic keywords or pages that feature hard-to-read text. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Consistently feature sparse or limited content, particularly where the user would expect to find a range of offers, products or information on a similar site. </span></span></span></span></li>

<strong>Personal Data Collection Types</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span>Not all examples of personal data collection on landing pages are low quality. In fact, the collection of personal data and lead generation form the basis of many valid online business models.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Additional FAQS regarding this policy others can be found in the </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2989257" managed-link="" target="_blank">Policy: Microsoft Advertising Editorial FAQ</a><span><span> article.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q1" name="Q1"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Why does the PMA team no longer apply the Relevance and Quality Policy?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>The Relevance and Quality policy has some overlap to other Editorial policies that PMA does observe (e.g. pop-ups). The Relevance and Quality policy more closely supports efforts of review made by LLR and other quality review teams.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q2" name="Q2"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>How does the Appeals team apply this policy?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>The Appeals Team reviews and applies the policy as it&rsquo;s written. Appeals editors may remove a flag that is inappropriate and apply another rejection flag that is correct. They can make changes to the approval status made by LLR or PMA editors without receiving approval from the group that made the last update. If the disapproval was made by L3, please escalate to L3 again for confirmation before overturning.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q3" name="Q3"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Do the PMA or Appeals teams ever need to send QBR escalations?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>No. QBR penalty escalations can be sent by LLR and L3. The penalties are applied by the Ad Quality team through these as well as other escalation paths. PMA editors do not need to review for Relevance and Quality policy behaviors and Appeals editors do not need to send QBR escalations as this action has already been taken when the item was first rejected.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q4" name="Q4"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Can an advertiser use their Facebook, YouTube or other personalized page as their destination URL?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Yes, as long as they indicate it in their display URL (ex: </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.facebook.com/starbucks" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/starbucks</a><span><span>).</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q5" name="Q5"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What if an advertiser requires the user to log in to Facebook in order to view the landing page? This is common with alcohol campaigns to verify that the user is over 21.</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>While this is not ideal, we will allow this as long as the advertiser uses Facebook as their display URL (ex: </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.facebook.com/beertenderusa" target="_blank">www.facebook.com/beertenderusa</a><span><span>). Please note we will <strong><span>not</span></strong> grant ORV bypasses for campaigns that direct to the advertiser&rsquo;s Facebook or other personalized page rather than their own home page.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q6" name="Q6"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Are mobile landing pages evaluated differently than standard landing pages?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Yes, mobile ads are successful because of their limited content and usability, unlike regular landing pages. Thus, the following criteria <strong>are</strong> acceptable for a mobile landing page:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>There is no menu or user navigation system. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>No, or few, additional pages other than the home page. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Where the content is limited or mainly an image with no html.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q7" name="Q7"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>How can I tell if I landing page is a mobile landing page?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Unfortunately we do not have a reliable mobile emulator to help determine this. You can often identify mobile ads from the shorter length of associated ad copy, or by the destination URL, which usually starts with m. or includes /mobile. If ever in doubt, please escalate to L3.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q8" name="Q8"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Do we have any policy about the use of video on landing pages?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Videos are allowed and can be considered as part of the content in assessing the quality of a landing page. In general, a video on its own is not considered sufficient content for a landing page and would need to be accompanied by additional text and/or image content for a landing page to be considered high quality. Videos that start automatically or lack functionality such as pause, fast forward, etc., may be frustrating to users. We do not specifically restrict videos for these reasons, but they may be low quality indicators associated with either &quot;Sparse or Limited Content&quot; or &quot;Evasive, Sensational, or Confusing Content&quot; QBR classifications.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q9" name="Q9"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>When should I use the Spam Content flag?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Use the Spam flag for sites and URLs that don&#39;t comply with any one of these policy areas:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Business models that attempt to mislead site visitors, or that seem deceptive or fraudulent. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Pages that consist entirely of advertising, or whose main purpose is to direct site visitors to advertising. Includes link farms or parked domains. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>&quot;Bait and switch&quot; users &ndash; for example redirecting site visitors unexpectedly to unrelated domains. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Display a high density of advertising above the fold, and/or consist significantly of advertising or links. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Feature content that functions primarily to support ad monetization. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Are built for search engines, featuring excessive off-topic keywords or pages that feature hard-to-read text. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Consistently feature sparse or limited content, particularly where the user would expect to find a range of offers, products or information on a similar site. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Delay or obstruct the user&rsquo;s access to requested content, products or services by adding steps solely designed to monetize the user. </span></span></span></span></li>
