<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. What is optimization consultation?</h3>

<div align="center"><span> </span></div>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Optimization consultation is a complimentary service offered to existing customers in the scale segment who have the potential and opportunity to improve or increase their account performance. This service provides advertisers with customized optimization recommendations and assistance with implementing changes to improve their campaign health and performance. The service includes a one-session phone call with the customer, some potential tactical work conducted by you after the call, and an exit email with relevant resources to conclude the service engagement.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Program description</h4>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>The offer for optimization consultation is made via a marketing campaign with an invitation to contact our service team, referral from another team or through a personalized call from a service specialist.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>When a targeted customer accepts a marketing campaign&rsquo;s invitation to contact the services team, or when you proactively reach out to a pre-qualified customer who is interested in receiving the service, the person who engages with the customer delivers the service to that customer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Service advocates are also empowered to invite customers they previously treated with another service (for example, onboarding consultation) to receive the optimization consultation. This service is conducted by service advocates and available only in the markets listed in section 1.2 below.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Important notes:</span></span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If&nbsp;an existing customer calls for help optimizing their campaigns and reaches you, then&nbsp;assist the customer and code the ticket as a <strong>Microsoft Advertising Standard Support</strong> case. Be sure to select <strong>Yes</strong> in the <strong>Improving Campaigns</strong> section of the ticket for all tactics you pitched.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>If a&nbsp;customer contacts standard support in the following scenarios: Asks to speak with a specific service&nbsp;advocate, explicitly requests the optimization consultation service, specifically wants an AM or optimization specialist, specifically asks for an in depth account review, or the customer has an open SR where the Service Program field equals optimization consultation, then you should warm-transfer the case to the services team.</li>
	<li><span>If no one on the service team is available, confirm the customer&#39;s phone number, ask if they prefer to be contacted in the morning or afternoon, notate the service ticket with the customer&#39;s call-back preferences, then set expectations with the customer that a service&nbsp;advocate&nbsp;has been notified and will get back to them as soon as possible.</span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If&nbsp;you are proactively referring a customer to Optimization Consultation, make sure the customer has the Unified Customer Management&nbsp;(UCM)&nbsp;Opportunity &quot;RTOC-A&quot; under the opportunities tab.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a>1.3 Eligibility&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Many&nbsp;active Microsoft Advertising customers are eligible to receive optimization consultation.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>1.3.1 Eligibility requirements:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customer has a Microsoft Advertising account that is or was recently performing (performing means they have impressions or clicks in the last 30 days to ensure opportunities can be identified).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customer has a live business website compliant with Microsoft Advertising&rsquo;s security and editorial requirements.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customer&rsquo;s business model is compliant with Microsoft Advertising editorial guidelines.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>1.3.2 A customer is NOT eligible for receiving service if:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The account is flagged with a fraud status that will remain upheld.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The account&#39;s QBR penalty or business model prohibits it from serving in the auction.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customer has an account manager or is currently engaged with another <span><span><span><span><span>advocate&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span>(per UCM A<span><span><span><span><span>dvocate&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span>Dashboard).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customer&rsquo;s language or time zone is not supported by Microsoft Advertising services.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="ng-scope"><strong><span>Important notes:</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>When&nbsp;a customer contacts you on the services line and is not eligible for the service, treat it as a support case and code the ticket accordingly. Be sure to remind the customer of our support center contact info so that the next time they need help, they reach the right team. This is one circumstance where a service&nbsp;advocate will select <strong>Standard Support</strong> in the <strong>Program</strong> field of their ASD ticket.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>In&nbsp;cases where a customer who was previously treated with optimization consultation, contacts you with a support issue, and it has been over 30 days since the treatment and the account has new optimization opportunities, you may deliver the optimization consultation service again to that customer. Be sure to create a new ticket for this treatment. If you already know the customer&rsquo;s advertising goals, you may skip the interview portion of that workflow.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>If a&nbsp;customer has been previously treated with onboarding consultation within the last 30 days and is now on an optimization outbound list or calls inbound for optimization help, you can proceed with treating them with optimization consultation.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>In&nbsp;cases where a customer calls in and has been treated with optimization consultation in the last 30 days, you can still treat them and suggest opportunities. If you do not see any opportunities because the optimization has been too recent, tell the customer that you&rsquo;d like to wait one to two weeks to see how the recent changes impact their campaign. You can schedule a call or an appointment for one to two&nbsp;weeks out to treat them at that time.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>In&nbsp;cases where an outbound optimization lead is assigned to you in UCM that was on the UCM outbound lead list in the previous month, reject for <strong>duplicate lead</strong>.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><strong>2.1.6 My queue engagement</strong></p>

<p>Steps to engage customers in My Queue:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ensure the customer has been assigned to your My Queue.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the check box next to the customer name.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the <strong>Engage</strong> button located directly above the <strong>Customer Name</strong> column.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>A message box will appear. Confirm you want to engage the customer by selecting <strong>Engage</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The </span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span><span>customer&#39;s status will now show as &quot;engaged&quot; in the customer list of My Queue.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Steps to self-assign a customer in My Queue:</strong></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>To&nbsp;self-assign a customer to My Queue, complete the following steps:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Locate the customer in UCM.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the checkbox next to the customer name.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the <strong>Engage</strong>&nbsp;button.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the initiative <strong>Optimize Cons_GL_CSS_Ongoing.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Confirm the selection and the customer will appear in My Queue.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Prioritizing customers</strong></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>For optimization consultation, you should prioritize the list of customers by highest spend based on the last three months. </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Set the time period to last three&nbsp;months</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ensure you have the column &ldquo;Spend&rdquo; in your My Queue as a selected attribute.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Sort by current spent, largest to smallest.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span>Important notes before engaging the customer in My Queue</span></strong></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Read the below notes on UCM My Queue engagement</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customers should only be engaged once you&rsquo;ve established live contact with the customer &ndash; email doesn&rsquo;t count until the customer replies!</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Selecting <strong>Engage</strong>&nbsp;locks a customer in your My Queue until treatment is complete.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If self-assignment is not available, locate your manager to assign the account. When managers assign customers, customers will need to be manually engaged; see steps below to engage customer in My Queue.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If self-assignment is available and the customer is not already engaged with another <span><span><span><span><span>advocate&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span>(as determined from UCM), you may take ownership of that engagement by self-assigning the customer to your My Queue. Self-assigned customers will be automatically engaged.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>UCM engagement history &amp; alerts</strong></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>When looking at customers, it is important to understand their engagement history with Microsoft Advertising marketing and services and support. Understanding what tactics, emails and other engagements have happened can help you to formulate your pitch.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>When&nbsp;you are in the customer view in UCM, start with viewing the engagement history of the customer. Engagement history can show you any previous engagement from marketing or other services or support&nbsp;advocates. This may help you see tactics the customer has previously implemented or marketing campaigns that were sent to them. Simply go into the customer view and select the&nbsp;<strong>Engagement History</strong>&nbsp;tab. You will be able to see the date of the engagement, type of engagement, account the engagement was applied to, the user, a brief description, details, and other fields you can select by adding columns.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Clearing alerts</strong></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Clearing alerts is a benefit to the customer to ensure that their account health is good. To see alerts, go into UCM and select&nbsp;the alerts tile or the alerts tab.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Selecting the link icon in the tab will take you to the Microsoft Advertising UI to see the alerts.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Going into the alerts tab will give you an overview of the alerts that includes the account number, alert date, alert type, severity (critical or standard), and description.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can also add other attributes by going into <strong>Columns</strong>&nbsp;and selecting the desired indicators.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Logging sales of tactics &amp; pitching tactics in UCM</strong></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Logging the tactics that you pitched and sold are important to ensuring an accurate account of the customer experience and to track the work you&rsquo;ve done with the customer so that in the future, we have a history of what worked and did not work with that customer.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Go into the customer view.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the account XID you&rsquo;re working with under <strong>Accounts.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Go into the <strong>opportunities</strong>&nbsp;tab.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Look for any pre-determined opportunities. These will appear in UCM as shown&nbsp;below.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span asset="4025639" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4025639]</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>By selecting on the &hellip; icon, you can find out more about the tactic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>To pitch one of these opportunities, simply go to the pencil icon that says open. You can change the status from here and add notes. Be sure you &ldquo;save&rdquo; prior to closing out.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you want to pitch a tactic not listed in UCM as a predetermined tactic, you can simply create your own opportunity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do this by going into the <strong>Opportunity Tab</strong> and selecting <strong>Create Opportunity.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>You will then see a list of tactics by category (as shown below).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can then change the status of this tactic to pitched, sold, or rejected&nbsp;after you&rsquo;ve pitched this to the customer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Logging referral source in UCM:</strong></p>

<h3><a id="9" name="9"></a>9. Talking points about specific tactics</h3>

<div align="center"><span> </span></div>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;While reviewing your account I noticed some of your campaigns could benefit from using negative keywords. Negative keywords prevent your ads from showing up in search results that are unrelated to your business.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;Improving your campaign structure can help you reach your optimal click-through rate.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;It is recommended to have no more than three ads (including one dynamic) and no more than 100 keywords per ad group so you can better target those ads to only relevant searches.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;You&#39;ll want to ensure your keywords are grouped by similarity; meaning that a specific ad copy will speak to all the keywords within that ad group.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;You can decrease the budget in the &lt;&lt;campaign name&gt;&gt; campaign and use that money to increase the budget in the &lt;&lt;campaign name&gt;&gt; campaign to ensure you don&#39;t miss out on quality traffic from that campaign.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;On average, your campaigns are being paused due to your budget around &lt;&lt;enter time&gt;&gt;, which means your competitors ads are showing while yours are unable to get impressions.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;Last month, a portion of your keywords had zero impressions because of low bids. Boosting them will make your ads more competitive&mdash;and could even improve your ad position.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;To help improve your click-through rate, I recommend you update your ad copy to ensure it reflects a clear call-to-action to make it more compelling for your potential customers.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;You may be able to achieve a higher position on the Search results page by deleting ads with poor performance and introducing new, more relevant ads.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;I recommend that you test different calls to action to find the most compelling ad copy for your target audience. This may improve your CTR and make you more competitive in the auction.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;Improve your relevance by explicitly bidding on exact match terms. With exact match, you can more effectively target the consumers who search for your exact keywords.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;Reach more of your target audience by adding &lt;Phrase/Broad&gt; match to your exact match strategy.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>[If customer sells products and has a secure checkout on their website] &ldquo;<em>I recommend setting up a Bing Shopping campaign to showcase your products in an engaging ad format by including images, promotional text, pricing and your company name. Serving Product Ads on the Yahoo Bing Network lets you reach 31 million retail searchers that don&#39;t use Google in the US*&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></span></li>
