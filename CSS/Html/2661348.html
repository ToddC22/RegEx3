<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<ul>
	<li>An existing EA Administrator (Admin) must approve additions and removals of other EA Admins. This can be in the form of direct approval from the existing EA Admin, or in the form of an approval email attached to the case file.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Note</strong>: The EA Admin giving approval cannot be a <em>Read-Only</em> EA Admin.&nbsp;<br>
	<br>
	If you receive a case to update or to remove the <em>Read-Only</em> permission of an existing Enterprise Administrator,&nbsp;approval from another existing EA Administrator must be provided before proceeding with the change.<br>

<h4>Steps to Add or Remove an EA Admin</h4>

<h4><strong>Adding an EA Admin</strong></h4>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Navigate to the <span><span> <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://ea.azure.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">EA Portal</a>.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If managing more than one enrollment, select the desired enrollment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Navigate to <strong>Manage &gt; Enrollment</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Confirm that the <strong>Authentication Level</strong> is correctly set for the type of user being added. Change it accordingly if it is not correct.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>This setting will only affect the next user added. It will not impact any users that have already been added.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>If adding a Cross-Tenant Work or School account, change the <strong>Auth Level</strong> to Work or School Account Cross-Tenant.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click <strong>+Add Administrator</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Select the desired <em>Authentication Type</em>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Input the desired <em>Email Address</em> and Confirm Email Address. Also note the following:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Notification Contact is optional and may be left blank.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Notification Frequency defaults to Weekly.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Lifecycle Notification Suppression is not checked by default, allowing the system to send a notification when the enrollment is approaching its end of life.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Read Only</em> defaults to <em>No</em>. If the new EA Admin should only have read rights, change this option to <em>Yes</em>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Confirm that all information is correct and click <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>Removing an EA Admin</strong></h4>

<p>An EA Admin cannot be removed if they are the only EA Admin on the enrollment. To remove an Admin, do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Navigate to the <span><span> <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://ea.azure.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">EA Portal</a></span></span>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If managing more than one enrollment, select the desired enrollment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Navigate to <strong>Manage &gt; Enrollment</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Hover over the EA Admin to be removed and click on the blue <strong>X</strong> icon.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Confirm that the desired EA Admin is selected and click <strong>Yes</strong>.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>If a customer removes an account as an EA Admin but then sees that the account has been added back as an EA admin automatically by the system, check the EA Enrollment in Explore.ms to see if the affected account is a part of the participant list. If so, the customer should reach out to their software advisor to get the participant list updated and remove the requested account. Then, the system will not auto-sync and the unwanted EA Admin will not be re-added.</p>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<p>Customers who have the proper credentials can complete the actions listed in the <a id="CustomerExperienceAndProvisioning" name="CustomerExperienceAndProvisioning">Customer Experience and Provisioning </a>section above. However, in some cases customers may need <span>assistance </span>from support. In those instances, determine which of the following scenarios best applies to the customer&rsquo;s request and follow the guidance accordingly.</p>

<h4>Request from an Existing EA Admin</h4>

<p>In some cases where the EA enrollment status is not Active, the EA Admin will not have the <strong>+Add Administrator</strong> option and will need to contact support for assistance. In these instances, the requestor will need to provide approval to add an EA Admin on their behalf. Be sure to verify the customer before adding.</p>

<h4>Request not from an Existing EA Admin</h4>

<p>Support can add EA Admins on the customer&rsquo;s behalf once the customer has provided the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Approval from an existing EA Admin on the enrollment</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Confirmation of the desired Authentication Type of the user to be added as an EA Admin.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the desired customer has been added as an EA Admin, be sure to inform the requestor of this update to their portal.</p>

<h4>Requests from Direct, Indirect Organizations, and Partners</h4>

<p><strong>Direct</strong></p>

<p>Direct customers may contact support for updating the Admins for their organization. In these instances, inform the customer that they will need to contact their Software Advisor to update the NTC Admin (using either the manual CICR method or the electronic CICR method <a bookmark-id="CICRMethods" href="#CICRMethods" managed-link="">detailed below</a>).</p>

<p>The customer can also reach out to their Bill-to-Contact to provide the approval. In return, support can help add the EA Admin once approval has been provided.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:<strong> </strong>Refer to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4463565" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 4463565</a> for information on how to view the Software Advisors, NTC Admin, and other contacts on the enrollment.</p>

<p><strong>Indirect</strong></p>

<p>Indirect EA customers may contact support for updating the Admins of their organization. In these instances, inform the customer that they must contact their Partner to update the enrollment&rsquo;s NTC Admin (using either the manual or electronic CICR method <a bookmark-id="CICR Methods" href="#CICRMethods" managed-link="" target="">detailed below</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Partner</strong></p>

<p>Inform the customer that as a Partner/Software Advisor, they can update the NTC Admin using either the manual CICR method or the electronic CICR method (see details below).</p>

<p><strong><a id="CICR Methods" name="CICR Methods"></a>CICR Methods</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Manual CICR method:</strong> A Partner can submit a Customer Information Change Request (CICR) form to update the NTC Admin. The form should be submitted to the Regional Operations Center (ROC) through a <a bookmark-id="InitiatingtheWarmTransferProcess" data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4463565#InitiatingtheWarmTransferProcess" managed-link="" target="_blank">Call Logging Tool (CLT) ticket in Explore.ms</a>. In return this will update the default EA Admin.</li>
</ul>

<p><br>
<strong>Note:</strong> If the EA Portal is not automatically updated after the NTC Admin has been updated, SEs can manually add the new default EA Admin to the EA Portal since the information has been updated at the agreement level.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Electronic CICR method:</strong> A Partner can update the NTC Admin via eAgreements. This will update the default EA Admin. If the EA Portal is not automatically updated after the NTC Admin has been updated, SEs can manually add the new default EA Admin to the EA Portal since the information has been updated at the agreement level, or SEs can request that Electronic Communications Information Technology (ECIT) re-push the agreement details for the enrollment by following the below steps:</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Compose an email message addressed to <a href="mailto:OrderL3@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">OrderL3@microsoft.com</a> and <a href="mailto:orderhlp@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">orderhlp@microsoft.com</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In the subject line, enter: <strong>Order re-push [Enrollment Number]</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In the email body, provide the following information:</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p>Enrollment Number</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Request that ECIT re-push the enrollment because details at the agreement level have not been updated in the EA Portal.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>If there is a request to re-add an existing EA Admin with another authentication type for an indirect enrollment that is in <em>Pending</em> status, and the requestor is <strong>not</strong> one of the contacts from the participants list, the change can be done without a CICR. Be sure to verify that the requestor is from the Partner company/organization.</p>

<h4>Request from an Internal Team</h4>

<p>Internal teams at Microsoft may contact support on a customer&rsquo;s behalf and request to add or remove EA admins. In these instances, provide the internal team with the following action options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Contact the Partner/Software Advisor to update the NTC Admin.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Select someone from the agreement participants list to be included in the email thread in order to provide approval.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>In urgent cases where the above two options are not possible, the SE can add the requested user as an EA Admin if<strong> </strong>the internal team has provided assurance that they have completed the necessary checks and the internal team agrees to take full responsibility for authorizing this action.</p>

<h4>Request to Add a Partner Administrator</h4>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: A Partner Admin may be set up as Read Only.</p>

<p>Email approval from an existing Partner Administrator is required to add a new Partner Administrator. Once this approval has been received, perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Verify that the email address that the customer requests to add is a valid email address and authentication type combination.</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>
		<p>If the email address is valid, proceed to step 2.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>If the email address is not valid:</p>

		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>
			<p>If the email address is for a Microsoft Account, notify the customer that they will need to create a new Microsoft account.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>If the email address is for a Work or School Account, notify the customer that, if they have Office 365/Azure Active Directory (ADD), they need to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/add-users-azure-active-directory" managed-link="" target="_blank">add the user to the Azure Active Directory</a>. Otherwise, they may want to consider using a Microsoft Account instead.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Check if the request is from an existing Partner Admin using step 1-5 under <a bookmark-id="AddingaPartnerAdmin(MSAdminUser)" href="onenote:#Add%20Partner%20Admin&amp;section-id={AA8A9381-84EF-4883-B88A-252576157B4C}&amp;page-id={81548A28-B677-45DE-86E7-3116BF7254CB}&amp;object-id={C1D74EC4-2419-447A-912B-9CF724055D9B}&amp;5F&amp;base-path=https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AEPS/SiteAssets/AEPS%20Notebook/Activation.one" managed-link="" target="">Adding a Partner Admin (MS Admin User</a>.

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the request is not from an existing Partner Admin, notify the customer that any of the existing Partner Administrators on the enrollment can add a new Partner Administrator using the steps under <a bookmark-id="AddingaPartnerAdmin(ExistingPartnerAdmin)" href="#AddingaPartnerAdmin(ExistingPartnerAdmin)" managed-link="">Adding a Partner Admin (Existing Partner Admin)</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Alternatively, the customer may provide email approval from an existing Partner Admin on the enrollment. In this case, confirm the email address and Authentication Type of the user that the customer would like to add. Once this approval is obtained, add the Partner Admin using the steps under <a bookmark-id="AddingaPartnerAdmin(MSAdminUser)" href="onenote:#Add%20Partner%20Admin&amp;section-id={AA8A9381-84EF-4883-B88A-252576157B4C}&amp;page-id={81548A28-B677-45DE-86E7-3116BF7254CB}&amp;object-id={C1D74EC4-2419-447A-912B-9CF724055D9B}&amp;5F&amp;base-path=https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AEPS/SiteAssets/AEPS%20Notebook/Activation.one" managed-link="" target="">Adding a Partner Admin (MS Admin User)</a>.

<p><strong>Frequently Asked Questions about Departments</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><em>Does deleting a D</em><em>epartment delete the associated accounts?</em>&nbsp;</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>No. When a Department is deleted, the associated accounts are returned to the Unassigned category.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Can a deleted Department be restored?</em></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>When a Department is deleted, it is marked as Inactive. Inactive Departments cannot be returned to Active status.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>I have deleted a department and I want to create another department with the same name. Why do I encounter an error when I try to do so?</em></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Department names can only be used once. To work around this, modify the department name slightly by adding a space, symbol, number, or dash so that the system will recognize it as a different name and allow creation of the new department.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Is it possible to completely delete a department so that it does not show up at all?</em></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>For record-keeping purposes, it is not possible to completely remove a Department. Please ensure that the <em>Active</em> checkbox at the top right corner of the Department list view is checked if you would like to hide the inactive departments from view.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>What is the default view for Department</em><em>s</em><em>?</em></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>The <em>Active</em> checkbox in the Department tab is checked by default. It is unchecked automatically if there are only Inactive Departments on the list.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>What can a Department Admin see if they are </em><em>also an Account Owner?</em></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>They will see all that would normally be seen by a Department Admin as well as an Account Owner.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Can a Department Admin simultaneously </em><em>be an Account Owner on the same enrollment?</em></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Yes.</p>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p><em>Can a Department Admin simultaneously </em><em>be an EA Admin on the same enrollment?</em></p>

<h4><span>Add or Change a Billing Administrator</span></h4>

<p>Billing Administrators have limited edit access. They can edit PO numbers and download usage reports.</p>

<p>Billing Admins cannot be added or changed in the EA Portal. They are added to enrollments automatically based on the user that is set up as the Bill-To contact on Explore.ms. To change the Billing Admin, the Bill-To contact must be changed by issuing a request to the Regional Operations Center (<span>ROC</span>).</p>

<p>If the Billing Admin is an existing EA Admin, an information icon will be displayed beside the EA Admin status. An EA Admin who is also a Billing Admin cannot be deleted from the EA Portal.</p>

<p>The table below depicts the features available and not available in the EA Portal to a Billing Admin. If the Billing Admin is also an EA Admin, they will also have EA Admin rights.</p>
