&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This article provides workflows on how customers can cancel their subscriptions, how engineers can help customers cancel their subscriptions, and the various cancellation policies and processes associated with subscription cancellation.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<h4><strong><a id="Suppliers and Vendors" name="Suppliers and Vendors"></a>Suppliers and Vendors</strong></h4>

<p>Supplier and internal vendor ASMS Support Engineers must obtain Technical Advisor (TA) or Partner Technical Advisor (PTA) approval before suspending or canceling any subscriptions in the Commerce Management Agent Tool (CMAT).</p>

<p>Use the TA/PTA engagement template in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2929022#TA%2FPTA%20Engagement">TSG 2929022</a> to send these requests to your TA or PTA.</p>

<p>Some suppliers include:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Mindtree</strong></li>
	<li><strong>TekExperts</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Wipro</strong></li>
	<li><strong>110/Launch Consulting</strong></li>
	<li><strong>NTT</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Vendors in Korea and Taiwan</strong><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><a id="Pay-As-You-Go Offers" name="Pay-As-You-Go Offers"></a>Pay-As-You-Go Offers</strong></h4>

<p>Customers can cancel at any time without any penalty fees. They will still owe the balance for any unbilled or unpaid monthly consumption.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><a id="Commitment Offers" name="Commitment Offers"></a>Commitment Offers</strong></h4>

<p>The Microsoft Online Subscriber Agreement (MOSA) allows Microsoft to charge customers for the remainder of their commitment term. However, this is often waived at the discretion of the Microsoft Azure Billing Team, although the customer still owes for any unbilled or unpaid overages that they might have incurred.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><a id="Azure Internal Registration System (AIRS) Subscriptions" name="Azure Internal Registration System (AIRS) Subscriptions"></a>Azure Internal Registration System (AIRS)</strong><strong> Subscriptions </strong></h4>

<p>It can take up to two weeks for internal subscriptions to be reviewed once they have gone into a <em>Disable&nbsp;Review</em> status. In these instances, you can communicate the following to your customer:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Subscriptions go into a <em>Disable Review</em> status when they are labeled as production subscriptions. Due to this status, they must be carefully reviewed before they can be cancelled. Please note that it can take up to two weeks for the subscriptions to be reviewed and cancelled.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: For subscriptions in a Disable Review process longer than three weeks, or instances where an EA subscription is in Disable Review after <span>cancellation and deprovisioning, </span>reach out to the Azure Internal Offer team through an <span asset="4497459" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4497459]</span> <span asset="4498193" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4498193]</span> to review and manually disable the subscription.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After three weeks, send the <span asset="4498193" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4498193]</span> to AIRS Team with a <span asset="4498193" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4498193]</span> Title/Subject line &quot;Disable Review feature to be removed&quot; to avoid any push-backs, as the AIRS Team does not cancel or delete AIRS subscriptions. Do not mention subscription deletion or cancellation on subject lines to AIRS Team.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> An approval from a principal or partner level Dev Manager is required to remove subscriptions from <em>DisableReview</em> when its Services Administrator is not available to approve it. If the subscription is not department-owned, then an email from their direct manager is required. Attach the approval email and note this in the task.</p>

<p><strong>Important: This operation is only to be performed by the AIRS team. ASMS is not authorized to perform the DisableReview Operation.&nbsp;</strong><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><a id="Authorization" name="Authorization"></a>Authorization</strong></p>

<p>The Account Owner, Service Admin, Co-admin, and RBAC Owner (Subscription level) can make a request to cancel or request an ownership transfer.</p>

<p>AIRS cancellation requests can also come from Managers, Requestors, and Finance.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Legacy MINT Subs Cancellation" name="Legacy MINT Subs Cancellation"></a>Legacy MINT Subscription Cancellation</strong></p>

<p>The AIRS team may cancel the subscription only with the&nbsp;approval of the team that owns the subscription.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="Account Management" name="Account Management"></a>Account Management</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Cancellation of a subscription will cause the permanent deletion of a customer&rsquo;s data to occur 90 days after the cancellation date, after which time Microsoft will be unable to recover the data.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>It is important to make sure that the customer understands the cancellation cycle and what impacts it may have on their data.</li>
		<li><strong>Note:</strong> For more information, please see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646880">TSG 2646880</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The customer&#39;s profile and billing information will remain in the system after cancellation.</li>
	<li>If your customer doesn&rsquo;t want to cancel their subscription but wants to stop charges for a deployment, they can manually delete their deployed Azure packages using the Azure Management Portal.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>In this case, all application data will be removed, and the customer will not receive further charges. However, the customer&rsquo;s profile and billing information will remain in the system, and they will be billed for usage at the next billing cycle.</li>
		<li><strong>Exception:</strong> Virtual machines (VMs) can be stopped/deallocated to pause billing without outright deletion.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>If a customer cancels a paid Azure Support plan, they are billed for the remainder of the subscription term.

<p>Always engage ASE first when you are asked to engage ACE (unless there is an emergency).</p>

<p>Do not use the ASE template as a way to open ICM tickets to any other team. ASE is not the same as ICM.</p>

<div>If the current account owner and current service administrator are not able to process <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-how-to-cancel-azure-subscription" managed-link="" target="_blank">self-cancellation via these steps</a>, the standard procedure for Azure Internal Consumption subscription (MS-AZR-0015p) cancellation requests is to have <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/azureinternal/SitePages/Azure%20Internal%20Support.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure Internal Support</a> assign a new service administrator on the subscription(s) needing cancellation.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>More information can be found at <a href="aka.ms/azrinternal" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure Internal Portal</a> under the &quot;Update a Subscription&rsquo;s Service Administrator&quot; section, which states:</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Is the current Service Admin on the subscription still at Microsoft?&nbsp;</strong></div>

<div>If so, please reach out to the current Service Admin and ask them to update the Service Admin by following the below steps:</div>

<ol>
	<li>Sign in to <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">https://portal.azure.com</a>.</li>
	<li>Click the subscription blade.</li>
	<li>Click on the specific subscription.</li>
	<li>Click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Service Admin</strong>.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<div><strong>Is this a Bulk Service Admin update (updating the SA on 10+ subs to a new Service Admin)?</strong></div>

<div>Please confirm that you have approval from the account owner, requester, or manager listed on the registration to update the Service Admin on the sub. Additionally, please provide a document with the list of Subscriptions GUIDs, Current Service Admin, and the New Service Admin. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/getsupport?wf=0&amp;tenant=classiccommercial&amp;oaspworkflow=start_1.0.0.0&amp;locale=en-us&amp;supportregion=en-us&amp;pesid=16267&amp;ccsid=636392710931361485&amp;forceorigin=esmc" managed-link="" target="_blank">Submit a ticket</a> to request the bulk service admin update.</div>

<div>Per the <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/azureinternal/SitePages/FAQ.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure Internal Portal FAQ</a>, accessible to all internal employees, we detail the cancellation process in two ways (under the &quot;Subscriptions&quot; section):</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>How do I cancel a Subscription?</strong></div>

<ol>
	<li>Login to <a href="https://portal.azure.com/" target="_blank">https://portal.azure.com</a></li>
	<li>In the center of the screen you will see &quot;Subscriptions&quot;</li>
	<li>Select the subscription you wish to cancel and a new screen will appear to the right</li>
	<li>Up near the top of the screen you&#39;ll see &quot;Cancel Sub&quot;</li>
	<li>You will be prompted to delete all resources prior to cancelling the subscription, so make sure you deprovision all services running on the subscription.</li>
	<li>You&#39;ll be prompted to enter the subscription name - on the screen you&#39;ll see &quot;Subscription Status&quot; and then a name such as &quot;Microsoft Azure Internal Consumption&quot;</li>
	<li>Complete the next fields and then at the bottom select <strong>Cancel Sub</strong><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Someone has left the company, how do I cancel their subscriptions or move them to another account, and then cancel the account?</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Verify that the Manager reflected on the AIRS registration is associated with the subscription.</li>
	<li>If the Manager is listed on the AIRS registration, escalate a task to your technical advisor (TA), partner technical advisor (PTA), or team lead (TL) to have the manager, or whoever the customer designates, to be added as a co-admin.<br>
	<br>
	If the Manager is not reflected on the AIRS registration, they do not have the authority to request a subscription cancellation.</li>
	<li>Once the Manager is added as a co-admin to the subscription, they can review the resources and cancel the subscription.</li>
</ol>

<p>Azure Internal Support is only able to cancel subscriptions in situations where technical difficulties or other business critical reasoning prevents self-cancellation (as we do not cancel subscriptions on behalf of account owners and service administrators due to liability issues). In these situations, we will need approval from their Partner Director or Principal PM or equivalent to cancel the subscription, as the account owner approval will not suffice for internal subscriptions. These are very rare escalation scenarios.&nbsp;If Account Admin, Co-Admin or Service Admin, is unable to cancel the Subscription, reach out to ASE team to understand why they are unable to cancel as it is likely a bug (This step is required). In order to unblock the customer, seek appropriate approval and help with cancellation.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>If a subscription needs to be cancelled and nobody in Microsoft has access to the sub, engage your TA to add the requestor as a co-admin to the subscription. Then the co-admin can delete the services and cancel the subscription from the portal normally.&nbsp;</p>

<div>
<p><strong>Note 2:</strong> If the Azure Internal consumption Subscription account owner left the company, and we need to identify the Subscription guid (e.g., to reassign the SA role to somebody else), we can search by account owner&#39;s email in BIOS at <a href="aka.ms/airs" managed-link="">aka.ms/airs</a>. Given that the AIRS Subscription guids will be listed in the Subscription column of the results, even if the Account owner&#39;s PUID does not exist anymore in Jarvis and in CMAT the account is not searchable any longer.</p>

<p>Example: the FTE user&nbsp;left MS, and his AIRS Subscription remained active, causing charges to his manager. In BIOS you can locate the Subscription GUID even if the account is orphaned in CMAT and the PUID does not exist in Jarvis queries.<br>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<h4><a id="CancellationofCSPOffers" name="CancellationofCSPOffers"></a>Cancellation of CSP Offers</h4>

<p>Customers do not have access to cancel their CSP Subscriptions. They need to contact their Partners for assistance in cancellation.</p>

<p>Follow these steps to deprovision a CSP Subscription:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The Admin Agent must provide an approval email which acknowledges:
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Cancellation will result in Complete Data Loss</li>
		<li>Microsoft cannot recover any data lost due to this process</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Provide the approval email to PayOps and they will perform the deprovision process.</li>
</ol>

<div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The subscription may take up to 7 days to register as &ldquo;deleted&rdquo; in CMAT and will then no longer appear in the Partner portal.</p>
</div>

<h4><a id="Support Engineer Subscription Cancellation" name="Support Engineer Subscription Cancellation"></a>Support Engineer Subscription Cancellation (<strong>FTE Only</strong>)</h4>

<p>Only use this process when a customer is unable to cancel on their own.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Verify that the customer making the request is the Account Admin before proceeding with a cancellation request.</li>
</ol>

<ul class="indent-1">
	<li>Do not accept any cancellation confirmation other than a cancellation confirmation coming directly from the Account Admin&#39;s Microsoft Subscriber Account (MSA) or OrgID.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
	<li>If the Account Admin is unable to send an email confirming their approval of Microsoft cancelling the subscription on their behalf, follow the approval guidelines for a <strong>Forced SOT</strong> from the Subscription Ownership Transfer TSG (<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3040383" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TSG 3040383</a>).</li>
	<li>Always attempt to retain the customer per the <strong>Retention Offer Scenarios</strong> table below. If the customer still wants to cancel and is unable or unwilling to do so themselves via the portal, continue to Step 4.<br>

<h4><a id="Customer Requests to Delete Entire Azure Account" name="Customer Requests to Delete Entire Azure Account"></a>Customer Requests to Delete Entire Azure Account</h4>

<p>A customer may ask that we delete their entire Azure &ldquo;account&rdquo;. Verify exactly what the customer wants deleted as customers may use the terms <em>subscription</em>, <em>account</em>, and <em>profile</em> interchangeably. Customers may not know the correct term for what they are requesting, so before making any changes, always verify exactly what they wish to have deleted.</p>

<p>If you confirm the customer does want to have their entire Azure account deleted, advise the customer we are unable to delete their account profile. However, we can remove their credit card information so that no more payments will be processed once their subscriptions are deprovisioned. To do this, go to CMAT and remove their credit card information. Then verify the resource is deprovisioned to avoid any further charges.</p>

<p>If a customer wants to remove a PI from their account and requests to delete their subscription, confirm there are no pending charges.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> You must first receive AA approval before completing this request. Inform the AA that data is not recoverable once a subscription has been deleted.</p>

<p><strong>SE Directions</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Verify that the subscriptions status in CMAT is set to PI removed.</li>
	<li>Notify the customer that their subscription has been cancelled and&nbsp;their PI has been removed.</li>
	<li>Close your case.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the customer requests to keep their case open until the lifecycle of the subscription is complete, respect their request.</p>

<p>Modern support plans act like SaaS-based Marketplace purchases (because they have a&nbsp;<em>future billing/term-based&nbsp;</em>behavior.)</p>

<p>There are two ways to cancel support plans:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Disable the auto-renew option for the subscription.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>This will keep the subscription active until the next billing cycle, at which point it will be cancelled.</li>

<h4><a id="EAandAIRSSubscriptionDeletionRequests" name="EAandAIRSSubscriptionDeletionRequests"></a>EA and AIRS Subscription Deletion Requests</h4>

<p>These types of accounts are exceptions to the above processes and have separate lifecycle and cancellation management processes.</p>

<p class="ng-scope">EA and AIRS subscriptions go to <strong>DisableReview</strong> when cancelled. These are manually reviewed by the AIRS team.</p>

<ol class="ng-scope" style="list-style-type:decimal">
	<li>For EA and AIRS cancellation requests, obtain necessary approvals:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><strong>EA</strong> &ndash; Account administrator, EA administrator</li>
		<li><strong>AIRS</strong> &ndash; Account administrator, AIRS requestor, AIRS manager, AIRS approver</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Attach the approvals to the case.</li>
</ol>

<ol class="ng-scope" start="3" style="list-style-type:decimal">
	<li>In Service Desk, create a collaboration task for your <strong>Suppliers &gt; Reach out to PTA, FTEs &gt; </strong>and continue to step 4.</li>
	<li>In CMAT, use the <strong>Suspend &gt;Customer Immediate Cancellation</strong> action to suspend the subscription.</li>
	<li>Once cancelled, If the Entitlement State of the sub moves to &quot;DisableReview&quot;, proceed to step 6. If the Entitlement state of the sub does not move to &quot;DisableReview&quot;, the process is complete and the sub should get De-provisioned automatically after 7 days.</li>

</ol>

<p class="ng-scope">The subscription is deleted (de-provisioned) 7 days after the day of cancellation (or after the AIRS team performs the operation).</p>

<h4><a id="DisableReviewDetails" name="DisableReviewDetails"></a>Disable Review Details</h4>

<p>There are a few other offer types that go to <strong>DisableReview</strong> upon cancellation. Few examples are: Sponsorship, Azure Pass, some PAYG subscriptions etc. (The actual list varies based on various factors). Follow the steps under (3) for such scenarios.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><strong>Disable Review</strong> <strong>Cases</strong>: Follow the <a bookmark-id="Non-SupportPlanDeletionRequests" href="#x__For_non-support_plan" managed-link="" target="">Non-Support Plan Deletion Requests</a> process for any case that moves to <strong>Disable Review</strong> state for deletion requests.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Free Trial (44P) subscriptions</strong>: Deleted 2 days after the immediate cancellation process has been performed.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong>Executive and High-Priority</strong>: Follow these directions for escalations which require immediate deletion of subscriptions:</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>Create a Priority 1 task with the ASE/CXP team to engage the ACE team.</span></li>
		<li><span>Include these approvals:</span>

			<li><span>CELA - ACE team: <strong>Justin Widlund</strong> (CELA)</span></li>
			<li><span>Approval from <strong>Vivek Dalvi</strong> (Partner GM)<br>

			<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;ACE&nbsp;should only be contacted through the ASE escalation path. ASE will engage&nbsp;ACE&nbsp;and get back to you with an appropriate response.

</ul>

<p>Deleting a subscription deletes all the underlying resources and data. It&rsquo;s a terminal state and a subscription, once deleted, can&rsquo;t be recovered. Hence, to avoid service disruption due to accidental deletion, we keep the subscription disabled for a few days after we receive your request to cancel the subscription. In the disabled state, you&rsquo;ve limited access to your services and aren&#39;t charged. You can re-activate your subscription at any point of time before it gets permanently deleted.</p>

<h4><a id="Re-EnableImmediatelyCancelledSubscriptions" name="Re-EnableImmediatelyCancelledSubscriptions"></a>Re-Enable Immediately Cancelled Subscriptions</h4>

<p>Subscriptions can only be re-enabled after an immediate cancellation if your customer makes their request before the 7-day suspension has ended.</p>

<p>Follow the below instructions to re-enable immediately cancelled subscriptions:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span> <strong>Suppliers</strong>: Engage your PTA to perform these steps.</span></li>
	<li><span> Suspend the subscription (again) for subscriptions with a <strong>Customer Immediate Cancellation</strong> status:</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>Select the status code <strong>Customer cancellation</strong>.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span> The option to re-enable the subscription should now be available.</span></li>
</ol>
