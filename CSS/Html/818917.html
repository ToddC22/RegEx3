<p><span><span><span><span>This article describes what to do if a customer wants to cancel an Xbox Live Gold membership.<br>
<br>
<strong>Who </strong>should follow this process? (Affected agent types)</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Accounts &amp; Billing</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Xbox</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong>What </strong>is this process about?</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>This process provides agent scripting and recommended resources for agents to help customers understand the value of the Xbox Live, so that agents can make the right recommendation for customers who want to cancel their memberships.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong>When </strong>should this process be followed?</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Whenever a customer wants to cancel their Xbox Live Gold membership by either turning off auto-renewal, removing the payment instrument associated to the Xbox Live subscription, or cancelling the subscription immediately.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Applies-to markets:</strong> All markets.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="kb-moreinformation-section section">
<h3>Policy</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>If the payment instrument owner calls to cancel the membership, you must still first try to verify the customer. Always use the process in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/2885545">KB 2885545 Policy: How to handle a customer who is the payment instrument owner but not the account owner</a>.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Process</h3>

<p>When a customer calls to cancel, we want them to know that we value their business. We also like to learn why someone wants to cancel their membership and try to keep them as an Xbox Live customer by explaining the benefits and value of the Xbox Live service. This will be unique for every customer based on how the customer is currently using the service and why they want to leave.</p>

<h4>Steps for the People&rsquo;s Republic of China</h4>

<p>If you are presented with the saves and retention workflow, select the following options:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>I don&#39;t use Xbox Live anymore</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>I am too busy to use the service</strong></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Steps for the rest of world</h4>

<p>Follow the steps below to help understand why the customer wants to leave Xbox Live, how to use MST to gain insight on how a customer is using Xbox Live, and identify resources based on the customer&rsquo;s reason for cancelling.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Ask the customer what they like about the Xbox Live service.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Navigate to the Recent Activity section of MST. This is where you will find information specific to the apps and content the customer uses that you can leverage to connect with the customer and ask probing questions.<br>

	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Ask the customer why they want to cancel their membership. Based on the customer&rsquo;s response, use the resources in the Cancellation reason categories (below) to help the customer see the value of the Xbox Live service and to identify possible recommendations that will help keep the customer as an Xbox Live Gold member.</p>
