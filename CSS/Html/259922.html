For example, if your server has a 10.0.0.<strong class='sbody-strong'>x</strong> Internet Protocol (IP) address, the primary DNS server for 10.in-addr.arpa (which is the reverse-lookup zone for the 10.<strong class='sbody-strong'>x</strong> address range) currently is blackhole.isi.edu.

For example, if your computers are using a 10.0.0.<strong class='sbody-strong'>x</strong> IP address, create a reverse-lookup zone of 10.in-addr.arpa on the local DNS server on which the Windows 2000-based computers are attempting to register.<br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Option 2</h3><span><span class='text-base'>Important</span> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: <div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-1' href='/en-us/help/322756'>322756 </a> How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</div></span>Disable Windows 2000 from registering the PTR record, using the following steps:<br><br><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Start Registry Editor (Regedt32.exe).</li><li>Locate the following registry key:<div class='indent'>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters<br></div></li><li>On the <span class='text-base'>Edit</span> menu, click <span class='text-base'>Add Value</span>, and then add the following registry value:<div class='indent'>Value Name: DisableReverseAddressRegistrations<br>Data Type:  REG_DWORD<br>Value:      1<br></div></li><li>Quit Registry Editor.</li></ol>This option disables DNS dynamic update registration of PTR records by this DNS client. PTR records associate an IP address with a computer name. This entry is designed for enterprises in which the primary DNS server that is authoritative for the reverse-lookup zone cannot or is configured not to perform dynamic updates. It reduces unnecessary network traffic and eliminates event log errors that record unsuccessful attempts to register PTR records.<br></div><div class="kb-moreinformation-section section">You can use the <span class="text-base">nslookup</span> command from a command prompt to try and verify the information.
