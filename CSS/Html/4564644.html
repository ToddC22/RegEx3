<h3><span><span><span><span><span>What is this article about?</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>This article explains why users are being asked to add a phone number to their Microsoft Account when using Microsoft Teams and how to troubleshoot for issues.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><span><span><span><span><span>Summary</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Like most consumer communication apps, Teams for your personal life relies on your phone number to find and connect to your friends and family.  Adding a phone number to your Microsoft account allows you to find others already on Teams. It also adds an extra layer of security to your Microsoft account.</span></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>When signing in to Teams with your personal Microsoft account, you need to have a phone number as a sign-in alias on that account. There can be only one phone number as a sign-in alias as when signing in with the phone number, we need to know which account that is. </span></span> </span></span></p>

<p class="paragraph"><span><span>If you get asked to add a phone number to your Microsoft account when signing in to Teams, you need to: </span> </span></p>

<ol>
	<li class="paragraph"><span><span><span>Make sure the correct country is selected in the dropdown menu. </span> </span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li class="paragraph"><span><span><span>Type your full phone number without the country code and tap <strong>Next</strong>. </span> </span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li class="paragraph"><span><span><span>You will receive a text message with a verification code, type it in and tap <strong>Next</strong>. </span> </span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="paragraph"><span><span>If the phone number is not already an alias on another Microsoft Account, it will be added to your Microsoft account as an alias and you can use it to sign in to your account going forward.</span> </span></p>

<h3 class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span>Troubleshooting</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p class="paragraph"><span><span><span>If you get the following error message:</span></span></span></p>

<p>

<p><span><span><em><span>This phone number has already been taken. Sign in with that number or use a different one.</span></em></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The phone number is already an alias on another Microsoft account. You have a couple of options how to resolve this situation: </span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span> <span>If this is your correct number, you can just try to sign in with the phone number. This will sign you in to the Microsoft account which has the phone number and you can use that account for Teams for your personal life. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span><span><span> <span>You can move the phone number over from the Microsoft account which has the number. You can do that by going to </span><a href="https://account.live.com/names/Manage" target="_blank"><span><span>https://account.live.com/names/Manage</span></span></a><span> and signing in to the other Microsoft account and then removing the phone number as an alias from that account. This frees the number to be used as an alias to the account you were initially trying to sign in to. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span>You might also be taken through a flow to automatically move the phone number over to the Microsoft account you are signing in to. In this case you just need to follow the instructions on the screen. </span></span></span></p>
