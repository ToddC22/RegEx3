<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The Microsoft Advertising Affiliate Program is currently available in multiple international markets and will continue to expand over time. The markets include: US, Canada, UK, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, Brazil, Mexico, India, Australia, and New Zealand.<br>
<br>
The goal of the program is to help drive new SMB search advertiser acquisitions through an affiliate marketing channel. Affiliates are also sometimes referred to as publishers.&nbsp;Affiliates benefit from this relationship because they can earn revenue from the qualified customer leads or referrals that they drive to Microsoft Advertising, as well as extend a value-add offer to their customers.<br>
<br>
Microsoft Advertising has partnered with a third-party affiliate marketing network by the name of Commission Junction. By working with Commission Junction, affiliates can apply to join our program, access our marketing assets to begin promoting Microsoft Advertising, track and view performance reports, and receive commission payments.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>After a publisher establishes a relationship with Commission Junction, and becomes a current CJ Network Member, all further support is provided by the CJ Support Center. The CJ Support Center can be reached at 1-800-761-1072 (Monday-Friday, 6 AM - 5 PM, PST) or </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><a href="http://www.cj.com/support-center" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span><span>http://www.cj.com/support-center</span></span></span></span></span></span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Syndicated search ads help expand query volume, increasing impressions and clicks for advertisers. Besides Bing.com, AOL.com, and Yahoo.com, Microsoft Advertising offers two other channels to deliver an advertiser&rsquo;s ads to third-party websites: The search syndication network and the content syndication network. These channels include Bing owned and operated (O&amp;O) sites, Yahoo O&amp;O sites, AOL O&amp;O sites, and syndicated partners. Ads are considered syndicated when Microsoft Advertising distributes ads to partner websites and shares advertising revenue with those partners.<br>
<br>
Participating websites are required to meet Microsoft Advertising standards. Participating partner websites are third-party, non-Microsoft-owned webpages that may be blogs, content portals, or search results alongside general web content. An ad&#39;s performance on a syndicated search partner will not affect its ranking on Microsoft Advertising.<br>
<br>
Syndicated search ads and syndicated organic search services are separate, and our syndication partners may use one or both services, depending on the specific terms of the partnership.<br>
<br>
Search ads and Content ads may be syndicated to the same partner sites. Advertisers can reach the partner audiences through both mediums.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Microsoft has been syndicating Content ads to third-party web publisher sites since 2007, and syndicating search advertising through Bing. The Yahoo O&amp;O sites and Yahoo partner sites joined the network later, same with the AOL O&amp;O Sites and AOL partner sites. Generally, we will try to notify internal teams of significant changes in distribution volume.<br>
<br>
The majority of Microsoft Advertising search ads are served on search engine results pages through Bing.com, AOL.com, and Yahoo.com and through our Microsoft owned and operated portal, MSN.com.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>All Search Networks (Bing, AOL, and Yahoo Search and syndicated search partners)<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;This is the default and includes all sites in the network.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="4.6" name="4.6"></a>4.6&nbsp;Selecting distribution and bids</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Enhanced search network distribution controls for the United States, United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, France, and Canada allow advertisers to display search ads on Microsoft Advertising, on partner sites exclusively or on the entire combined search network (which is the default setting). Microsoft Advertising sites cannot be individually selected, but advertisers can set different bids on the owned and operated sites compared with the syndicated partner sites. In Western Europe and LATAM, this option is not yet available.<br>
<br>
For Singapore, enhanced search network distribution controls allow advertisers to set search ad network distribution at the ad-group level. They can also choose whether to display only on Bing syndicated partners, only on Bing websites or on the entire Bing search network (which is the default setting).<br>
<br>
In all markets, advertisers can use the enhanced website exclusion feature for search ads to designate&mdash;at the campaign and ad-group levels&mdash;up to 2,000 individual sites to exclude from displaying search ads (previously advertisers were only able to exclude 500 sites). This change should result in improved campaign performance by enabling advertisers to weed out search-syndicated sites that are not producing high returns. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Use the <a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/ext50833/-1/en" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Website URL (Publisher) Performance report</span></span></span></a></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span> to determine which publishers&#39; sites aren&#39;t delivering high-quality traffic. The use of conversion tracking can help identify which sites to exclude.<br>
<br>
Advertisers can also improve the return on advertising spend by preventing ads from showing on specific search-syndicated IP addresses that aren&rsquo;t resulting in the desired returns. They can optimize campaigns by using IP Exclusions to block ads from showing on specific IP addresses or IP ranges that may distribute Microsoft Advertising results. This functionality, along with website exclusions, allows advertisers to enjoy the volume of search syndication while still being able to refine traffic.<br>
<br>
To determine which IP addresses to block, run the <a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/ext50833/-1/en" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Website URL (Publisher) Performance report </span></span></span></a></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>to identify low-performing IP addresses</span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="5" name="5"></a>5. Monitoring traffic from Syndicated ads</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Syndicated search clicks are reported along with Microsoft Advertising clicks. To see Content ads syndication performance down to the ad-group level, pull a <a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/ext50833/-1/en" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Website URL (Publisher) Performance report </span></span></span></a></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>in Microsoft Advertising.<br>
<br>
<strong>Smart pricing</strong><br>
<br>
We recognize that not all clicks are created equally and to help advertisers with campaign ROI management, we sometimes automatically make adjustments to click charges based on our assessment of the performance of traffic coming from sources within our network. Ultimately, this means advertisers may receive discounts on click charges for lower-performing traffic.<br>
<br>
<strong>Syndicated partners</strong><br>
<br>
Search syndication deals do not impact Microsoft Advertising search market share. Such deals, which are common in the industry, are typically excluded from market share volume tracking. The Nielsen and comScore search query metrics are often not inclusive of syndicated traffic. Occasionally, search syndication deals include the publisher granting Microsoft Advertising their query share. In such cases the increased searches are added to the industry reported numbers.<br>
<br>
<strong>Facebook search ad syndication: </strong>In the US, Microsoft Advertising syndicates pay for search advertisements through Facebook. This partnership extends exposure and increases query volume for Microsoft Advertising advertisers, and it also offers access to the highly influential and growing Facebook audience. Facebook search ad syndication placements will only display for users interested in web results and associated, relevant ads. Search queries in Facebook&#39;s search box result in a list of people, pages, web results and more&mdash;searchable separately by tabs in the left navigation column. When a user clicks Web Results in the left navigation column, they will see Bing web results and Microsoft Advertising paid search ads.<br>
<br>
This implementation will generate additional commercial queries by up to 35 million Facebook users. Search advertisers will gain exclusive access to the highly influential Facebook audience within the interactive and viral Facebook environment&mdash;extending audience reach and expanding query volume.<br>
<br>
<strong>Sympatico.ca search ad syndication: </strong>After five&nbsp;successful years of managing the most visited online portal in Canada (sympatico.MSN.ca), in connection with Bell Sympatico, Microsoft launched MSN.ca, a portal which it owns and operates exclusively. In tandem with Microsoft&rsquo;s announcement, Bell Sympatico launched its new consumer portal, sympatico.ca. Through Microsoft Advertising, advertisers&rsquo; ads serve on bing.ca, but Bing also now powers search engine results for both MSN.ca and sympatico.ca. Advertisers&rsquo; campaigns can benefit from the volume and audience reach that both independent portals generate.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>MSN.ca (CA only): It&rsquo;s the premiere web destination for relevant, fun, and insightful content, news features, lifestyle editorials, and entertainment news for Canadians online. It&rsquo;s an online content leader for consumers and an innovative partner for advertisers, publishers, and marketers interested in engaging Canadians online.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Troubleshooting</span></span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><br>
<br>
If an advertiser expresses extreme concern about search syndication, work with your manager to determine the root cause of the advertiser&rsquo;s complaint and which optimization tactics would improve the advertiser&#39;s satisfaction with ad performance. This may mean excluding individual domains that do not convert well and possibly advertising on Bing, AOL, and Yahoo owned and operated search only (excluding all syndicated search)</span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. Smart pricing FAQ</span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Do these adjustments to click charges change how much advertisers need to bid?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Our assessment of the quality of our traffic sources does not need to affect how advertisers place their bids on keywords. Adjustments based on those assessments are automatically applied to click charges at the time of the click. However, based on an analysis of how much an advertiser is saving from our adjustments to the click charges, the advertiser may wish to take advantage of those savings by experimenting with bidding higher on some keywords to gain a higher position in search results and more traffic.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How does the assessment of the quality of traffic sources and adjustment of click charges affect an advertiser&#39;s account?<br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>There is no action required on the advertiser&#39;s part; adjustments are automatically applied to click charges where they are warranted.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How is the quality of a partner/publisher assessed?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> A partner&rsquo;s quality is based upon our assessment of its ability to deliver more interested, high-value, potential customers. We take multiple factors into account, including conversion rate, when assessing a partner&rsquo;s quality.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Are&nbsp;the amount of the discounts revealed to the advertiser? Can it be broken out by partner?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, this information is not currently available, but we are working on enabling this feature in the upcoming releases of Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How will advertisers know if they are getting any discounted traffic?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> While we will not provide specific information on the discounts advertisers receive, as they manage their search marketing campaigns they may find that their average cost per click has gone down since we began adjusting click charges based on the performance of traffic sources (provided, of course, that the advertiser does not change bids or ad creative).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Do the adjustments affect Content Ads traffic too?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Yes, they apply to both Content Ads and paid search ads.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How much will an advertiser&#39;s cost per click be?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> An advertiser may be charged less for certain clicks than the advertiser otherwise would pay, depending on the overall quality of the traffic source on which the ad appears.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why would an advertiser still seem to be getting traffic that doesn&rsquo;t convert from certain sites?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The volume of traffic that an advertiser receives is not impacted by any performance-based pricing adjustments we may make; the adjustments only impact the amount an advertiser is charged for clicks from certain sites, based on the quality of the traffic they provide. As advertisers manage their search marketing campaigns, they may find that the average cost per click has gone down since we implemented this enhancement to pricing (provided, of course, that the advertiser does not change bids or ad creative).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: What if the advertiser does not want traffic from a particular source at all, regardless of the price per click?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>We currently offer the ability for advertisers to opt out of particular sources of traffic using our Enhanced Website Exclusion feature, which lets them exclude up to 2,000 individual sites on which they do not wish to advertise.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="7" name="7"></a>7. Ads powered by Media.net FAQ</span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: What has been announced regarding Yahoo and Media.net?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Yahoo and Media.net have announced a technology partnership where Yahoo has selected Media.net to help provide the classification algorithms that enable Yahoo to monetize various Yahoo properties by showing relevant ads from the Yahoo Microsoft Advertising Network. Media.net has been providing this service to 11 Yahoo properties including Yahoo Finance, Shopping, and Sports for several months. Testing and experimentation started more than 18 months ago. With the announcement, Yahoo will expand the scope to include other properties and other qualified partners who can benefit from this technology implementation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Who is Media.net?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Media.net is a premium contextual advertising company that uses superior analysis and classification algorithms to dynamically identify and deliver the most relevant and engaging ads on a webpage.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: What business is Media.net in with Yahoo?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Media.net is a technology provider that is powering Display to Search (D2S) ad units that drive quality traffic from Yahoo properties and affiliate partners to advertisers on the Microsoft Advertising. This offering is available in North America initially.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Where is Media.net based?</strong><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Media.net has offices worldwide, including Mumbai, India and Austin, Texas.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: What are the top three&nbsp;benefits of this partnership?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>First: comScore and user traffic to Yahoo.com domains and properties. Second: A competitive replacement of Google AdSense ad units on off-network publishers that will help Yahoo grow its share of commercial query volume. Third: Incremental high revenue from quality traffic.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Is the ad inventory being served from Microsoft Advertising?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Yes, the ad inventory will come from advertisers who use the Microsoft Advertising platform to advertise on Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How does this affect advertisers that are currently running campaigns on Microsoft Advertising?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Advertisers will not be affected. This partnership represents an opportunity for additional premium publishers to join Microsoft Advertising, where advertiser ads will run. There is no action needed for advertiser accounts at this time.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Does the Microsoft standard sales team sell this inventory?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Yes. This inventory will be available to advertisers as part of the affiliate publisher network and all the normal advertiser controls will apply so that campaigns can be customized to specific advertiser needs. The Yahoo Premium sales team is also selling this inventory.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How is ad quality of this new traffic reviewed?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>The Display to Search (D2S) implementations that Media.net enables have been running on 11 Yahoo properties and on some affiliate partners for several months. Testing and experimentation started more than 18 months ago. The traffic has been subject to all the normal traffic quality scoring and discounts and has performed well. Additionally, the initial implementations and the performance data have been reviewed by Yahoo&rsquo;s MIT team, and the performance has been fully compliant with Network Quality Standards.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Is this a competitive product to Microsoft&rsquo;s Content Match?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>No. Microsoft&rsquo;s Content Match is a product for advertisers. This is a technology offering for Yahoo properties and for select Yahoo partners. The offering complements Microsoft&rsquo;s Content Match because the Display to Search implementation has the capability to call Microsoft Content Match as part of the ad units that it generates, increasing the supply of Microsoft Content Match inventory available on Yahoo properties and affiliated partners.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Does Microsoft share in the revenue?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Yes. Microsoft will share in the revenue generated from this technology solution according to the revenue share agreement between Yahoo and Microsoft.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How is D2S different than Search Retargeting?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Search Retargeting is when searches by users are tracked and used to present relevant display ads to the user soon after they conduct those searches. &ldquo;Display to Search&rdquo; or D2S is where keywords are placed inside a graphical display ad. When a user clicks on one of these keywords, the keyword is sent to our sponsored search marketplace and drives a search results page with sponsored search ads. When Media.net runs D2S on Yahoo Vertical Properties, Yahoo benefits by selling the display inventory *and* sharing revenue on the resulting sponsored search ad click.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="8" name="8"></a>8. <span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Advertisers concerned about invalid clicks on Search Ads Syndication <span>FAQ</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<div>
<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: I had a spend spike last month and discovered I was showing up on syndicated search. No one told me I was opted into syndication, and they&rsquo;ve provided no conversions. Can I be credited back for this traffic?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>When we transferred Yahoo users to Microsoft Advertising, we sent information about the benefits of advertising on Microsoft Advertising, which includes automatic access to syndicated traffic from our publishers, which is intended to help you reach more potential customers. We strongly encourage you to optimize your campaigns for our entire network. Although we can&rsquo;t guarantee conversions or give credit for clicks that are considered valid, we can help you understand how to optimize your campaigns for better performance on our publishers&rsquo; websites.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why can&rsquo;t I opt out of the syndicated search partner network? (For markets other than US, UK, CA, FR, and IE)</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Although you don&rsquo;t have the option to opt out of syndicated search partner traffic in your market, you do have control over which websites or domains your ads display on, and you can choose to work only with websites or domains you prefer. You can run the publisher performance report in Microsoft Advertising to find out which websites or domains aren&rsquo;t driving clicks that convert well for your business. You can also determine which sites aren&rsquo;t converting using Campaign Analytics in Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
</div>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: I had a big spike over the last week in spend and was told it was from Trending Now (a Yahoo owned and operated site). You told me this was valid traffic, but I got no conversions from it. Can I get my money back for this poor-quality experience?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>The Trending Now section on Yahoo is similar to Bing&rsquo;s Popular Now section, and allows users to see your ad without having to search for a related term. The user experience is they will click on a Trending Now term that interests them. The user is then shown search results for that term and associated ads. If the user then clicks on your ad, they will be taken to your landing page and that second click is counted. If you&rsquo;re bidding on trendy keywords that are relevant to current events, news or pop culture, you may see an increase in impressions from Trending Now. Although we can&rsquo;t guarantee conversions or give credit for clicks that are considered valid, we can help you understand how to optimize your campaigns for better performance on our publishers&rsquo; websites.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: I&rsquo;m getting low-quality traffic. Why should I trust your publishers?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>We invest a lot of effort in monitoring the quality of our network. Although we can&rsquo;t guarantee conversions or give credit for clicks that are considered valid, we can help you understand how to optimize your campaigns for better performance on our syndicated search partner websites. You can run the publisher performance report in Microsoft Advertising to find out which websites or domains aren&rsquo;t driving clicks that convert well for your business. You can also determine which sites aren&rsquo;t converting using Campaign Analytics in Microsoft Advertising. When we do find instances of invalid activity, we work with our engineering teams to prevent the same traffic from repeatedly impacting our advertisers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: In the last month, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of money on clicks from syndicated sites that you say are valid, but they haven&rsquo;t returned a single conversion. Can I get my money back for these poor-quality websites?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>We invest a lot of effort in monitoring the quality of our network. Although we can&rsquo;t guarantee conversions or give credit for clicks that are considered valid, we can help you understand how to optimize your campaigns for better performance on our syndicated search partner websites. You can run the publisher performance report in Microsoft Advertising to find out which websites or domains aren&rsquo;t driving clicks that convert well for your business, and prevent your ads from displaying on them. In some markets like the US, our pricing system evaluates partner traffic at the time the click is charged and will apply a discount to that charge if the traffic is less likely to convert than sites like Bing or Yahoo Search. In addition, we use other measurements of the traffic that publishers deliver to understand how to discount. Discounts are automatically applied to advertisers where applicable.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: If you know these publishers are bad and you&rsquo;re refunding my money, why don&rsquo;t you just take the publishers down?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>The identification of invalid traffic does not necessarily mean that all clicks from a single website or domain are invalid. Individual advertisers perform differently on different syndicated search partner sites. We recommend that you monitor your traffic regularly to see which sites result in conversions&nbsp;and exclude those that don&rsquo;t. When we do find instances of invalid activity, we work with our engineering teams to prevent the same traffic from repeatedly impacting our advertisers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why doesn&rsquo;t Microsoft exclude websites that are providing invalid clicks?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>The identification of invalid traffic does not necessarily mean that all clicks from a single website or domain are invalid. Individual advertisers perform differently on different syndicated sites. We recommend that you monitor your traffic regularly to see which sites result in conversions and exclude those that don&rsquo;t. Our system automatically works to detect invalid clicks through a complex system of filters and eliminates charges on any clicks we believe should not be billed to advertisers. This system identifies click and impression patterns using multiple layers of data points to help inform how the system identifies invalid clicks and impressions. We have internal teams working to monitor and update systems on a regular basis to continue ongoing protection. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why should I exclude websites where I found the invalid clicks? Why don&rsquo;t you automatically exclude them and not let them do more harm?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>It&rsquo;s not necessarily the website as a whole that is the cause of invalid clicks, but possibly another entity or person that has accessed the website. Our system automatically works to detect invalid clicks through a complex system of filters and eliminates charges on any clicks we believe should not be billed to advertisers. However, you also have control over which websites you work with and can choose to work only with websites you prefer. You can run the publisher performance report in Microsoft Advertising to find out which websites or domains aren&rsquo;t driving clicks that convert well for your business. You can also determine which sites aren&rsquo;t converting by using Campaign Analytics in Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: I&rsquo;m getting traffic from a publisher that doesn&rsquo;t have a search bar. How can it drive clicks?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>A publisher site isn&rsquo;t required to have a search box to participate in the network. For example, through clicking keyword links on partner websites or partners displaying a directory of topics (which act as a searched keyword), a user can be displayed sponsored links.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How can the referrer for my clicks be Google?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Google.com will sometimes show up in publisher performance reports due to Microsoft Advertising partnerships. When a user has one of these applications installed and is also navigating to Google, the referrer the browser supplies is google.com (or whatever website the user is currently on) for any click activity. These are valid user clicks.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why am I getting such a high click-through rate from sites that appear to be all ads and have no content (these are sometimes called parked domains) and why do you allow these types of websites on your network?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>Partners&rsquo; sites are different from one another and if the most prominent elements on the page are the ads, this can result in a high click-through rate. To be part of Microsoft Advertising, publishers must comply with strict guidelines, the same way advertisers have to comply with our editorial policies. We invest a lot of effort in monitoring our network and act when policies are no longer complied with.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How is Microsoft protecting me as an advertiser against parked domain clicks?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Microsoft Advertising consists of many types of publishers including domain publishers.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
We invest a lot of effort in monitoring the quality of our network and we review partners regularly to ensure their adhesion to Microsoft Advertising policies. Although we can&rsquo;t guarantee conversions or give credit for clicks that are considered valid, we can help you understand how to optimize your campaigns for better performance on our publishers&rsquo; websites.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Am I eligible to receive a credit for the invalid leads I received?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-IE"><span><span>Unfortunately, we can&rsquo;t guarantee that information entered into forms on your website will always be valid, so we can&rsquo;t issue credits for the corresponding invalid clicks. </span></span></span><span><span><span>We can investigate further, and we may be able to issue credit depending on the outcome of the investigation.</span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

Can I get some information from you?</span></span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><br>
Required information: Full data set from the client, not sample data.</span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why doesn&rsquo;t Microsoft block these clicks before I get billed for them?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Unfortunately, we&rsquo;re only able to tie the problem to invalid clicks after you provide us with information about the invalid leads. Therefore, we must request details, including the IP address of the clicks sending invalid lead information.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-IE"><span><span><span>We can&rsquo;t guarantee that information entered in forms will always be valid, so we&rsquo;re not able to issue credit for the corresponding clicks. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>If we&rsquo;re able to investigate further, we may be able to issue a credit depending on the outcome of the investigation</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: What can I do to limit future exposure to invalid leads?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>When we receive multiple reports of invalid leads tied to the same publisher, we investigate and work with our partners to fix the situation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>was </span></span></span></strong></span></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> there a traffic spike post migration?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>When the ad-serving transition completes, the combination of Yahoo Search, Bing, and partner traffic, as well as a new competitive landscape, may cause costs-per-click (CPCs) and volumes to fluctuate. Advertisers are engaging with a new platform, an improved algorithm, and consequently historical benchmarks may not be reflective of the new environment. Advertisers could therefore see different CPCs and search volumes for the same keyword from the one they used to experience prior to migration. We encourage our advertisers to focus on their ROI and monitor their bids as a regular best practice. On our end, we are paying strong attention at the evolution of the search volumes, ensuring that the additional inventory unlocked by the new platform and the impact of our partner network fulfil the needs of our advertisers. Typically, from previous experience, we expect that a given market would reach a stabilized state within the month following the end of migration and start to provide clear actionable patterns for advertisers to refine their strategy.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why is O&amp;O insignificant in comparison to syndication?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>When you purchase ads through Microsoft Advertising, you&rsquo;re reaching an active, engaged audience on Microsoft Advertising. This network aggregates the audience that uses Bing and Yahoo Search and their partner web publishers. Such partners are selected locally by Yahoo or Microsoft to help advertisers reach their desired audience, while ensuring an appropriate advertising environment for the consumers and advertising ROI. If partners are an area of growth for our audience, both Yahoo and Microsoft are committed in growing our owned and operated audience. For instance, Bing is at the heart of the Windows 8 and Windows Phone experience, and it is adopted by a growing number of partners such as Nokia, RIM and Kindle as their default search engine.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: You tell me I have control and can block domains I am not happy with, but I must&nbsp;pay and get the clicks first. Why?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong></span></span></span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising is constantly expanding, and we want to offer advertisers the flexibility to adapt their distribution to their business objectives. If a publisher partner stops delivering the conversions that you were originally experiencing, you can decide to exclude it from your distribution list. By upgrading to Microsoft Advertising, you have also unlocked a greater level of control. Its Site Exclusion feature enables you to suppress up to 2,000 domains from your distribution.</span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How we can allay SMB advertisers&#39; worries and build trust around this period?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>When Microsoft and Yahoo joined forces, we wanted to offer advertisers a real alternative in search. The Yahoo Microsoft Advertising Network, </span></span></span><span><span><span>we delivered 121 million unique searchers in Europe1. </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Microsoft Advertising, as a platform, is simpler and more transparent to use: Our platform is aligned to industry standards and has a Google Import feature, which enables you to easily import existing campaigns, to keep them synchronized with your Google AdWords account. Microsoft Advertising also offers transparency into the auction process, allowing you to take critical actions to improve your campaigns. This transparency is at the core of our product development, which is why we value customer feedback that we are integrating into the development cycles of our product and the selection of our partners.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
