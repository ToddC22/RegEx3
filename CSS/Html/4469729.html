<h4><a class="bookmark" id="1.1"></a></h4>

<p><span><span><span>The home console enables other users on the console to play downloaded games if they were not the primary purchaser or to play online games without having a GOLD subscription. There is a limit of 5 times that a console may switch as the home console per year, which is clearly displayed on the&nbsp;account page and customers can see how many switches remain. </span></span></span></p>

<p>In the past, customers would call Xbox support to get additional switches added to their account by advocates. They could do this up to three&nbsp;times per year. The result was increased contacts and abuse of game sharing outside the home console procedure. For this reason, the Assist team has developed a way for customers to earn one additional home console switch without contacting Microsoft<span><span><span>. </span></span></span></p>

<h3 class="sbody-h4"><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Procedure</h3>

<p><span><span><span>Effective November 14<sup>th</sup>, 2018, advocates&nbsp;will no longer switch the home console counter in MST for customers who have exceeded their limit and a</span></span></span><span><span><span>ccess will be terminated, this is also&nbsp;when we enable an on-console experience for customers.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The new experience will allow only one additional switch per year, which customers can earn&nbsp;by doing the following:</span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Completing&nbsp;a simple quest</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Watching&nbsp;a video </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Doing&nbsp;a survey</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span>Customers still have five&nbsp;home console switches per year in advance of this one earned&nbsp;switch.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1 Call handling</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the&nbsp;customer contacts Xbox support <span><span><span>with the issue of not being able to switch their console, e</span></span></span></span></span></span>xplain that Xbox now offers just one switch per year and that it can only be earned directly on console by completing a quest (self-serve).&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>This change means zero support for this scenario, see below for more details:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The home console feature is <strong>never to be used for troubleshooting</strong>. If a customer has a log in or game issue <strong>do not</strong> advise them to change home consoles to see if it works elsewhere. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Do Not</span></strong><span> advise a customer to create an additional account if they forget their log in, then use home console to &ldquo;share with themselves&rdquo;.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Help customers understand the <strong>licenses are not on the console</strong>, they are with an account so everywhere they log in they can play with others to share</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Do not</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> conduct a home console switch.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>You cannot see customer switch history or details; this is now entirely self-serve.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Do not</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> stay on the call or chat to &ldquo;walk a customer through&rdquo; finding the extra switch option on console, this is now a self-serve scenario. You should only provide the information on the resource and then end the contact. Only customers who<em> request and require </em>assistance should be guided through the switch process.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Do not</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> offer to assist with the quest unless the customer requests it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>No home console switch capability is enabled for any advocate of any tier, at any site.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<a id="2.2" name="2.2"></a>2.2 Code as follows in ASD</span></span></span></h4>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong>Root Cause</strong>: Home Console Switch Limit Reached</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong>Solution Delivered</strong>: No More Switches Allowed</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>This will provide us the data that for this contact, the customer was directed to get one additional switch on console if they have not used this benefit yet. Unless the call or chat is lost, no other Solution Delivered should be used (do not use Educated Customer, contact dropped, or other options).</span></span></span></p>
