<p><strong><span><span><span>NOTE</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: <strong>Partners can add up to 5 of their organization&#39;s top locations per region</strong>. These locations appear when customers search for partners by proximity, indicating locations that are official company locations and can be validated. Partners should pick locations that are central to the markets they serve, and best represent their company&#39;s ability to fulfill.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>VERY IMPORTANT: Today we have a lot of requests from partners saying that they want to change their company name in their business profile, NOW we have a clear message that states the fact that it cannot be modified unless partners want to modify their legal company name, more info on the &ldquo;Learn more&rdquo; link.</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customers often choose to send the same RFI to multiple companies at the same time. To increase your chance of success, we recommend accepting or declining new leads within 24 hours or less.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Make sure that the partner knows who the Referral Admin is in their organization, and if this will be the same person to receive the referrals (the email address entered in the business profile). Advise them to check spam filters for missed referral notifications. This person can create distribution list to allow other people from his organization to also receive the notification email and respond as soon as possible to the referral. <em>We recommend that an alias or distribution list is used that will allow multiple people to receive/access the email notifications to ensure that the referral can be responded to within the timeframe.</em> </span></span></span></span></p>

<h4>Responding to a lead</h4>

<p><em><span><span><span><span>Important disclaimer: Please note that Microsoft DOES NOT verify the identity of referrals or whether the interests of those referrals are legitimate. Microsoft has only verified that partners may contact the individual or company being referred in accordance with the details provided. This referral should not be construed as a Microsoft endorsement of the company or individual being referred. It is partner&rsquo;s responsibility to take any actions necessary and appropriate to safeguard their company from fraud in connection with these referrals.</span></span></span></span></em></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Each lead moves through a life cycle of its own and this section will help partners understand the different stages and the actions that they can take in each stage.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Received stage:</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span> In this stage partners receive a new lead either directly from the customer or from a Microsoft employee. Partners should review the details, and feel free to contact the customer if they want to learn more about their business needs. They can take two actions in this stage. Either accept or decline the referral:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Accept</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Partners should enter a name for the deal, the estimated deal value, and the estimated purchase timeframe. They should also provide info in the <strong>Notes</strong> field to explain more about what the customer is looking for. They can optionally enter their CRM ID (for their reference only), the marketing campaign ID which resulted in the respective lead and add additional contacts from their company. When they&#39;re finished, they should select <strong>Next</strong>. We&#39;ll move the referral to the next stage, which means that the partner plans to actively engage with the customer to address their need. We&#39;ll also use this information to help partners find similar deals in the future.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Decline</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Partners need to select the reason they&rsquo;re declining the deal and add any notes they would like to include, then select <strong>Close deal</strong>. We&#39;ll archive it as <strong>Declined</strong> and notify the customer to choose a different partner.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If partners don&#39;t respond within the allotted time (currently 14 days), we&#39;ll archive it as <strong>Expired</strong> and notify the customer to choose a different partner.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
