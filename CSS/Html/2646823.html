<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This article describes how to troubleshoot and verify credit or refund requests.</p>

<p>Note that this document does not get into the technical details of <em>how</em> to generate a refund in our tools, but rather the policy details surrounding validating refund requests from our customers. To generate a customer refund in CMAT, refer to the <em>Applying Credits and Refunds in CMAT</em> TSG (<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3084129">TSG 3084129</a>).</p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Applies To</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: All Non-Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers who are requesting credits or refunds. If you have an EA customer who needs a credit or a refund, refer to TSG </span></span></span><span><span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658533/"><span>2658533</span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span> and </span></span></span><span><span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4094770"><span>4094770</span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The following is a (non-exhaustive) list of reasons why customers might request a refund:</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Credits or refunds are always applied at the </span></span></span><em><span><span><span>Subscription level</span></span></span></em><span><span><span> as opposed to the Account level.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Microsoft can only credit or refund the charges we invoiced them for, and only in the currency they were charged in.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><strong>Credit Cards:</strong> If we are providing a refund to a credit card, we can only refund the card that the customer initially charged.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>If the original card is unavailable (due to being expired or canceled), engage the&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2927087" managed-link="" target="_blank">Global Financial Services (GFS)</a>&nbsp;to have a check sent to your customer.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the customer incurred other charges by other institutions (such as their bank or due to currency conversion), Microsoft is unable to refund these charges. Even PayOps can&#39;t refund a greater amount than was charged.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span>If the currency used on the account is not in United States dollars (USD), use the <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/tools/currencyconverter">MSN Currency Converter</a> to determine what empowerment level is needed for your credit.</span></li>
	<li><span>Only GFS should collect banking information from customers. If your customer needs to modify or submit their banking information, engage the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2927087" managed-link="" target="_blank">GFS</a> team to handle that interaction with your customer. They will ensure that it is done securely.</span></li>
	<li><span><strong><span><span><span>Write-Off:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Please follow steps in the &#39;Write Off (WO) process for credit card customers only&#39; support scenario in&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2651536" managed-link="" target="">TSG&nbsp;2651536</a>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li>
	<p>Do not suggest temporary case closure to the customer. You may receive cases where the request is not able to be fulfilled or resolved within a reasonable timeframe. The resolution may not be available until weeks or months later (ex: quota increase backlog, credit request). In these situations, you should keep the case open until the case is resolved.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Note</strong>: Closing a case temporarily or prematurely can result in a survey being sent to the customer despite the issue being unresolved. It can also skew the data used to track case volume.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Credits for the following support scenarios can only be generated once the billing cycle that the incident occurred in closed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the billing cycle is still open: </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><span><span><span><span>Confirm the situation that the customer is contacting you about is supported by ASMS. If it is not, get the customer in contact with the right team as soon as possible.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the situation is supported by ASMS, appraise your customer of the need to wait for the billing cycle to be closed.</span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><strong><span><span><span>Leave the ticket open. </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>You will be working from the same ticket after the billing cycle has closed.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Use the <em>SR Wait State</em> of <strong>s</strong></span></span></span><strong><span><span><span>ituation mitigated, pending</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Set a task or a reminder to contact and follow up with your customer after the billing cycle has closed.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span><a id="1. Technical Support Usage Charges" name="1. Technical Support Usage Charges"></a>1</span><span>. Technical Support Usage Charges</span></h4>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Exception:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If the customer reports working with EdgeCast (our content delivery network (CDN) provider) to troubleshoot an issue, we will need to credit them back for usage charges incurred during that event. Escalate to your Partner Technical Advisor or Technical Advisor (PTA or TA). They will need to work with EdgeCast to validate the test usage. After they are done, the TA or PTA will update the task, and you can then continue to work the case and give credits or refunds as needed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Directions: </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p>If you receive a case from a customer who requests a refund for their paid technical support subscription, determine which of the following fits the situation:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the customer&rsquo;s subscription is within its first 30 days <strong>and</strong> the customer has not used the subscription to access technical support, you can grant them a refund without further approval.</li>
	<li>If the customer&rsquo;s subscription is more than 30 days old, or the customer has used the support subscription, normal policies for credit and refund requests apply.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>If the customer&#39;s request is related to Azure Rapid Respond (ARR), refer to <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3084129" managed-link="">TSG 3084129</a>&nbsp;for guidance.</p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Summary: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Your</span></span></span><span><span><span> customer was unable to access their services due to one of several types of incidents.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>When processing a complete refund for a virtual machine (VM), the calculated amounts should include the VM Licensing charges.</p>

<h4><span><a id="5. Internal Customer Credit Request" name="5. Internal Customer Credit Request"></a>5. Internal Customer Credit Request</span></h4>

<p><strong>Summary: </strong><span>A: An internal customer received charges on their personal credit card for usage incurred for Microsoft business. (This does not apply to personal use.)</span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Directions: </span></span></span></strong><span>If you have an internal customer that wants a credit or a refund, on their personal card. This is not supported and against the internal use policy. They need to work with their manager/finance department to file the expenses through msexpense. </span></span></p>

<p>B:&nbsp;An internal customer requesting for a credit/refund on their internal subscription.</p>

<p><strong>Directions: </strong>All internal refunds/credits have to be initially worked upon by ASMS. The ASMS Engineer will gather all the required data validating the customer&#39;s claim for the credit. Once all data/information is collected, the refund has to be calculated by downloading the usage report from the AIRS tool.</p>

<p>Once the calculations have been done, engage the Azure Internal offer team through a collaboration task to approve and apply the credit/refund.</p>
