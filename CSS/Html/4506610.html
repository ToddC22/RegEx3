<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span>Account verification is the method used to validate that you are speaking to the true owner of the Microsoft account. This occurs by sending a code to a customer&rsquo;s phone or email address.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span>After locating the customer&rsquo;s Microsoft account in your support tool, <span>use the <strong><span>send code</span></strong> button </span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span><span>to send a code to the customer.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span>If sending to an email, the customer must be able to receive emails at the email address listed in your support tool.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span>If sending to a phone, the customer must be able to receive text messages on the phone number listed in your support tool.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Notes:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span><span>Customers who don&rsquo;t have access to the email or phone, but do know their password, can sign in at <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/verifyme" target="_blank"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/verifyme</span></a> with their password.</span></span></span></li>
	<li class="ng-scope"><strong><span><span><span>Click2Call/Click2Chat</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Some customers may come in already verified via Click2Call or Click2Chat. These customers should be treated as already having passed verification.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><strong>Important reminder on personal data:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><strong><span><span><span>Never</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> share or provide the customer with any personal data, masked email, phone information, or any information shown in your support tool. This information can only be used to confirm the information provided by the customer.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Always receive personal data from the customer and then verify what you see on the tool.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You can <strong>only</strong> share some information without the customer being verified. This information is provided to help the customer locate the correct account <em><span>only </span><span>when the customer provided a Microsoft account</span></em>: You can share the status of the account as seen under the <strong><span>Issue</span></strong> and <strong><span>Description</span></strong> section or the last two digits of the phone number or email domain under <strong><span>Security Info</span></strong>. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Do not share anything if the customer only shared a phone number, gamer tag, first/last name, or account found when searching by credit card.</span></span></span></span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If a customer provides just a Service Request (SR) number, you can&rsquo;t provide any additional information regarding steps taken, or resolution status of the escalation, without customer passing account verification.</span></span></span></span><span> </span><span> </span></span></li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Procedure</h3>

<h4><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1&nbsp;Setting expectations</h4>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Always set the customer&rsquo;s expectation that you&rsquo;ll need to secure the account before continuing to assist them.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Explain to the customer that you need to verify their account to protect their personal information from phishing and social engineering. You can use the following messaging to set expectations:</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><em><span><span><span>&quot;Before I move forward, I need to send you a code, which you will need to read back to me to verify your Microsoft account. I can send you the code with three options: website, email, or phone text message. If by phone, you may be charged for the text message, depending on your service plan. Which option is most convenient for you?&quot; </span></span></span></em></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>If the customer worries about the account verification process or does not recall having done the process before, you can reassure them by explaining:</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em><span>We take your security very seriously. To protect you and the information on your account, we do that by sending a code to a place you&rsquo;ve already registered within your account. This is like the way you confirm a password reset request.&rdquo;</span></em></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><a id="2.2" name="2.2"></a>2.2&nbsp;Email, phone, or web personal data verification</span></span></span></span></h4>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Work with the customer to select the best method to verify them: Either receiving a code to their <strong>email</strong> or <strong>phone</strong> number or generating a code through the <strong>web</strong> sign-on method.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>In case the customer chooses the <strong>email</strong> or <strong>web</strong> verification method, inform the customer that it will require them to be near a device/PC that can access the internet while still on the call.</span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>In case the customer chooses the <strong>web</strong> verification method, also instruct the customer that they will need to sign in with their Microsoft account. </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>The option to validate through a web sign-on is always available regardless of the information you have available in your support tool.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span><span><span>Determine which email or phone number to send the code to.</span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>You should first look at the redacted email or phone number to make sure it matches the Microsoft account you just searched in your support tool (comparing the first and last characters/digits). </span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>If you still cannot determine the correct account, you can use the </span></span></span><span lang="FR"><span><span>customer&rsquo;s </span></span></span><span><span><span>f</span></span></span><span lang="FR"><span><span>irst </span></span></span><span><span><span>n</span></span></span><span lang="FR"><span><span>ame</span></span></span><span><span><span> and </span></span></span><span><span><span>s</span></span></span><span lang="FR"><span><span>tate of </span></span></span><span><span><span>r</span></span></span><span lang="FR"><span><span>esidence</span></span></span><span><span><span> to verify the appropriate account. </span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong></strong></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: You may want to send the code to <strong>all</strong> the emails and phone numbers associated with the account. However, prior to doing so, the customer must be asked if they would like to utilize this option and be proactively provided an explanation as to what the send all option entails &ndash; sending a code simultaneously to both their e-mail alias and phone via text. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A customer utilising this option may incur a cost for receiving an SMS message depending on the plan they are using.</span></span></span></span></span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Following this explanation, the customer must confirm their choice to use this option before you proceed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
