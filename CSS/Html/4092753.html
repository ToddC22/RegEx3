<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>Azure for Students (170p) is a special offer that <span>will be available only for students</span> <span> </span><span> that are 18 years of age or older and attend an accredited, degree-granting four-year educational institution as a full-time student or faculty in a STEM-related field.</span> It is an addition (not a replacement) to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3048361/azure-support---imagine-formally-known-as-dreamspark" target="_blank">Azure for Students Starter (formerly Imagine) subscription</a>. This offer consists of a $100 USD credit (provided via Sponsorship benefit) that can be used for 12 months and Free Services equal to the ones available on Free Account.</p>

<h3><strong>Policy</strong></h3>

<h4><strong>Data Migration/SOT</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>There are no limitations on data migration in/out of the Azure for Student subscription. Use the process defined in TSG<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2856526/asms---account-portal-account-subs-migration-simple-data-migration" managed-link="" target="_blank"> 2856526.</a>&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Subscription Ownership Transfers(SOT) are not allowed for this offer type.</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Quota Increase</strong></h4>

<p>Quota cannot be increased for 170p. However is the customer&nbsp;attaches a Payment Instrument (PI) and requests the offer to be converted to Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) or another supported offer, then a quota request may be considered.&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>Offer Conversion</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>Conversions to 170p are not supported.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Self-serve conversions to a different Azure offer are not yet available for this offer. Customers must add a PI through the accounts portal and contact ASMS to convert the offer on their behalf.&nbsp;</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Pricing Details</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>This offer consists on a $100 USD credit (provided via Sponsorship) that can be used for 12 months and includes Free Services equal to the ones available on Free Account. </span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p><span>The offer is only rated in USD. No other currencies are supported.</span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Suspension</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>If a subscription consumes the $100 USD at any point during the 12 months, the subscription will automatically be suspended including the Free Services. </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Once suspended, subscription can be converted to PAYG, but only with Support help. There are plans for a self-serve conversion, but no ETA. </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If subscription has been suspended, ASMS must check for registration status in AIRS. Only if active may the subscription be re-activated. If subscription was previously connected to that registration, (meaning no SOT or offer conversion to 170P) then it will re-connect and Sponsorship team does not need to be engaged.&nbsp; Only if there appears to be zero consumption of sponsorship value does Sponsorship team need to be engaged to evaluate a disconnect scenario.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>When Azure for Students subscription is disabled, please check the activity log in CMAT and AIRS account status to get details. If the user has been disabled for <strong>Monetary Cap</strong> or <strong>End of Entitlement</strong> they should be educated and converted to Pay As You Go subscription (this can be done only by ASMS support).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Only if customer has moved from one registration to another, you must work with the Azure Sponsorship team to get the sub connected in AIRS prior to re-enabling the sub. In this scenario please do not re-enable without Azure Sponsorship team approval.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Subscription Disabled</strong></h4>

<p>If a 170P subscription is disabled and no longer wishes to use Azure, but would like a copy of their services, follow the process below.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Engage your TA/PTA to review and for approval.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>TA/PTA will review and if required enable the subscription, and keep the Task to monitor.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>SE will inform the customer that their subscription will be temporarily enabled for 2 business days and on 3rd business day it will be disabled by system.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If customer is unresponsive, on 3rd day TA/PTA will disable the Subscription and complete the Task.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the customer requests to be enabled for additional days in order to download their data, they must first add a PI through the accounts portal and then contact ASMS to convert the offer on their behalf.</p>

<h4><strong>Monthly Usage&nbsp;&#8203;</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Since this offer has a $100 USD credit provided via Sponsorship benefit as normal with Sponsorship subscriptions.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>TA&#39;s can look up AIRS usage.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Customer Experience and Provisioning</strong></h4>

<p>The customer signup experience can be found <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/Sign-up%20Experience.docx?d=w90ffbe4381744c72b0c35e08d2cff0b8&amp;csf=1&amp;e=pMtyiI" target="_blank">here</a>. However, you should also note the following: &nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>This offer is available on Microsoft Account (MSA) and OrgID</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>No Credit Card needed for signup, but SMS challenge may apply&#8203; </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>To continue using Azure at the end of 12 months or after the customer has exhausted their $100 credit, whichever occurs first, customer must upgrade to a <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/offers/ms-azr-0003p/">Pay-As-You-Go subscription</a> by contacting Azure Support</span></p>
	</li>
</ul>
