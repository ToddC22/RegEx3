<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</h3>

<div>
<p><span><span><span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>All Xbox Live content and behavior is subject to the guidelines found in the </span></span></span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/servicesagreement/" target="_blank"><span><span>Microsoft Services Agreement</span></span></a><span><span><span> and the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/community-standards" managed-link="" target="_blank">Community Standards for Xbox</a>. Violating these guidelines can result in enforcement action from the Xbox Live Policy &amp; Enforcement Team (XBLPET).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>You should not address questions about specific enforcement actions or speculate why they occurred. All enforcement inquiries should be directed to enforcement.xbox.com, where the customer can review their enforcement history and submit a case review request to XBLPET</span></span></span></span></strong><span><strong><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Keep in mind the following rules about enforcement actions: </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Suspensions aren&rsquo;t based on report volume.</span></span></strong><span><span> An account will never be suspended simply because it reached a certain number of reports. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Suspensions may not happen right away.</span></span></strong><span><span> A customer&rsquo;s activity at the time of suspension may be unrelated to the reason for the suspension. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Note that many games and apps have their own codes of conduct and expectations concerning player behavior. Developers may implement policies and game-specific enforcements independent of XBLPET. Direct questions about game-specific enforcements to the appropriate developer or publisher. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Suggested advocate scripting (general) </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;Your Xbox Live account has received an enforcement due to violations of the Microsoft Services Agreement. Microsoft Support cannot provide specific details about individual suspensions, but please visit enforcement.xbox.com to see additional details about the action and check if you&rsquo;re eligible to have the case reviewed by the Policy &amp; Enforcement Team.&rdquo; </span></span></span></em></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>For answers to specific questions, refer customers to </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">enforcement.xbox.com</a><span><span><span>. Do not refer customers to support.xbox.com, the Xbox.com forums, or other resources.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="2" name="2"></a>2.&nbsp;Enforcement notifications</h3>

<p><span><span>When an account is subject to an enforcement action, it receives two notifications: </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><strong><span>An Xbox Live message</span></strong><span>&nbsp;sent only to the affected account.</span></li>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><strong><span>An email sent to </span>the </strong><strong><span>customer&rsquo;s Microsoft account</span></strong><span> and any associated parent account (when applicable).</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>The Xbox Live message, sent only to the affected account, is viewable on all Xbox platforms (Xbox One, Xbox 360, the Xbox app, Xbox SmartGlass, and Xbox.com). On Xbox One, the message contains two action buttons: </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><strong><span>More information</span></strong><span>, which links to a web-based copy of the email notification.</span></li>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><strong><span>Enforcement.xbox.com</span></strong><span>, which links directly to the enforcement website.</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Both notifications instruct the affected </span>customer <span>to visit enforcement.xbox.com. This website is the customer&rsquo;s primary resource for learning more about the action.<span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In very rare situations, XBLPET may deliberately choose not to send a notification to an account. In these cases, the enforcement&rsquo;s impact remains the same and customers can review them on enforcement.xbox.com.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Enforcement.xbox.com and case review</h3>

<p><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Enforcement.xbox.com</a><span> is the primary </span>customer <span>resource for enforcement information. Customers can sign-in to view:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Their </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/enforcement/showenforcementhistory" managed-link="" target="_blank">enforcement history</a></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>When their suspension ends</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>What type of violation occurred</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>How it affects their account</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>The website also outlines enforcement policies, describes how to submit a report, and answers frequent questions. </span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A customer may also request a <strong><span>case review </span></strong>on </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">enforcement.xbox.com</a><span><span><span>, where they can send questions about an enforcement directly to XBLPET, who will review the case and provide an understanding of the action.</span></span></span></span><span> </span></p>

<p><span>To be eligible for a case review, the account must have an active (current) suspension that:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Has a </span>duration greater than 24 hours.</li>
	<li><span>Was</span> issued <span>within</span> the last 12 months.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>Forced gamertag changes are also eligible for inquiry for 12 months from the date of the enforcement. Some</span> enforcements<span>, such as content takedowns</span> and <span>24-hour suspensions, are not eligible for review due</span> to the <span>minimal impact of</span> the <span>enforcement. </span></p>

<p>To request a <span>case review</span>, the <span>customer must: </span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Sign in to<span> <strong>enforcement.xbox.com</strong> </span>with the account that received the enforcement and select the large <span>tile</span> with <span>the</span> hammer icon<span> to</span> view the account&rsquo;s<span> enforcement history.<br>
	<br>
	<span asset="4014337" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4014337]</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Find the enforcement action they would like reviewed&nbsp;and select <strong>Apply for Review</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Read the Case Review Terms of Use and agree by clicking the checkbox and selecting <strong>Agree</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Complete a short questionnaire about Community Standards. Two unsuccessful completions will temporarily prevent the customer from submitting the review. After successful completion, select the <strong>green arrow</strong> icon.</span></p>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Ask any questions about the enforcement or note any details (up to 500 characters) that may provide XBLPET with additional context. When complete, select <strong><span>Submit</span></strong>.<br>
	<br>
	XBLPET will typically respond to a Case Review within 24 hours. In some cases, XBLPET may request additional information from the customer.</span></span></span></span></span><span> </span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>At any time, the <span>customer</span> may view the status of the case review by signing in to enforcement.xbox.com and checking the account&rsquo;s </strong><strong><span>enforcement history.</span></strong></p>

<h3><a id="4" name="4"></a>4.&nbsp;Enforcement types</h3>

<p><span>Enforcements may apply to an account, club, or Xbox device. Enforcement types include:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><strong><span>Content takedowns:</span></strong><span> resulting in the removal of specific inappropriate content, such as a screenshot, Activity Feed item, or video.</span></li>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><strong><span>Forced gamertag changes:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>replacing an account&rsquo;s inappropriate gamertag with a new system-generated gamertag.</span></li>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><strong><span>Communications suspensions:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>restricting an account&rsquo;s ability to use voice and text communication features for a specified period. </span></li>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><strong><span>Account suspensions:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>restricting an account&rsquo;s ability to use Xbox Live features for a specified period. Permanent account suspensions prevent the account from signing in entirely. </span></li>
	<li><span><span> </span></span><strong><span>Device bans:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>blocking a specific console or Xbox Live device from connecting to Xbox Live. <strong><span> </span></strong></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span>Note </span></strong><span>Due to their severe nature,<strong> </strong>device bans are not reviewable via case review and&nbsp;are not displayed in the customer&rsquo;s enforcement history. Customers who have device bans receive a notification when they try to sign in. They can refer to the </span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://enforcement.xbox.com/home/howto#sub-topic0-3" managed-link="" target="_blank">Device bans page</a><span> for more information.</span></p>

<h3><a id="5" name="5"></a>5. Support guidelines</h3>

<p><strong><span>Don&rsquo;t apologize for the enforcement action. </span></strong><span><br>
If </span>an enforcement <span>was issued, it&rsquo;s because</span> the account<span> violated the Microsoft Services Agreement </span>and <span>harmed</span> other <span>players</span> or <span>Xbox Live. Apologizing for the </span>enforcement <span>or its impact undermines efforts to uphold Xbox Live policies</span> and <span>disregards the negative effects of</span> <span>the customer&rsquo;s actions on others.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Don&rsquo;t speculate why the customer was </span>suspended</strong><strong><span>. </span></strong><span><br>
While a customer may provide information that makes it</span> easy to speculate <span>why the enforcement occurred, speculative answers</span> can ultimately <span>misinform</span> the customer. Similarly,<span> don&rsquo;t speculate the necessity or </span>accuracy of <span>an enforcement</span> based<span> solely</span> on the customer&rsquo;s information. <span>Direct the customer to enforcement.xbox.com to learn more about their situation. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Don&rsquo;t speculate</span> about what will or </strong><strong><span>won&rsquo;t</span> result in a suspension.</strong><strong> </strong><br>
The Microsoft Services Agreement and Community Standards don&rsquo;t describe exactly when a suspension will be issued or what type of enforcement will apply. Providing uninformed or speculative guidance about what is or is not ban-worthy can inadvertently encourage a customer to create content or take part in an activity that will result in a suspension or may discourage a customer from activities that are not actually against the rules.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t compensate customers for time or content lost due to a suspension. </strong><br>
Never inform customers that we will provide compensation or subscription codes for lost subscription time, content, or CSV because of an enforcement. <strong>An enforcement action is a direct result of a violation of the Community Standards for Xbox and does not entitle the recipient to compensation</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t direct customers to dispute charges with their bank or financial institution. </strong><br>
This sets the false expectation that they may be able to recoup the lost funds. As Microsoft often disputes chargebacks, the chargeback may be reversed, further frustrating the customer.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t</strong><strong> assure customers that they will be unsuspended. </strong><br>
Customers may have a convincing explanation for their suspension. But regardless of the situation, you should never attempt to alter the suspension or promise its reversal.&nbsp;<strong>Enforcements are rarely reversed or reduced.&nbsp;</strong>Users who seek more information about their enforcement should be directed to enforcement.xbox.com, but don&rsquo;t set the expectation that XBLPET will lift or alter the suspension.</p>

<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t promise customers that they can receive a free gamertag change. </strong><br>
Forced gamertag changes automatically assign a new gamertag to the affected customer and do not entitle the customer to a free gamertag change. If a customer requests a free change, direct them to change their gamertag via the standard process.</p>
