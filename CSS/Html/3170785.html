<p><span><span><span><span><span>Promotional codes are minted or created for redemption in a specific account country/currency combination. However, promotional code are considered global, therefore, if an advertiser redeems a code in a country/currency combination that is different from their account, Microsoft Advertising will convert the code value to the currency of the account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Coupon codes:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>

<p><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The account must meet all the following conditions to qualify:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>For retention codes, the account must have primary payment method that meets payment method requirements.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>For performance-based coupons (PBC), all payment method types are eligible.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Advertisers may not be able to redeem a promotional code if their account does not align with the promotional code type or offer validity period. There is error messaging that will let both the customer and advocate know if the promotional code is expired, not a Microsoft Advertising promotional code, has already been redeemed on that customer&rsquo;s account, or if it has been redeemed on another customer&rsquo;s account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Note for services:</strong>&nbsp;We can apply a coupon to an account after a consultation, even if the account is over 90 days old. This is true for scenarios where the customer appears to be committed to working with us and using our platform moving forward. For this scenario, TA approval is not needed.</p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. ﻿How to apply a code </span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Assist the advertiser in applying the code using the steps outlined in </span></span></span><a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50829/3" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US"><span>Microsoft Advertising promotional offers (coupons)</span></span></a><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>See <strong>Reactive Support Ticket handling &gt; Customer Communications &gt; Sharing Help</strong> content for localization guidelines. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>After a code is added, the user will receive popup confirmation that the code was successfully applied. The coupon balance will appear on the details and billing page as &lsquo;coupon balance&rsquo; within five to ten&nbsp;minutes and the customer (super admin) will receive an email confirmation. For the promotion code to be visible in the coupon balance, the user may need to refresh the page.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Starting September 2018, marketing and engineering teams will begin testing auto-PBC&nbsp;codes that will prepopulate into the account during the sign-up process if the customer clicks the sign-up link from enabled marketing offer pages. Coupon abuse will be monitored throughout the pilot and its possible repeat customer sign-ups will have the coupons removed retroactively from their account. Escalate to Global Support to confirm if a customer was affected by the pilot and automated abuse/coupon removal policies.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> Promotional codes CANNOT be applied through API.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>How to tell if a promotion code has been applied to the account: </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Navigate to the <strong>Billing</strong> tab. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select the appropriate account from the <strong>Selected account</strong> dropdown (note that no information will show if <strong>All Accounts</strong> is selected). </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You will see the coupon balance on the <strong>How you pay</strong> Billing Tile if a coupon has been redeemed. Select the <strong>view details</strong> link next to the balance to view redemption details about the coupon such as date redeemed, class, code, expiration date, balance, and spend.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>After you add a coupon code, it can take up to ten&nbsp;minutes before the coupon balance is added to the account and appears on the Billing tab.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the advertiser has added the promotion code in the UI and does not see the code but has not received an error, advise the advertiser to refresh the page before proceeding to troubleshoot. Promotion codes can take up to ten&nbsp;minutes to show in the account, but the page must be refreshed for them to be visible.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> When troubleshooting errors where the code or offer has already been redeemed, Authorized Users may use the </span></span></span><span><a href="http://azsmartweb/couponlookup/Restricted/Lookup.aspx" target="_blank"><span><span><span>coupon lookup tool </span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>as needed to identify which accounts may have redeemed a code, no information about any other accounts can be divulged to any callers unless both accounts are properly authenticated.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Performance based coupons are enabled for all Microsoft Advertising markets, but not all markets have current promotions in PBC form. For an up-to-date list of PBC promotions, see&nbsp;KB </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/2643959" managed-link="" target="_blank">2643959 Informational: Microsoft Advertising: Current Promotions in Market</a><span><span><span>.

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Customer&rsquo;s CID must be no older than 30 days old.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The spend value <strong>does not</strong>&nbsp;include tax. Advise advertisers to submit offline payments large enough to accommodate tax deductions for prepay accounts in taxable markets. </span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p>When the customer receives a coupon offer from Microsoft, they may be provided a link to sign in and redeem their coupon. This process is known as automated coupons or <em>auto-PBC</em> (though this process may also be used for retention code redemption as well).</p>

<p>Automated coupon redemption links are single use. The automated coupon redemption link is specific to the customer, account, and coupon code. The coupon code (cco) may also be redeemed manually, if necessary.</p>

<p><strong>Example link:</strong> <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://ads.microsoft.com/?signout=true&amp;msg=sessionexpired&amp;RURL=https%3a%2f%2fads.microsoft.com%2fcc%2fpaymentmethods%3fcid%3d159302515%26aid%3d139172843%26cco%3d411519456AA14963&amp;ccuisrc=4" managed-link="" target="_blank">ads.microsoft.com/cc/paymentmethods</a></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="9" name="9"></a>9. ﻿Performance based coupons FAQ</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What are performance based coupons (PBC)? </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Performance based coupons (PBC) require customers to add a valid payment instrument and spend ($X)&nbsp;before receiving ($Y)&nbsp;in Microsoft Advertising credit. The goal of PBC is to reduce fraud and to increase the % of valuable acquisitions that bring money to Microsoft Advertising. Advertisers who do not perform in 30 days tend to churn out completely, resulting in a steep survival curve. PBC enables new advertisers to perform faster because it requires customers to start spending sooner if they want to unlock the free credit. The sooner advertisers start to see performance, the sooner they become more invested with the product and thus become less likely to churn out. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What happens if we give an advertiser who already has a PBC, a retention coupon?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Retention codes override PBCs and pause their offer, which could have an impact on whether the advertiser is able to redeem the offer. For example, if an advertiser with an active PBC also receives a retention code from support they will immediately start spending on the retention code with the expiration clock still ticking on their PBC. Once they spend the retention code, they will resume spending on the PBC but will lose any amount they are unable to spend on the PBC when it expires (usually 90 days after being issued).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can advocates&nbsp;add the PBC to the advertiser&rsquo;s account?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes, if a customer is eligible for PBC, you can add the code on behalf of the customer, as desired. It used to be that the user who adds the coupon receives the emails about the promotion, but this is no longer accurate. No matter who applies the coupon, the promotional emails will be sent to the advertiser. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Are the PBC emails available to view in UCM?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Not currently, but it is an open feature request.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: If the advertiser has started spending, but hasn&rsquo;t added the PBC, will the previous spend apply to the amount they need to reach&nbsp;for the coupon to start?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: No. The spend required&nbsp;to apply the PBC is calculated from the time the PBC is added to the account.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How many PBCs can be given to one customer?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>The policy for replacements is one per customer but redemption is managed at the account level. If you are aware (through previous ASD tickets) that the customer may already have been given a PBC, do not issue another one. Check the XIDs for the prior tickets to confirm whether they&rsquo;ve already received a code before issuing a replacement.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: The policy for replacements is one per customer, but what about agencies that have their customers set up with accounts under their customer shell?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> For agencies who have customers set up as accounts under their shell, we can give coupons for each account that is under 30 days old. There will be system monitoring to prevent abuse.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Does adding a prepaid balance of $25 count towards the spend to activate a code?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> No. Spend is counted as money spent on ad delivery, not added to a prepay balance.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>The below internal FAQ is related to Auto PBC &ndash; live as of 2018.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What is expected with the Auto PBC feature? </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong></strong></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: This feature streamlines the process to redeem a performance-based coupon by automatically applying a coupon code to eligible customer accounts during the sign-up process.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Who is this feature targeted at? </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: New SMB customers just signing-up for Microsoft Advertising coming from specific Marketing campaigns that offer a performance-based coupon upon sign-up. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How will this feature help internal partners? </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Auto PBC is expected to decrease inbound coupon inquiries and allow customers to go live with coupon offers much faster. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Will all coupons be automatically applied once this feature is released? </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: No. Only performance-based coupons used for new customer acquisitions will be automatically applied if the customer is signing up from a special Marketing offer. Other coupons, such as those used to incentivize feature adoption, will be tackled in a later release. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How do we decide if a customer qualifies for the new customer promotional offer? </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> We will be asking for the customer&rsquo;s website in sign-up and we will use this to check if the customer has ever advertised with Microsoft Advertising before. If we find that the website has advertised on Microsoft Advertising before, the customer will be ineligible for the offer (according to the coupon offer details, the promotional credit is only valid for customers that have never advertised on Microsoft Advertising before). </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How long does the customer have to use the promotional credit once it is automatically applied? </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>A</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>: The customer needs to add their payment method within 30 days to successfully redeem the coupon. Once the coupon is redeemed, the customer has 90 days to unlock spend and spend the free credit. </span></span></span></span></p>
