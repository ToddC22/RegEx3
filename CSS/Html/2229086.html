<h3>2.&nbsp;Process</h3>

<h4><span><span><span><span><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1 Damaged in transit/Damaged products </span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>There are occasions when a customer will receive a package that has sustained damages that may not have been reported or a product that was in less-than-perfect condition when it left the service center. To help these customers, it is important to document the occurrence for the quickest resolution and best customer experience.<br>
<br>
As all repaired or exchanged serialized devices receive the longer of the remainder of the original warranty or a 90-day repair warranty and accessories receive the unbundled accessory warranty for their country (see KB </span></span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/967172" managed-link="" target="_blank">967172 Procedure: Xbox: Global Xbox repair and fulfillment information and options</a><span><span><span><span>), this section only applies within the first 30 days after receipt of an item from the service center. Beyond that period, the item should be considered defective;&nbsp;see </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><a bookmark-id="2.2" href="#2.2" managed-link="">defective products</a>&nbsp;section for more information</span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>1. Verify the customer Microsoft account information. See KB&nbsp;</span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4506610" managed-link="" target="_blank">4506610&nbsp;Procedure: Microsoft account verification</a><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>2. Request the service request number (SR) for the order in question.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>3. If the packaging is not damaged, ask the customer to inspect the contents for cosmetic, structural, or water damage. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>If there is no cosmetic, structural, or water damage to the product, follow the troubleshooting in&nbsp;</span></span><a bookmark-id="2.2" href="#2.2" managed-link=""><span><span>defective products</span></span></a><span><span> section.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>If there is only cosmetic damage (scratches or marks in the plastic, uneven color on the outer plastic shell, or so dirty or dusty that it cannot easily be cleaned) and no structural or water damage to the product, email the customer requesting that they reply to the email and attach photos of the product that include the damaged areas to document the issue.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Important:</strong> Photos must be attached to the reply, not pasted into the body of the reply. Recommend that the customer reply from a laptop or desktop, as most cell phones paste photos into the email instead of attaching them. Pasted photos will be stripped from the reply and not usable for this purpose.<br>
<br>
Have the customer test the device for functionality. If the product is functional ask the customer if they will accept the product. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><span>If they agree, note in the SR accordingly, and then save and close the SR.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer insists on a replacement accessory, offer to place another accessory exchange order. As the warranty does not cover cosmetic damage, standard shipping options apply. If no free of charge SKUs are available, create a new SR and skip to step 5 to engage the Offline Team.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer insists on a replacement console and is in an exchange only country (see KB </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/967172" managed-link="" target="_blank">967172 Procedure: Xbox: Global Xbox repair and fulfillment information and options</a><span><span>), create a new SR and process a new exchange (repair) order for the device.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
