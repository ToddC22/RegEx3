<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. General information</h3>

<p><strong>Pre-orders</strong><br>
Pre-orders are products and content that are not yet available for immediate delivery or download.</p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h3><span>2. Payment authorization of pre-orders</span></h3>

<h4><span><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1 Process for authorization</span></h4>

<p><span>Customers can purchase products available for pre-order using credit on their Microsoft account, a debit/credit card, or both. They will be charged at different times depending on how they pay:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong><span>Microsoft account credit (CSV)</span></strong><span>. If the customer pays for their pre-order completely with credit from the Microsoft account, the credit will be subtracted right away. </span></li>
	<li><strong><span>Debit or credit card</span></strong><span>. Pre-orders made using just a debit or credit card won&rsquo;t be charged until about 10&nbsp;days before the product is released. </span></li>
	<li><strong><span>A combination of account credit (CSV) and a debit/credit card</span></strong><span>. If the customer doesn&rsquo;t have enough credit to cover the whole cost of the pre-order, they can combine payments. This will act the same as a pre-order with a debit or credit card and won&rsquo;t be charged until about 10&nbsp;days before the product is released. </span></li>
</ul>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><span><a id="2.2" name="2.2"></a>2.2 Method of payment</span></h4>

<p><strong><span>A combination of account credit (CSV) and a debit/credit card</span></strong><span><span><span><span><span><br>
If the customer used a combination of account credit and a credit card, their account credit and the card will be charged about 10&nbsp;days before the product launches. The customer will receive an email confirming that the payment was collected successfully and, if it is a physical product, include a tracking number for the shipment (not applicable for digital goods). If the customer has spent all the CSV since the pre-order, then the full amount will be charged to the debit/credit card. </span></span></span></span> </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Debit/credit card only</span></strong><span><br>
If the customer used their credit/debit card to place the pre-order, they will be billed around 10 days before the products launches. The customer will receive an email confirming that the payment was collected successfully&nbsp;and include a tracking number&nbsp;to track the pre-order shipment. </span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><span><a id="2.3" name="2.3"></a>2.3 Authorization failure on Pre-Orders</span></h4>

<p><span>If for any reason the card payment failed, or the payment couldn&rsquo;t be taken, the customer will receive a notification that their payment couldn&rsquo;t be taken. If this happens, the customer should: </span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Sign into their account at <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing/payments" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com/billing/payments</a>.</span></li>
	<li><span>Review their current payment options to ensure that everything is correct. If the customer needs to add or remove a payment method, they can do this here.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>The customer can also select a different payment method for an individual purchase by doing the following: </span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Sign into their account at <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://account.microsoft.com/billing" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com/billing</a>.</span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Within the order history, find the pre-ordered product and select <strong>Change how you pay</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span>On the <strong>Pick another way to pay</strong> screen, the customer can either choose a different payment method, or add a new one.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>In both cases, we will attempt to bill the customer again before the product launches, so they won&rsquo;t lose any pre-order bonuses (if applicable).</span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If the customer wants to cancel a pre-ordered product and the payment method is still being processed by the bank, you may need to wait a day or two before Microsoft can refund the purchase. If you are processing a refund, make sure that the pre-order didn&rsquo;t ship to the customer. If it has already shipped, then the customer would need to return the product to receive a refund. </span></span></span></span><span> </span></p>

<h4><span><a id="2.4" name="2.4"></a>2.4&nbsp;Re-authorization process</span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the customer&rsquo;s payment method fails to authorize and they haven&rsquo;t been charged for any items on their order, then they will be eligible to update their payment method and attempt to re-authorize. Customers that fall into this process will experience the following: </span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Customer receives payment update e-mail and selects the link to <strong>update</strong>. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Customer signs in with their Microsoft account.</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> The customer MUST use the Microsoft account that is associated with the order.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>A page appears asking the customer to update their payment information. The customer can do the following:</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li>&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>Use an existing payment method.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Edit an existing payment method and then use it. If the customer is updating an expired card, they should enter this as a brand-new payment instrument (PI). The CVV (three-digit security code) will <em>need</em> to be added, and the system will not ask for this for expired cards. This will cause the PI to fail.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Add a new payment method and then use it.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Once updated, the customer will see a Confirmation page, outlining the order information (the order has not been placed yet).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>Customer selects <strong>Confirm your order</strong></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Order success &ndash; Order is placed, customer arrives on the Thank You page with their receipt.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Authorization failed &ndash; Order was not placed, and the card failed authorization. The customer will go back to step 3 and attempt to update the payment information again.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Customers have a limited number of attempts and a limited timeline</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Customers will have a maximum of two (2) attempts, or 7 days (whichever happens first), to authorize their payment method. After a 2nd failed attempt, the customer will no longer be able to update their payment method, and the order/product will be cancelled.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>

<h3>4. FAQ</h3>

<h4><span><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 How can customers pay for a pre-order? </span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>A credit card is required for all pre-orders, but the card will not be charged until the order is shipped or the product is made available for download.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The order cannot be charged and completed if the card expires between the date the pre-order is placed and the date the item becomes available for purchase. Explain to the customers&nbsp;that their billing and contact information must always be current. If the customer&rsquo;s card expires before the pre-order is shipped, Microsoft will make multiple attempts to reach out to the customer informing them of their card expiring before the pre-order ship date.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><span><a id="4.2" name="4.2"></a>4.2 When will customers get their confirmation email? </span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Customers will get a confirmation email within the same day of ordering. This email will include the transaction information and any special instructions that may be needed for purchase. This email will also include the order number, the date the order was placed, and the release date of the product if it is known.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
If customers do not receive their confirmation email within 24 hours, tell the customer to call us for their order status update. (You should provide regional Microsoft store contact information. The information can be found on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/store" target="_blank">www.microsoft.com/store</a><span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span><span>)</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><a id="4.3" name="4.3"></a>4.3 When will customers receive their physical product? </span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Most pre-orders will ship either before or by the GA (General Availability) date, if known. Product pages will generally list a &ldquo;ships by&rdquo; date if possible. Physical products will be shipped Monday through Friday during normal business hours. The shipping timeline is based on the shipping method that was selected for the purchase.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span></span></span><span><span><span><strong>Note: </strong><em>US/Canada only</em>: If a customer pre-orders a device and purchases Microsoft Complete, the Complete warranty will activate when the products ships at GA, NOT at the time of pre-order.

<br>
The advertised price for pre-order items may increase or decrease prior to the date the product is released to the public. However, customers will only be charged the lowest price offered between the time the pre-order was placed and the date the product is released to the public. Also, the credit card won&rsquo;t be charged until the download is available or the product is shipped. The pre-order price guarantee only applies to pre-order items and prices offered on Microsoft Store. It does not apply to items and prices advertised by other sellers, prices inclusive of taxes, shipping charges, or typographical errors. For pre-order offers based on an estimated price rather than the official price, the pre-order price guarantee only applies to and will be based on the official price for the item when announced.</span></p>

<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span><span>In this scenario, the customer&#39;s payment method expired before the release date of the game and the customer has forgotten to update their payment method in their order before the release date.<br>
<br>
With all pre-orders, a stub (thumbnail) of the item is available on the customer&#39;s system when a pre-order is first made. The item or game will not work until the release date. A generic &quot;do not have license error&quot; may appear.<br>
<br>
Ten days before the release date of a pre-order, the customer&#39;s payment method will be charged the full amount of the purchase. Customers will receive email notifications to update their payment method to complete the order purchase.<br>
<br>
If the customer&#39;s payment goes into a dunning state such as expired credit card, this will require the customer intervention. If the customer does not take corrective actions, the order will be cancelled before the release date.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="CxSpMiddle"><span><span><span><span>You will assist the customer to purchase the game, since the original purchase pre-order has been cancelled.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>For missing pre-order downloadable content, you will do a Make It Right on downloadable content that the customer was supposed to get if they had successfully received the pre-order.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="4.13" name="4.13"></a>4.13 When is the customer&rsquo;s card charged for the full amount?</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Microsoft store doesn&#39;t charge customers for preordering products. It does submit a token authorization that will validate the customer&rsquo;s card by placing an authorization up to $1 depending on the bank&rsquo;s policy. In North America this is typically $0 and Rest of World is typically $1. This token authorization will drop from the customer&#39;s card in 7-10 business days based on their bank&rsquo;s policy. The full value of the product will be charged shortly before the product ship date or available for download.<br>
<br>
In the scenario where the customer makes a purchase of an in-stock item (physical or digital) with a pre-order item, the customer will get pre-authorized for the full amount of the in-stock item only and will get charged for the pre-order when it&rsquo;s shipped or available for download.<br>
<br>
Also:<br>
<br>
Debit cards are handled the same way as credit cards.<br>
<br>
PayPal does a pre-authorization for the full amount. </span></span></span></span></p>
