However, before you try to stop Folder Redirection, you must first enable the <strong class='uiterm'>Redirect the folder back to the local userprofile location when policy is removed</strong> Group Policy setting. <br><br><span class='text-base'>Important</span> After you modify a GPO and enable the <span class='text-base'>Redirect the folder back to the local userprofile location when policy is removed</span> Group Policy setting, all users who you want to stop Folder Redirection must log off and then log on again.  This is to make sure  that  the updated GPO settings are applied before you stop Folder Redirection. <br><br>To stop Folder Redirection, follow these steps:<ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Enable the <span class='text-base'>Redirect the folder back to the local userprofile location when policy is removed</span> Group Policy setting.

You must apply these changes  to the user&#39;s computer before you go to the next step.</li><li>When all users have logged off and then logged back on, and the updated GPO for Folder Redirection has been applied, use one of the following methods to stop Folder Redirection:<ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Method 1: Remove the user from the  organizational unit where the  folder redirection GPO is applied to a different organizational unit  that does not redirect folders. To do this, follow these steps:<br><span class='text-base'>Important</span> Move the user accounts, do not delete the GPO.<ol class='sbody-alpha_list'><li>In the console tree of <strong class='uiterm'>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong>, right-click <strong class='uiterm'><strong class='sbody-strong'>DomainName</strong></strong>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Find</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong class='uiterm'>Users, Contacts, and Groups</strong> in the <strong class='uiterm'>Find</strong> box.</li><li>Type the name of the user account, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Find Now</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>Search results</strong> box, right-click the user account, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Move</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>Container to move object to</strong> box, locate a security group that does not have Folder Redirection policy enabled, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>OK</strong>. </li></ol></li><li>Method 2: Modify the security properties of the GPO to deny the user or group Read permissions and Apply Group Policy permissions to that GPO. This enables other GPO&#39;s to be applied to the user, while making sure that the folder redirection policy setting is not applied. To do this, follow these steps:<ol class='sbody-alpha_list'><li>Click <strong class='uiterm'>Start</strong>, point to <strong class='uiterm'>Programs</strong>, point to <strong class='uiterm'>Administrative Tools</strong>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>Active Directory Users and Computers</strong> console tree, right-click the organizational unit object or domain object that has the Group Policy Object whose security properties that you want to change, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Properties</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>Properties</strong> dialog box for the object, click the <strong class='uiterm'>Group Policy</strong> tab, select the GPO that you want to change from the list, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Properties</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>GPO Properties</strong> dialog box, click the <strong class='uiterm'>Security</strong> tab, and then change the permissions so that only the required users have the Read and Apply Group Policy permissions. For users where the GPO does not apply, make sure that you click to select the <strong class='uiterm'>Deny</strong> check box for  the Read and Apply Group Policy  permissions. Click <strong class='uiterm'>OK</strong> two times. <br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span> Make sure that Administrators have Read and Write permissions for the GPO.</li></ol></li></ul> After you use one of these methods, Folder Redirection will be stopped the next time that the user processes this GPO. By default, the  object is cached on the user&#39;s computer and will not be updated unless another change is detected. To force an update, you must follow these additional steps: <ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Create or modify a GPO that applies to the computers on which users who are affected by folder redirection policies log on. </li><li>Edit the GPO.</li><li>Under <strong class='uiterm'>Computer Configuration</strong>, expand <strong class='uiterm'>Administrative Templates</strong>. </li><li>Under <strong class='uiterm'>Administrative Templates</strong>, expand <strong class='uiterm'>System</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong class='uiterm'>System</strong>, select <strong class='uiterm'>Group Policy</strong>.</li><li>Double-click the Folder Redirection policy processing setting</li><li>Select the <strong class='uiterm'>Enabled</strong> option, and  then click to select the second check box. (Process even if the Group Policy objects have not changed.)</li><li>Exit the Group Policy Object Editor. Make sure that this new GPO applies to computer accounts for which users are using folder redirection. </li></ol>After you apply  this policy change, the computers can detect the updated folder redirection policy and will honor the changes that have been made  to stop using folder redirection.<br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span> After a Folder Redirection GPO is applied to a user profile, those Group Policy settings are retained locally on the user&#39;s computer.   Group Policy settings are changed only when a new or modified GPO is applied to the user or computer.<br><br><span>For additional information about Folder Redirection, click the following article numbers to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br><br><div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-1' href='/en-us/help/232692'>232692 </a> Folder Redirection feature in Windows<br><br></div></span></li></ol><span><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Technical support for Windows x64 editions</h3> Your hardware manufacturer provides technical support and assistance for Microsoft Windows x64 editions.
