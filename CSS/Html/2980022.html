<h4><span class="text-base"><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a></span>1.1 Why is this happening?&nbsp;</h4>

<p><span class="text-base"></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>When we see activity in the customer&#39;s account that looks like someone else might have gotten their password, we lock the account down to prevent anyone from accessing personal information. The recovery process allows account owners to get back into their account while keeping others locked out.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customer will </span></span></span><span><span><span>see this message when<strong> </strong>we have seen some activity on their account that is out of the ordinary enough for us to take measures to lock their account until they can take action. Possible causes could be excessive fa<span>iled login attempts, login from unknown devices, login from unknown location, or that we suspected your account has been taken over by someone. </span>The flag is permanent until the user takes the action.</span></span></span><span><span><span><br>
<br>
If a customer asks how their account might have been compromised, say that we cannot tell for certain that it was compromised or how, but there are some things you can do to make your account more secure at <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/security" target="_blank"><span>Microsoft account security</span></a>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

				<li>Please note the 16-character max limit if you have an Xbox360. If you don&rsquo;t then you can make a longer password if it&rsquo;s easier for you to remember a longer one.&nbsp;</li>
