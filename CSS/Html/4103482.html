			<p>When applied these keywords will be applied to every search you do. You can add or remove these at any time by navigating to Search Preferences.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Note: Portals are often one or multiple keywords applied. Eventually portals will be removed and only keywords will be used.&nbsp;</p>

			<p><strong>Details</strong></p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Why do I not see the most relevant product at the top of the Product filters after searching?</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>To make your search more accurate use quotes &quot;&quot; around the specific items in your search you want to be looked at.</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>

			<p>For example:&nbsp; I want to search Windows 10 Support Boundaries, I would enter my search as follows: &quot;Windows 10&quot; support boundaries</p>

			<p>&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>Why is Knowledge defaulting to AND with searches?</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>We use a default AND when searching. When a user enters <em>windows xbox</em>&nbsp; in knowledge the results returned must have both windows and xbox in each result returned.</p>

			<p>If a user wishes to change this they can use the operators to do OR and NOT. See the &quot;<a bookmark-id="operators" href="#operators" managed-link="">What search <strong>operators </strong>are <strong>available </strong>in Knowledge?</a>&quot; section.</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p>What determines what <strong>Products </strong>I see initially in the <strong>list of options</strong>?</p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>&nbsp;The initial set of Products you see under the Product Filter are the top 10 products (those with the largest number of content associated to your search). The see more /see less expands this list to the top 100 products</p>

			<p>Note: Products are a metadata point on article creation. Not all articles have Products mapped to them while being authored. Hence on seaching for &quot;Window 10&quot; you may not see that as the top Porduct filter.&nbsp;</p>

						<p>-</p>

						<p>The NOT operator is a minus sign. For example, wifi -surface will search for documents that have the wifi term and do not have surface.</p>

						<p>&quot; &quot;</p>

						<p>The phrase operator encloses a phrase in quotation marks. For example, Surface wifi (without quotes) would search for documents containing Surface and/or wifi anywhere in any order, &quot;Surface wifi&quot; (with quotes) will only match documents that contains that whole phrase together and in that order (text analysis still applies).</p>
						</td>

						<p>()</p>

						<p>The precedence operator encloses the string in parentheses. For example, surface +(wifi | bluetooth) will search for documents containing the surface term and either wifi or bluetooth (or both).</p>

			<td><span>How does the search result ranking work?</span></td>

			<p><span><span>We have implemented the following scoring profile (weighting) when searching against Portico content:</span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span><span>Article ID x 5</span></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span><span>Article Title x 1.5</span></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span><span>Keywords x2</span></span></span></span></span></p>
			<span><span><span><span><span><span>In essence meaning if you search with an article ID number the article with that ID will always be at the top and articles that reference that ID or contain that number will be lower in the rank. If you search with a term and that term exists in the Title or Keyword of the article will rank higher than an article</span></span></span></span></span></span></td>

			<td>
			<p>I&#39;m searching for an exact article title why isn&#39;t it showing up as the top result? It shows up later in the list</p>
			</td>

			<p>This is because if you are searching for an exact match then you need to you quotes around the search.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Example: I want to find the article :<span>Consumer Support Boundaries: Microsoft account Sign In or Sign Up and Windows Hello</span></p>

			<p><strong>Searching</strong>:</p>

			<ul>
