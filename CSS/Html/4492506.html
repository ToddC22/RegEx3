<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This TSG provides information about assets and how they behave in Modern Commerce.</p>

<p>An asset represents a footprint of ownership and the management of their associated child assets, typically acquired through purchase. It represents the result of a transacted purchase line item. &#8203; The diagram below illustrates assets and how they are related to the rest of the <span>Modern Commerce API</span> (<span>MCAPI</span>) resources:</p>

<h4>Asset Overview</h4>

<p><span asset="4492500" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4492500]</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Every asset has a </span><strong><span><span>single catalog <span>BigID</span></span></span></strong><span>.</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>&#8203;Every asset is always associated with one <strong><span>project or invoice section </span></strong>as its <strong><span>authorization container</span></strong>.</span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span>&#8203;When purchased, the recipient project is the project first associated with this asset.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>&#8203;An asset may have <strong><span>one or many behaviors</span></strong>. An asset is a composite resource that is represented by a single base asset and multiple behaviors associated with it.</span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span>Behaviors are identified in the <span>BigCat</span><span> </span>asset instruction section.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Each behavior contains a set of closely related attributes that define a unique commercial aspect of an asset.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Behaviors include:</span></span></span></span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Ratable</span></strong></span></span></span></span>
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				<li><span><span><span><span>Indicates that this asset is a blanket container of which service usages are rated together. This is typically used in a consumption scenario where quantities of usages are unknown ahead of time.<br>
				<strong>Example:</strong> Azure Access Pass asset has this behavior. </span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Assets with this behavior are frequently called Rating Asset Direct (<span>RAD) or Rating Asset Linked (RAL</span>). </span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Access Passes will be available first to field-led customers on Field Led Azure Modern (FLAM). <span>(WD)</span>, <span>Cloud Solution Provider (CSP)</span>, and Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers will have an Access Pass created behind the scenes for them for a normalized system <span>arch</span>itecture. Customers will not be exposed to this concept and will continue using Azure Subscriptions as their billing scope.</span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Quantifiable</span></strong></span></span></span></span>
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				<li><span><span><span><span>Indicates that the asset has a known and limited quantity of licenses, products, or benefits&#8203; chosen by a customer at the time of purchase.<br>
				<strong>Example:</strong> Per-seat-based Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models like Office 365, Minecraft, and Azure Reservations have this behavior.</span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Quantity helps define the legally binding license count a customer can choose. A software publisher might choose to do a hard enforcement of their quantity (don&#39;t issue more if the quantity cap is hit), or soft enforcement of their quantity (<span>true-up for an over-used portion</span>). The former is currently being supported in the system, while the latter is in the roadmap to build.</span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Quantity can accumulate through multiple purchases.</span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Term-Based (Renewable)</span></strong></span></span></span></span>
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				<li><span><span><span><span>&#8203;Indicates whether the asset has a limited duration for its license, benefit, or product.<br>
				<strong>Example:</strong> Azure Reservations have this behavior because they can be a 1-year or 3-year offer.</span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Some products allow customers to turn on auto-renew to extend the term, hence this is the attribute where &quot;auto-renew&quot; can be toggled on or off. The <em>IsRenewable</em> flag configured in the catalog tells the system whether the product can be renewed or not.<br>
				<strong>Example:</strong> Office 365 would allow AutoRenew, while Azure Reserved Instance would not. </span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Future Billing </span></strong></span></span></span></span>
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				<li><span><span><span><span>Stores a set of settings (such as BillingGroup) that systems can use to charge a customer&#39;s renewal fee or consumption overage fee.<br>
				<strong>Example:</strong> Access Pass (Azure Access Pass) and SaaS subscription offers will have Future Billing behavior on it.</span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span>Usage </span></strong></span></span></span></span>
			<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
				<li><span><span><span><span>This indicates this asset has a 1-to-1 mapping to an Azure Subscription. This is a behavior only used for connecting Azure consumption with the Rating asset.</span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>

</ul>

<h3><strong><span><span><a id="Asset Usage Accrual" name="Asset Usage Accrual"></a>Asset Usage Accrual</span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span>Usage assets connect Access Passes (commerce) with AzureSubs (deployment or management).</span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>What is Azure Access Pass? &#8203;</span></span></strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li><span>Some parts of it are very similar to legacy AzureSubs:</span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>The customer gets rated and billed under each Access Pass.</span></li>
		<li><span>The customer can choose what service they want to use based on their elastic needs.</span></li>
		<li><span>The customer only pays after usages. (They can pre-buy benefits like Reserved Instance.)</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>However, it offers richer functionality than AzureSubs:</span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>AzureSubs can be kept as a deployment and management container.</span></li>
		<li><span>Multiple AzureSubs can be billed against a single Access Pass.</span></li>
		<li><span>Usages can be accrued cross AzureSubs for better pricing benefits (like graduated pricing).</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span lang="EN">There can be multiple types of Access Pass, such as Dev/Test, Standard, and Fairfax. Typically, each Billing Account has one Dev/Test and one Standard Access Pass.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Access Pass is only visible to Partner Led CSPs. </span></p>

<h4><strong><span><span>How Does Usage Get Accrued to an Access Pass?</span></span></strong><span><span> &#8203;</span></span></h4>

<p><span><span>Each AzureSub will have a corresponding usage asset created. Each usage asset remembers the AzureSubscription ID it is associated with. When usages flow into the MCAPI system, it then knows which usage asset gets affected and hence the Access Pass to use for rating. &#8203;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&#8203;<span lang="EN">A single Access Pass can have one or more usage assets from the platform perspective. An Azure Subscription (Usage Asset) is only related to one Azure Access Pass.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><a id="Asset Life Cycle" name="Asset Life Cycle"></a>Asset Life Cycle</span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span><span><span>An asset has its own life cycle driven by many actors in the system.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Purchase</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Creates a new asset.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Recurrence Processor</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Auto expires term-based assets at their end-of-life cycle.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Renew assets where auto-renew is turned on.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Dunning</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Mark asset as delinquent and activated as part of the cash collection process. Service provider decides actions to take against these</span></span><span><span> signals.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Cancel and Return<br>
	Note: Can be driven by Customer Service and Support (CSS), Operations, or the customer.</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Deletes an asset.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Asset Self-cleanup</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Abandon an asset that shouldn&rsquo;t be created &ndash; system error, rollback, etc.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>The following is an asset life cycle diagram with associated active drivers:</span></span></span></p>

<h4><strong><span>Asset Delegation&#8203;</span></strong></h4>

<p><strong>Asset Management Capability Can Be Delegated, but the Bill Is Still Aggregated</strong></p>

<p><span><span>Asset owners can choose to delegate other parts of the organization to manage their assets, but the owner still pays for all bills associated with the assets. This action is called <em>delegation</em>. Delegation results in an additional asset that is linked with the original asset, to represent this relationship. The original asset is usually referred to as the <em>direct asset</em>, and the delegated asset is usually referred to as the <em>delegated asset</em> or the <em>linked asset</em>.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Entitlement Asset Delegation</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span>It is usually easier to start with an <em>entitlement asset</em>. These are assets that the user knows the quantity to buy ahead of time, in contrast to the usage model used for Azure Pay-As-You-Go offerings.</span></p>

<p><span><span>The following diagram illustrates an example where 1,000 Office 365 assets (seats) get purchased, and 200 of those assets get delegated to User 2 for Project 2. As a result, all charges for the 1,000 seats will be charged against Asset 1, with the billing group specified on Asset 1, but user 2 can manage their delegated 200 seats.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: This is a future scenario to be turned on End-to-End (E2E) but listed here for illustration and concept building.</span></span></p>

<h3><strong><span><span><a id="Asset Transfer" name="Asset Transfer"></a>Asset Transfer</span></span></strong></h3>

<p><span>The Asset Transfer operation gives customers the ability to:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Transfer the right to manage a product&#8203;.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Transfer the financial responsibility to own a product&#8203;.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Transfer a partial quantity of a purchased product. </span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span>Coming soon. This is not in scope for the 2/15/2019 release.</span></span></span></li>
	</ul>

<p><span><span>Access Pass delegation <span>is <span>very similar</span></span></span></span><span><span>. However, instead of delegating a fixed set of entitlements, the owner allows other users to set up Azure Subscriptions and let usages be pumped and billed against an original Access Pass asset:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>&#8203;<span>RAD (Rating Asset Direct) is similar to Access Pass Direct. The Access Pass was directly purchased and has a billing group with it.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>RAL (Rating Asset Linked) is similar to Access Pass Linked or Delegated. The Access Pass was created by delegation steps.</span></span></span></span></li>
