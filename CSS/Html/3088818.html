<div class="indent"><span>If a customer has a past due balance when they update their account with a new credit card, the past due balance will be charged to the new card. If the spending limit on the new card is not sufficient to settle the past due balance or if another problem occurs with the new card, the card is added, but not associated with the subscription in the billing system. The old credit card will continue to be billed and the customer will continue to receive credit card declined emails. The sequence of events would be: </span></div>

<div class="indent">
<div class="indent"><span>a. Customer receives a decline email on their old credit card.</span></div>
</div>

<div class="indent">
<div class="indent"><span>b. Customer updates their subscription with a new credit card.</span></div>

<div class="indent">

<div class="indent">
<div class="indent"><span>ii. Get the date and time from the customer when the new credit card was added. </span></div>

<div class="indent">
<div class="indent"><span>iii. Check <span class="text-base">Charge Attempts</span> in CMAT for any transactions that were declined. Declined transactions will show as <span class="text-base">Failed </span>in the <span class="text-base">Status </span>column. </span></div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span><span>Support should explain to customers that their&nbsp;bank may require them a multi-factor authentication on purchases, changing&nbsp;payment instrument (credit/debit card), increasing&nbsp;license count, upgrading/downgrading, etc. If customer&#39;s bank requires multi-factor authentication, customers&nbsp;will be prompted to enter a code during the process. This code will be sent to their&nbsp;personal account or device (usually mobile phone number or email address) that is associated to their bank. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>If receives inquiries about what is the multi-factor authentication or PSD2, below information will be a reference to approach this kind of questions.</strong><br>
<span><span><span><span><span>*PSD2 (Payment Services Directive 2) is a new regulation that will be in effect in September 14, 2019 in Europe (31 European countries). The goal of the regulation is to decrease fraud for online transactions, which can be think of continuation of the chip card mandate in Europe (for in store transactions) to online world. The regulation mainly mandates the issuing banks in Europe to provide the technology for the customers to provide MFA (multi-factor authentication). Merchants are strongly recommended to integrate with the banks MFA technology, otherwise issuing banks will start declining transactions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>If customers have any concerns or questions about the MFA</strong>,<strong> </strong>advise them to contact their issuing bank. When working on an active case, support&nbsp;needs to add &lsquo;<strong>#PSD2#&rsquo; </strong>tag<strong> </strong>to the <em>Issue Description</em> area on <em>Summary</em> tab in Rave. And support&nbsp;can explain to customers that:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft does not verify multi-factor Authentication.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t have the capability to trigger or resend the code</span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The phone number/email is registered with the bank and Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t have visibility to which account the code is sent to.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t have the capability to change or update the email or phone number registered with the bank.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Potentially there are several reasons for this error message: </span></span></span></span></span></p>
