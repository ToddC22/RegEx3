<h3><span><a id="4" name="4"></a>4. How do we do this?</span></h3>

<h4><span><a class="ms-asset-internalBookmark" id="4" title="4"></a></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 Fortification</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>This is done either via ASD&rsquo;s fortify option, or by asking the customer to send/receive an email from the email address associated with their Bing Places account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>ASD email note</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: Customers who contact support via email in ASD must complete a web-form, where they are asked to enter a <strong>Preferred Contact Email</strong> and their <strong>Bing Places Account Email</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Both are free-entry text boxes, meaning that the customer can enter anything they like. The ASD ticket is generated based on the preferred option, but we do not know for sure that the customer is the owner of these addresses. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Always fortify the email associated to the Bing Places account the customer wishes to discuss, no matter what email address the ticket is created with in ASD.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><a id="4.2" name="4.2"></a>4.2 Verification </span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>This<strong> </strong>can<strong>&nbsp;</strong>be done several ways, depending on whether the listing is being&nbsp;<strong>claimed</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>added</strong>. (You can tell if a listing is claimed, either by the&nbsp;<strong>Single-Claim</strong>&nbsp;status in the Admin dashboard, or simply by searching to see if the location name and address exists on Bing Local Listings already.)</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Google Sync Callout</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: If an advertiser wants to create/verify listings which are already verified in Google My Business, they can use a </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB">Google My Business Account Sync</span> <span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>to automatically sync and verify these listings in Bing Places. See KB </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4515875" managed-link="" target="_blank">4515875 Process: Bing Places: Google My Business Account Sync</a> for more information.</span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>This is the recommended option to mirror GMB listings quickly and easily within Bing Places. </span></span></span>&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For claimed listings:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The advertiser has access to an email address which matches the company&rsquo;s domain, and can complete the ASD fortification process. Be especially aware of any attempts to use similar domain names in a hostile attempt to access data. For example, using an email of &quot;microsof.com&rdquo; to attempt access to a &ldquo;microsoft.com&rdquo; website listing (known as masking).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The advertiser&rsquo;s website clearly calls out their email address as a recognised contact for the business, and you can successfully fortify this email address. (Can be accepted even if the email address is generic.)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Call the business phone number displayed on the published YPID entity to confirm the business exists, and check they are aware of the attempt to claim their listing through Bing Places. <strong>Important</strong>: Do not share personal data relating to the claim.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Call the number listed on the website, and confirm that the busines exists and that they are expecting someone to manage their listing on Bing Places.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For added listings:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The following options <strong>can only be used if the customer has a storefront that can be clearly seen via Google Streetview </strong>or<strong> Bing Streetside</strong> at the business location.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The advertiser has access to an email address which matches the company&rsquo;s domain, and can complete the ASD fortification process. Be especially aware of any attempts to use similar domain names in a hostile attempt to access data, for example, using an email of &rdquo;microsof.com&rdquo; to attempt access to a &rdquo;microsoft.com&rdquo; website listing (known as masking).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The advertiser&rsquo;s website clearly calls out their email address as a recognised contact for the business, and you can successfully fortify this email address. (Can be accepted even if the email address is generic.)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Call the number listed on the website, and confirm that the busines exists and that they are expecting someone to manage their listing on Bing Places.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the above options cannot be applied:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The customer will need to use postal PIN verification. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the PIN has been received, but is not being recognised, you can ask the customer to provide a scanned copy of the PIN verification notice.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If Resend Postal PIN fails:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a customer has attempted to use the Resend PIN feature, and this has failed, <strong>then in this scenario only</strong> you can attempt to locate a published listing for the customer on <strong>Google My Business</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If you are successful, you can use the verification options listed above for <strong>Added listings</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the customer is unable to pass using any of these methods, advise them that we will be unable to assist.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Ticket handling:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a customer is reporting a missing PIN and this is within the usual <strong>twelve days maximum SLA</strong> for postal delivery (and the above admin verify steps are not applicable), you can set postal PIN delivery expectations and close the ticket.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a customer is reporting a missing PIN and they are outside of SLA, you should use the <strong>Resend PIN</strong> function (if the above admin verify steps cannot be supplied) and <strong>keep your ticket open</strong> to confirm PIN was received.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Allow <strong>five business days</strong> for the Resend PIN delivery time, before taking further action. No need to wait the standard twelve business days in this scenario.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="5" name="5"></a>5. FAQ</h3>

<p><a class="ms-asset-internalBookmark" id="5" title="5"></a><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Why are you forcing people to prove their physical location/why have you changed your verification process? I rely on online/email verification to speed up the process!&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>I understand you&rsquo;d like to verify your business as quickly as possible to get your listings published on Bing. As part of our commitment to listing accuracy and integrity, we&rsquo;re making sure that business locations are valid entities, and that the customers owning these businesses are expecting to be managed in our platform. We do this by verifying a location exists, and that the owner of that business location agrees to their listing being claimed and managed in our product.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Can we mention that we are using Google Streetview to customers?</strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>No &ndash; this is an internal process. If you are unable to locate the customer via Streetview or Bing Streetside, say that we have been attempting to confirm their physical location but we have been unable to do so. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How will listings synced with GMB show up in the Bing Places UI?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a listing is already verified in GMB, it will be given <strong>Verified</strong> status by default in Bing Places. If the listing is not verified, it will show as <strong>Single-Add</strong>.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: If a customer has no website for their business and is having trouble receiving their postal PIN, how can we verify them as the business owner?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Here are a few things that can be done:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Ask the customer to trigger postal re-verification and wait five business days for delivery.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For <strong>claimed listings </strong>only: Check Google Streetview (or Bing Streetside) to verify that the business exists in the location claimed. If so, call the number of the published YPID to confirm the business exists and the user you&rsquo;re talking to operates from this address.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If these options have been tried (or are not applicable) escalate to Global Support for missing postal PIN issues.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How can I fortify the user if they are unable to access their Bing Places email?</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the user&#39;s Bing Places login is the same as their Microsoft account, direct the customer to the standard Microsoft account Help Pages online for help resetting their username/password.<br>
<br>
If the user&#39;s Bing Places login is different from their Microsoft account, (for example, they use david@gmail.com to sign in, and cannot access their Gmail account) then we can do one of the following:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For <strong>Claimed </strong>or<strong> Verified</strong> listings only: Call the phone number on the customer&#39;s published YPID listing, and fortify via phone that we&#39;re speaking to the account user.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the user is an agency/SEO, and they are unable to fortify due to differences between their Microsoft account and Bing Places login email, you can fortify using the following method:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Ask the agency for the email they use to access Bing Places.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Use the <strong>Sign-In As</strong> feature to log in to their account, and then under the <strong>Agency Information</strong> section select <strong>Edit</strong> to see the agency&#39;s email and phone number.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Advise the customer that we can use this email to fortify instead, or we can offer to call on the number listed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If agency/SEO is using a client&#39;s email, and does not have an agency account, we can ask them to sign into Bing Places and edit the information within the <strong>Preferences</strong> section of the account, so that either their preferred phone or email is displayed. We can then use this information to call/email and complete the fortification process, and change it back to the client&#39;s data after fortification has been completed.<br>
<br>
<strong>Note: </strong>If the agency/SEO requires help with listings that haven&#39;t yet been verified by their client, <strong>we will still need to go through the usual verification process</strong> before we can help the agency edit or admin-verify listings on behalf of that client.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
