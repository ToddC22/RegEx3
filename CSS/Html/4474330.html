<h3><strong><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>Azure Cost Management (ACM) helps Enterprises, Cloud Partners and other Azure customers effectively plan and control their cloud cost. ACM also helps analyze anomalies spent in the cloud as well as optimize cloud spending.</p>

<p>This TSG provides guidance on how to assist customers who contact support with questions/issues related to ACM.</p>

<p>Azure Cost Management is available for the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG)</strong>. More information available <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-cost-management-now-generally-available-for-pay-as-you-go-customers/">here</a>.</li>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Power BI App:</strong> EA customers (only) can use the Power BI App to manage their spend cost. More information <span>available</span> <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/costmgmt/ACMinsights" managed-link="" target="_blank">here. </a>To install the App click <a href="https://aka.ms/costmgmt/ACMApp" managed-link="" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>For Cloudyn related cases, follow the process outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/4050787" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 4050787</a>.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Always check to see if the case is related to billing or ACM by suggesting that the customer share a screenshot using the&nbsp;&lsquo;Ctrl +Alt +D&rsquo; keys.

<ul>
	<li>ACM related cases must be vetted by a Technical Advisor (TA) or for the suppliers by one of the supplier Team Leads (TLs). Once vetted, your<strong> </strong>TA/TL will leverage the ACM Swarming Channels on Teams as outlined in the <a bookmark-id="Engagement and Escalation Path" href="#Engagement and Escalation Path" managed-link="">Engagement and Escalation Path</a> section of this TGS.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>ACM cases are handled by ASMS. For escalation needs leverage the dedicated ACM Swarming Channels in Teams called out below.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><a id="ChangeofChannelPartner" name="ChangeofChannelPartner"></a>Change of Channel Partner (COCP)</strong></h4>

<p>Partners markup the prices of services and features they provide differently from one another. Therefore, Azure blocks the customer view of costs until the next annual term. This prevents indirect customers from seeing differences in price markups if they change partners.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Example</strong>: It appears to an indirect customer that their term starts April 1. If the COCP happened in January, we would have dropped their cost view Jan &ndash; Mar.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>TAGS</strong></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li>Resource group tags are not supported and only supports resource tags.</li>
	<li>Resource tags are applied as usage is emitted from each service and aren&#39;t available retroactively to historical usage. If they don&#39;t show up when the usage shows up, it&#39;s an issue with the service.</li>
	<li>Each service is responsible for sending tags with usage. If it doesn&#39;t show up with the usage, the service didn&#39;t send it. How and when the service sends usage will impact what you see.</li>
	<li>This is the list of Tag support for Azure resources in ARM <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/tag-support" managed-link="" target="_blank" title="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/tag-support">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/tag-support</a>.</li>
	<li>Classic resources do not support Resource Group and/or Tags. See <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/4456278" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 4456278</a>.</li>
	<li>Tags are case insensitive. This may cause tags entered with capital letters to be displayed in all lowercase in the <strong>Cost Analysis </strong>section of the portal. See <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-name-rules" managed-link="" target="_blank">Resource Naming Restrictions</a> for more information on the format of tag and resource names.</li>
	<li>Tags updated in the portal take 24 to 48 hours to be applied. Since the published data is for the previous day&rsquo;s usage, these changes will not appear in the usage report for two days.</li>
	<li>When grouping costs by a specific attribute, the top 10 cost contributors are shown from highest to lowest. If there are more than 10 cost contributors, the top nine are shown plus the Others group, which represents all remaining groups combined.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>When grouping by tags, an Untagged group appears for cost contributors that don&#39;t have a tag key applied.&nbsp;Advise the customer to switch to the table view and change granularity to None to see all values ranked from highest to lowest cost.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>If a resource was moved from one resource group to other, the tag will not gather the billing information before the movement.</li>
	<li>If a resource was added to a tag, the previous cost of this resource will not appear in the tag. The cost is effective only after the movement date.</li>
	<li>If a tag was &quot;recently&quot; created, it will not show the billing information previously to its creation date.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><a id="TroubleshootEnterpriseCostViews" name="TroubleshootEnterpriseCostViews"></a>Troubleshoot Enterprise Cost Views</strong></h4>

<p>The customer is seeing the message Unauthorized, or <em>&quot;</em>Cost views are disabled in your enrollment&quot; when looking for cost information.</p>

<p><span asset="4494285" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4494285]</span></p>

<p>Inform the customer that this may occur for one of the following reasons:</p>

<ol>
	<li>You&rsquo;ve bought Azure through an enterprise partner, and the partner didn&#39;t release pricing yet. Contact your partner to update the pricing setting within the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://ea.azure.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Enterprise portal</a>.</li>
	<li>If you&rsquo;re an EA Direct customer, there are a couple of possibilities:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>You&#39;re an Account Owner, and your Enrollment Administrator disabled the <strong>AO view charges</strong> setting.</li>
		<li>You&#39;re a Department Administrator, and your Enrollment Administrator disabled the <strong>DA view charges </strong>setting.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Contact your Enrollment Administrator to get access. The Enrollment Admin can update the settings in the <a href="https://ea.azure.com/manage/enrollment" managed-link="" target="_blank">Enterprise portal</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Pay-As-You-Go Customer Experience</strong></p>

<p>As of 3/4/2020, customers on the Pay As you Go Subscriptions (3P) who purchase Spot receive a separate invoice for their Spot Charges as Spot is a Modern product and will be rated and invoiced in the modern systems by calendar month.</p>

<p>These customers have the following experience in Azure Cost Management:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Charges accrued against Spot VMs appear under the Invoices (Marketplace and Spot) view in the date picker, not under Invoices (Azure), because charges against Spot VMs are invoiced by calendar month and not by billing period.<br>
	<span asset="4550575" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4550575]</span></li>
	<li>Spot charges are also available available if any of the options under Relative dates or Calendar months are selected, since these options are not Invoice specific.</li>
	<li>For supported currencies, Spot charges are displayed in the Local or Billing currency.</li>
	<li>For unsupported currencies, Spot charges are only displayed in USD.<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> other Azure consumption charges are still displayed in Billing Currency.</li>
	<li>The Usage Details download file is structured in the same way: Spot charges appear in the Marketplace services file.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Cost Allocation&nbsp;</strong></h4>

<p><span><span>Cost Allocation&nbsp;is a feature that allows Billing Account Owners or Enrollment Administrators in charge of payments to redirect the costs of shared services back out to internal departments in their organization at the Subscription, Resource Group or tag level. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This feature is s is managed at the ARM level, so CST will not&nbsp;show any data around this. Should you receive a case related to this feature, share the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://aka.ms/allocationdocs" managed-link="" target="_blank">public facing document</a>&nbsp;with the customer. If the customer needs further assistance, leverage the ACM Swarming Channel: <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a9bbf8fdc0a7d405da694e92e040f37e6%40thread.skype/ACM%2520Cost%2520Allocation?groupId=5a6d9cfa-6727-4508-b06f-5e444496bf2e&amp;tenantId=72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47" managed-link="" target="_blank">ACM Cost Allocation</a>&nbsp;for additional guidance.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Troubleshooting ACM Scenarios</strong></p>

<p>Please refer to <a href="https://sharepoint/sites/fastrack/_layouts/15/WopiFrame.aspx?sourcedoc=%7b58d5979a-c891-4221-acc5-9a3ab16ed11c%7d&amp;action=default" managed-link="">this document</a> which includes best practices and troubleshooting steps related to various ACM scenarios.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="Access/PermissionIssue" name="Access/PermissionIssue"></a>Access/Permission Issue</strong></h4>

<p>Customer reports that they logged into the Cost Management blade in Azure and they receive a permission error. In these instances, do the following:</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;If you are unable to determine if the issue is related to billing or ACM, suggest to the customer that they share a screenshot with a combination of &lsquo;Ctrl +Alt +D&rsquo; keys.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ask the customer to provide the following:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>A full-page screenshot (including the URL) of the error received.</li>
		<li>A screenshot of their rolesets in RBAC.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Based on the screenshot, determine if the customer is using the &nbsp;App.cloudyn.com, Azure.cloudyn.com, or <a href="https://ms.portal.azure.com">https://ms.portal.azure.com</a> URL.
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>If the customer is using a <strong>cloudyn</strong> URL, transfer the task to the <strong>Cloudyn Legacy&nbsp;Queue</strong>. For detailed steps follow the guidance outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/4050787" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 4050787</a>.<br>
		<strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;SLA must first be met, before the case can be transferred.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>If the customer is using the <strong>portal.azure</strong> URL, proceed with step 3.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Check the blade that the customer is logged into and compare it to the image below. Depending on which section the customer is using, assist the customer as appropriate:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>Azure Cost Management- Proceed to step 4</li>
		<li>EA Subscription Billing- Follow the normal troubleshooting process.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>MOSP Subscription Billing - Follow the normal troubleshooting process. &nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Check the customer&rsquo;s configuration.
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><strong>EA </strong><strong>or Web Direct (WD) customer&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; Provide the following troubleshooting tutorial link to the customer:&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/assign-access-acm-data" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/assign-access-acm-data</a>.&nbsp;</li>
		<li><strong>Indirect EA customer</strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Check if markup was published. For more details, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658507" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2658507</a> (EA Differences in Supporting Indirect EA Customers).
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>
			<p><span>In the EA portal, markup will be shown as <em>Published </em>throughout the enrollment period. This feature is enabled when markup is published for the first time by the partner. The partner must republish the markup every annual term. </span><span>To validate that markup is published for the existing term, ask the customer if they can see the <em>Usage Summary</em> in the EA portal or <em>Usage </em>in <em>Usage Report</em> in the EA portal. If these are missing, engage the EA team to confirm that markup is enabled for the current enrollment.&nbsp;</span></p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>CSP </strong><strong>customer</strong> &ndash; Inform the customer that ACM supports only CSP subscriptions who have onboarded their customers to the Modern Customer Agreement.</li>
		<li>More information about ACM for Partners can be found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/get-started-partners" managed-link="" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>

	<li>If the customer returns with additional questions after providing the troubleshooting steps,&nbsp;engage your TA by following the Engagement and Escalation Path section below.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>Cost Discrepancy Between ACM and EA Usage</strong></h4>

<p>Enrollment costs are categorized in the EA portal as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>Commitment Usage</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>Service Overage</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>Charges Billed Separately</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>Azure Marketplace</span></span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>The total cost of these 4 categories appears as the total cost in ACM. In any given case, be sure to specify which category of cost the customer is referring to.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: In the EA Portal, <em>Purchase</em> can be listed as a service and is not associated with a subscription, while in ACM it can be associated with a subscription.</p>

<p><span><span>There is no difference in cost for Indirect EA on ACM. ACM Cost/Usage information is directly related to the billing data which is available to the customer under <em>Usage Report</em> in the EA portal. ASMS can verify the usage and cost information using CMAT, the EA Portal, Commerce Support Tool (CST), or Aggregated Usage.</span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope">COST ANALYSIS does not display CONSUMED QUANTITY or USAGE data as Query API does not support it yet. Engineering have plans to support it but no ETA as of June 2020.</p>

<h4><strong>Cost Discrepancy Between ACM and Invoice for Non-EA Subscriptions</strong></h4>

<p><span><span>In order to compare ACM with an invoice, customers should filter by the invoice number of the billing period, or choose one of the invoice options in the date picker. Filtering by a custom date range is not sufficient because costs for the same date can be divided between different invoices.</span></span></p>

<p>If a customer reports cost/usage discrepancies in the Azure Cost Management blade or missing data, based on the knowledge of their prior consumption or comparison of the EA portal do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Confirm that the customer is looking at the <strong>ACM</strong> owned blade.</li>
	<li>Ask the customer to provide the following if the details were not already submitted via the SR:&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>A full-page screenshot (including the URL) of the error received in the portal.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>If the customer is using a <strong>cloudyn</strong> URL, transfer the Task&nbsp;to the <strong>Cloudyn Legacy&nbsp;Queue</strong>.</li>
			<li>If the customer is using the <strong>portal.azure</strong> URL, proceed with the next step.</li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>PowerBI is not available for &nbsp;PayG customers, as they are on legacy subscriptions and do not have a Microsoft Customer Agreement.

<h4><strong><a id="Budget/Consumption API issues" name="Budget/Consumption API issues"></a>Budget/Consumption API issues</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>In order to create a budget, the customer needs to have access to the cost data (i.e. AO/DA views should be enables and markup should be published). See Asset Unavailable section in this TSG.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Currently, it&rsquo;s not possible to create budget for subscriptions with little or no usage (except internal offers). This also means that subscriptions with no usage are not available in budget filters in UI.</span></span></span><br>
	<span><span><span>&nbsp;As a workaround customer can create budget via API where they can directly place subscription GUID into filtering</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Resource groups with little or no usage are not shown in budget filters</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Budget names are only unique within a scope</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>When an account / subscription / resource group is deleted the corresponding budget is not deleted automatically. The customer will need to delete it manually.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can set a budget alert to any email account, including distribution lists, shared mail accounts and personal addresses.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>In case subscription offer type changes (and, hence, historical data is not available) query and budgets will have data only from the day of transfer and budget alerts would be based on new data only</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>In case of EA transfer, budgets created on subscription and bellow scopes should not be affected. Budgets created on higher levels should be recreated by customer (for example, budgets on a billing account level).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The language of the enrollment COUNTRY impacts the language of alerts sent and currently we are tracking this as an enhancement request that we need to develop. We currently don&#39;t support changing this as it is not possible to select/Change the language of the budget email alerts. The system takes the language from the Locale set on the Azure account/EA account.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Budgets only evaluated in the billing currency</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>In case budget currency is not matching the chosen currency, they would be hidden from UI. In other words, if customer has budget in currency other than USD, those budgets would be hidden when he switches to &ldquo;Only USD&rdquo; view</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Budget uses &ldquo;Evaluated&rdquo; spend which happens every 12 hours (updated on July 2020) while Cost Analysis calls queries directly to get current cost, hence there can be a cost discrepancy between budget evaluated cost and actual spend. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li>Common Schema Alert is not currently supported with actions groups. The customer will need to set up an action group without common schema in order to receive budget alerts.</li>
	<li>Push Notifications on IOS. Azure Mobile does not currently support budget alert push notifications. We do not have explicit support for this type, though should they onboard to the unified schema pipeline, our app would automatically display them (as we support all unified schema independently of type of alert they represent).</li>
	<li>Annual Budget would only send a notification once per year. If the Budget threshold is reduced, ACM will not send any notification until the next billing period.</li>
	<li>ACM features will not work when Azure offer is upgraded to an offer not supported in ACM.</li>
	<li>Email alert notifications are sent from azure-noreply@microsoft.com. Verify with the customer that the address is not blocked by spam filters before escalating.</li>
	<li>In order to disable alerts to a specific recipient, the user need to do the following:
	<ol>
		<li>Navigate to the Budget blade.</li>
		<li>Select the Budget that is generating the alerts and click <strong>edit. </strong></li>
		<li>Follow the wizard, where it will then allow you to delete users who should no longer receive alerts.&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If the customer needs additional assitance do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ask customer to provide the following details for the escalation purposes:
	<ul>
		<li>ARM template in case budget is created via ARM</li>
		<li>Network trace of Budget blade</li>

<p><strong><a id="EAstatusandavailablilityinACM" name="EAstatusandavailablilityinACM"></a>EA status and availablility in ACM</strong></p>

<p><strong>Extended </strong>&ndash; At the end of the agreement date, enrollments are opted into indefinite Extended Term by default. The enrollment status changes from <strong>Active</strong> to <strong>Extended</strong>. This enables EA customers to use Azure indefinitely at the end of their enterprise agreement. Usage is charged as overages and customers continue to be invoiced. Usage details need to be shown on the EA portal for these customers. If a customer opts out of the extended term once they reach their end date, the status becomes <strong>Expired</strong>.<br>
<br>
<strong>Expired Status</strong> &ndash; Enrollments expire and all associated services are disabled between 30 and 90 days for EA customers who opt out of the Extended Term at their enterprise agreement end date. Services are not terminated immediately during expired terms; some customers may still incur charges unless it is manually disabled by Azure Enterprise Operations (EA Ops). Customers cannot be invoiced after their term expires; therefore, all overage invoices are cancelled. The EA portal does not display usage for expired terms.<br>
<br>
<strong>Terminated</strong> &ndash; This status indicates that the agreement is cancelled on the Microsoft Service Level (MSL) side by ROC. However, the process does not contact EA Ops to also terminate the agreement in ASMS. These terminations are not completed, and backend usage is generated as subscriptions are still active. Since termination was submitted by the customer, ASMS cannot invoice them and usage after termination does not display in the EA portal.<br>
<br>
<strong>Manually Ter</strong><strong>minated</strong> &ndash; Initiated by EA Ops. Enrollment is terminated and does not generate charges. All accounts and subscriptions are inactive when terminated. Accounts or subscriptions that remain active are signs of a system bug.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em><a id="DataavailabilityinACM" name="DataavailabilityinACM"></a>Data availability in ACM</em></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>For<strong> Active</strong> and <strong>Extended</strong> status continue to return data (past and present) to the customer.</li>
	<li>For <strong>Expired</strong>, <strong>Terminated</strong>, <strong>Manually Terminated</strong>, and <strong>Transferred</strong> status return data for past dates. Queries for data after the end date will return an HTTP 400 &ldquo;bad Request&rdquo; error.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to BizOps, if enrollment expires, no usage or invoice or bill is generated and the customer cannot see data past the expiration date of enrollment.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>All mentioned names can be used in UI in case customer is trying to group by a field that has no value (eg. Resource Group. Usually this happens to purchases and marketplace. Please advise the customer to do the following:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>To group by Charge Type, check if it&#39;s a purchase.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>To group by Publisher Type, check if it&#39;s Marketplace charges.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Charts and widgets show the top nine results only. All remaining are grouped as &quot;Others&quot;. Advise the customer to switch to table view to see everything in the charts.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="Views in ACM" name="Views in ACM"></a>Views in ACM</h4>

<p><span>Customers can only share views if they have write access to the scope. Anyone can save private views.</span></p>

<h4><strong><a id="Marketplace" name="Marketplace"></a>Marketplace</strong></h4>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Marketplace is now supported in ACM. Ask customer to group by Publisher Type to see Marketplace</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Reservation purchases are only available for Enterprise Agreement (EA) and Microsoft Customer Agreement accounts at this time. In order to see them, customer should switch to &ldquo;Actual&rdquo; cost and use filter Charge Type</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>For Unused reservations customer should switch to &ldquo;Amortized&rdquo; cost and use filter Charge Type.</span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span>RI renewal alerts are sent to EA notification contacts today.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span><span><span><span>Forecast</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Currently, linear model is used for forecast. Forecast takes a week to adjust the projections based on the changes made by the customer. The model is not reactive to immediate changes.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Additionally, the model also does not account for purchase and RI discounts separately, currently it considers usage, purchase as one cost. if you have one off purchase in the past and lower usage every subsequent days the model believes that the usage is on a downward trend and will go to 0 on some days, the model takes up to a month to adjust to this one time high usage/purchase before it returns to normal trend.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Forecast can be unavailable in case there is not enough historical data, or in case EA number changed recently.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span>Azure Advisor</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>EA customers get recommendations based on their negotiated on-demand rates</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The savings numbers in advisor factors in the utilization pattern that the user had over last 30 days. If at any time the utilization of RI would have been less than 100%, then it reduces the saving%. In the RI purchase UI, the number is based on the assumption that utilization will be 100, we don&rsquo;t consider the past trend.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>RI recommendations data have cost savings in Customer pricing currency</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span>Management Groups</span></span></span></span></h4>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Management Groups for MCA accounts are not supported in Cost Analysis (this includes also Partner and end customer modern subscriptions)</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Exports for Management Groups currently support only EA subscriptions</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Before adding AWS connector, Management Group with subscription that would be used for billing should be created</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span><span><span><span>Refunds</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Currently, only RI refunds are shown in Cost Analysis. The refund appears the month it was done, not the month RI was purchased.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>ACM is enabled for CSP for customers onboarded to MCA. This can be verified in CST. </span></span><span><span><span>Customer-facing info is available on <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management/get-started-partners">Get started with Azure Cost Management for partners</a>. </span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>ACM is not supported for CSP legacy offers <span><span>MS-AZR-0145P, MS-AZR-USGOV-0145P, or MS-AZR-DE-0145P (see list of supported/unsupported offers in this TSG)</span></span>. Support for Legacy CSPs is in the roadmap.</span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>For the rest of the CSP customers, ACM is available as a web app that allows tracking and management of Azure usage and costs. It is usable through the Partner Center API.

	<p><span><span><span><span>Only users with <span>Global Admin</span> and <span>Admin Agent</span> roles can manage and view costs for billing accounts, billing profiles, and customers directly in the partner&#39;s Azure tenant.</span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>In general, CSP customers can access data related to usage, billing, and commerce from the Partner center portal associated with the CSP Reseller tenant. They cannot access billing information on the Customer tenant. <span><span>Billing and account roles are managed separately from scopes used for resource management, which use RBAC. </span></span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>When CSP customers are redirected to the Azure portal, they land on the Customer tenant which is for service management and not cost management. The customer must &lsquo;Switch Directory&rsquo; on the Azure portal to <strong>CSP Reseller Tenant &gt; Cost Management + Billing &gt; Billing Account/Billing Scopes &gt; [Select the MCA]</strong>. This will show the CSP Billing details under the <em>Billing</em> blade in ACM. This blade belongs to ModernGTM, so we must engage ACE for any assistance.</span></span></p>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>For end customer, partners should enable the cost-visibility policy (see 3 steps to enable cost management)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
