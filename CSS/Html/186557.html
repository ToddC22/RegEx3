<header><h1>Terminal Server Commands: SHUTDOWN</h1></header><div class='kb-summary-section section'>SHUTDOWN allows an administrator to shut down the application server in a controlled manner. No programs can be executed after shutdown is started. You can shut down the server safely, or you may decide to reboot the server. The session of the user who initiated the shutdown is still active, but all information is read-only.<br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Syntax</h3>shutdown [wait_time] [/server:servername] [/reboot] [/powerdown] [/delay:delay_time] [/v] [/?]<br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Parameters</h3>wait_time<br><div class='indent'>   Specifies the amount of time in seconds you must wait after notifying connected users before logging off all user sessions.<br></div>/server:servername<br><div class='indent'>   Specifies the Terminal Server to shut down.

Shutdown waits a specified interval (the default interval is 60 seconds) before resetting all sessions and logging off all users. Sessions that have applications with open files will prompt the user to save the files. After initiating the logoff command, shutdown waits a specified interval (the default interval is 30 seconds; set by /delay) before terminating all processes.<br><br><br>Shutdown does not reboot the application server unless the /reboot option is specified. The Shutdown Computer option in the Security dialog box does not notify users before terminating user sessions and is not recommended.<br></div><div class='kb-textlegacy-section section'>Author: cliftonh (1998-06-01T14:30:00) Edit Reviewer: cathyan (1998-06-22T15:47:00) Tech Reviewer: willgloy (1998-06-22T15:47:00)<br></div>
