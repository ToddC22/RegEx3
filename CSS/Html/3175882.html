<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a customer contacts you to ask that this information be changed, note their BPID information and the desired changes, and escalate to Global Support for assistance.

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Before escalating Bing Places issues to Global Support, ensure the following steps have all been taken:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Help the customer <strong>claim the listing</strong>, make the changes they want, and allow one standard publish cycle to complete <strong>before </strong>escalating to Global Support.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: Although some markets benefit from super-fast publish&nbsp;(SFP) for certain attributes, you should still allow changes to take a full standard cycle publish to complete, as it is known that SFP will not always be successful.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Confirm the BPID is published</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> (see KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3138298" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-US">3138298 Process: Bing Places: &#8203;Publishing Cycle</span></a>).

<p class="indent-2"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the user is not blacklisted, but you still have reason to believe they are a scammer, escalate to Global Support and ask them to conduct an investigation into whether the customer should be blacklisted.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check that you <strong>are not escalating to have a Temporarily Closed entity marked as Open/Closed. </strong>The <strong>Temporarily Open/Closed</strong> field is sent to the YPID via a different feed&nbsp;and cannot be corrected by Global Support. Customers should claim, update, and allow the standard publish cycle to run. If the correction hasn&rsquo;t taken effect after this time, you can raise to Global Support as a bug request. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the issue cannot be resolved using these steps, <strong>escalate to Global Support</strong> for assistance.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Important</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: Do not request Global Support take specific actions on a listing.

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>In your escalation notes state:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>When correcting data discrepancies, as a best practice we should always advise customers to update their website and third-party feeds to support the changes in Bing Places (especially Yelp, which is one of our major listing providers).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>After escalating, you may find that the Tier 2 owner will require a screen recording of the customer&rsquo;s repro-steps and the error they&rsquo;re encountering, in order to provide further assistance.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If an escalation owner asks for a screen recording, ask the customer to use the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/22878" managed-link="" target="_blank">Record steps to reproduce a problem</a> help guidance to capture a recording of the error they are facing, and share this with you.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>To make it easier to download and escalate customer listings in bulk, the Bing Places Admin UI has the option to <strong>Get User Businesses</strong>. You can download this using the following process:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 Overmatching/Undermatching</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Customers may complain about duplicate listings on Bing. These are usually the result of overmatching or undermatching occurring on Bing: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Overmatching</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: When listings which should be discrete and separate are incorrectly combined into a single listing.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Undermatching</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: When listings that should be combined are instead listed as separate entities or listings. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>CSS will usually escalate these cases to Global Support, who may choose either to merge, unmerge, apply a correction, or leave as-is, depending on whether the duplication is by-design or not. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>CSS will need to convey the outcome of these escalations to the customer. (If there is uncertainty about a proposed solution, raise this with your SME/TA for review.) </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="4.2" name="4.2"></a>4.2 Distinguishing entities</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The following fundamental principles govern all Bing Places conflation decisions when matching candidates and determining whether an escalation is required: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>An <strong>Entity</strong> is identified by its <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Address</strong>. Candidates match if the name and address refer to the same entity as the target. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Although there may be slight differences in candidates due to incompleteness, additional noise words, and formatting, if the name and address refer to the same business and location, then they are the same entity. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For example, the following are separate listings with small variations in names that refer to the same entity:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Listing#1:</span></span></span></strong><br>
<span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Name &ldquo;Summit Memorial Funeral&rdquo;<br>
Address: 7 Summit Ave, Summit, NJ 07901</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Listing#2:</span></span></span></strong><br>
<span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Name &ldquo;Daniel Winther, Summit Memorial&rdquo;<br>
Address: 7 Summit Ave, Summit, NJ 07901</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> This does not apply to Professional Profiles &ndash; if one of the YPID entities is for a Service Professional&rsquo;s profile, then this is considered a separate entity from a standard local listing, and should not be considered a duplicate. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the&nbsp;address, phone, and website information relate&nbsp;to one entity, but the name indicates another, then the name overrules the other attributes. Name is the most important attribute when determining whether candidates match. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Ghost or junk listings &ndash; When the name is the same, but the address is different. These can occur when: </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>One or more of the duplicates refers to an old location. In this case, the old listing entity should be tagged as closed.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The name and address have been incorrectly combined to form an entity that never existed at a location at least 100m/330ft away from a true location. (These are considered ghost or junk entities.)</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>An entity does not exist currently and there is no proof that the entity ever existed, even if there is a possibility that it did exist. (These are considered ghost entities.) </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>An entity exists at a different location, but never existed at the location of the listing that is being evaluated as a duplicate. (These are considered junk entities.) </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Duplicate listings &ndash; These occur when the name is different, but the address is the same. These can occur when: </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A business is renamed or taken over. For example,<em> </em>When Jurys Inns Heathrow Airport was renamed to Hilton Garden Inn Heathrow Airport.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1">A Professional Profile exists alongside a Clinic/Hospital listing (for example, <strong>Dr Leonard McCoy, 210 Enterprise Rd, San Francisco</strong> and <strong>Federation Hospital, 210 Enterprise Rd, San Francisco</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>In this </span></span></span></span></span>scenario, the candidates are considered separate entities and cannot be merged (the name overrides all other attributes, creating a separate entity.)&nbsp;Advise the customer to mark the old entity as closed. &nbsp;<span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<ol start="5">
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Entities that are contained within a larger entity, whether physically or virtually, are not automatically considered a match:</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Physical containment</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> is defined as occupying a subset of space within a larger entity, such as a single building or set of nearby buildings that form part of a larger campus/park. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Examples of physically contained candidates that we would consider as separate entities would be: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul class="indent-2">
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Separate stores in a shopping mall.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Separate restaurants inside a Store.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Specialised facilities (for example, emergency rooms) or physicians inside a hospital.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A public ATM outside a bank (or other location). </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>General rule &ndash; if you can find the entity on Google Streetview, and it has a distinct access point and signage, we can consider this a valid stand-alone entity. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Virtual containment</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> is harder to define, as there are various types of virtual containment. Examples would be: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A parent company that has a subsidiary. </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A chain that has a sub-chain.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The headquarters of a chain and its branches.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>An entity that has a department (for example,<em> </em>Costco is the entity, but within this there are gas, tire centre, food court, and pharmacy).&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For department scenarios <strong>only</strong>, you can escalate to Global Support to request a merge/unmerge of candidate listings. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For all other virtual containment issues, we do not currently support linkage between parent and child candidate listings. <strong>Do not escalate for merge/unmerge requests, as these cannot be processed.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>A common example of virtual containment issues that we do not support would be car dealerships who operate from the same location, but attempt to promote themselves under their affiliated car-manufacturer names. For example,<em>&nbsp;&lsquo;</em>Motorline Renault Ashford (Aftersales)&rsquo; and &lsquo;Motorline Toyota Ashford&rsquo; both operating at the same retail park location. </span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="4.3" name="4.3"></a>4.3&nbsp;Pre-escalation entity checking</h4>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Before escalations can be raised to resolve duplicate issues, we should attempt to confirm whether a customer is asking us to make corrections to a valid entity, using the following steps:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check </span></span></span>the websites for each entity (if possible) to find out the company address</strong>. You can use this information to determine whether the addresses are the same (duplicate entity) or different (valid entity). Use the guidance above to determine if a listing should be merged or not.<strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check Street View on Maps</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> (if available) to confirm location&nbsp;information is accurate for the listings.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check&nbsp;</span></span></span>the customer is not trying to create multiple listings for virtual containment scenarios</strong>. For example, van rental listings or car dealers trying to create differing listings per make/model of car they support.<strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>the customer is not asking you to unmerge by-design entity matches.</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="5" name="5"></a>5. Escalation types</span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Although all Bing Places escalations should follow the steps outlined above, there are several specific requests which may require additional information or a slight change in basic handling.</span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>These are outlined below: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="5.1" name="5.1"></a>5.1 Location Open escalations</span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a customer&rsquo;s BPID listing is showing as <strong>Location Closed</strong> but they are actually open, we can escalate these cases to Global Support immediately for their assistance. We do not need to wait for a publish cycle to complete after marking it as <strong>Open</strong> in the UI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Global Support investigates why the Location Closed flag has been applied to the YPID and help in updating this to open status again as quickly as possible. Avoid setting expectations with the customer in case an FTW solution cannot be applied.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="5.2" name="5.2"></a>5.2 Data removal scenarios</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span>Common reasons that a customer requests the removal of listing data are: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Business has moved or has closed.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Business listing has an exact duplicate in Bing.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The customer requests to hide residential, shelter, or corporate office addresses. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The customer requests a listing be suppressed because it is fake or spam.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Customers may also request the removal of third-party listings due to them being inappropriate, irrelevant, or inaccurate.</span></span></span></span></li>

Given the high volume of queries, we must understandably prioritise key services and industries whose operation directly impacts the health and wellbeing of our search users. We appreciate your patience and understanding&nbsp;and advise you to use our new &lsquo;Temporary Closed&rsquo; feature or modify your operating hours using our existing tool functionality.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><em><span lang="EN-GB"></span></em></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>This option can be implemented by both customers and internal L1 Specialists without the need for an escalation. By marking a listing as closed, it will be updated on Bing Local to display the Location Closed status.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Listings marked as closed will continue to serve in SERP for a period of six months, after the six months they are removed from the results pages. This timeframe is for the benefit of search users who may have recently interacted with, or visited, the business listing/location. We allow them time to see that the business is no longer trading at a location before we remove this from Bing SERP.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Marking as <strong>Location Closed</strong>&nbsp;will not prevent a closed YPID listing from showing in SERP. Customers should be aware that they may still see the closed location during searches, for the reasons called out above.<br>
<br>
The <strong>Location Closed</strong>&nbsp;status should be applied to a listing when:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Business has ceased trading at a location.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Business has moved to a new location.</span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>Businesses which have moved should not update their old listing to a new location, as the YPID for their old listing is fed from multiple data feeds. These will be linked to the old address&nbsp;and could therefore cause the new address info to be incorrectly overwritten once the data pipeline refreshes.</span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-2"><span><span><span>In these scenarios, customers should create a new listing for the new business location, and use <strong>Location Closed</strong>&nbsp;to mark their old address as closed.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a id="5.2.3" name="5.2.3"></a><strong>5.2.3 Applying an FTW correction ﻿</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Although it will not remove data from Bing, FTW corrections can be used to overwrite YPID attribute data received from data feeds. Once applied, an FTW change bypasses the normal publishing process and applies the change straight to the published YPID. However, in many cases this will prevent future changes to the attributes&nbsp;being made.</span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For this reason, this scenario should only be applied to a listing when: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Changes have been submitted through the normal publishing process but have failed to take effect after a complete publish cycle. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>The customer&nbsp;has a verified BPID and reports Personal Data or competitor information in their YPID listing which requires urgent correction. For example, we have verified them as the owner of the account, checked that the BPID is verified, but the customer notes that the published YPID for their listing is showing either a personal phone or competitor&rsquo;s website URL.</span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;FTW may not always be the appropriate solution to this problem. When escalating for Personal Data/competitor data reasons, Global Support checks to see where the incorrect attribute data originates and may decide to suppress this data source rather than use FTW to modify the YPID itself. This would achieve the same results but would require a standard publish cycle to take effect.&nbsp;If this is the result, explain to the customer and only push back on Tier 2 if the customer threatens legal action to resolve their issue.</span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span>Customers&nbsp;who want their data to publish quickly, but who do not fall into the above scenarios, need to wait one&nbsp;standard publish cycle before we can escalate to request an FTW correction.</span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span>This option can only be implemented by Global Support. By merging the YPID of two separate listings, we connect their data feeds and create a single YPID, which is fed and updated by all these data feeds together.<br>
<br>
This scenario should be applied to a listing when:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Identical duplicate listings for the same business name/location appear on Bing Local listings.</span></span></span></span></li>

	</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the BPID is showing any status other than &lsquo;Published&rsquo; do not request a merge.</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> The pending pipeline data will overwrite the merged YPID information once published. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Once&nbsp;a merge request is created,&nbsp;<strong>advise the customer not to make any further edits, or to resubmit their listing</strong>.

	<li><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>If the customer does not have at least one BPID claimed, they need to use <strong>Suggest an Edit</strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For any other merge request (for example, the customer reports similar listings that they believe to be theirs, but which do not fall into the criteria listed above) advertisers need to use <strong>Suggest an Edit</strong> to report their concerns, as we are unable to confirm they are the correct owner of the &lsquo;duplicate&rsquo; listing.

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>This solution completely suppresses all data relating to this business on Bing.

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Business has been claimed, marked as <strong>Location Closed</strong>, and the customer complains about one of the following: </span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">

		<li><span><span><span><span>New business is showing, but closed business is ranking higher in SERP.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Business has ceased trading and they are receiving calls/visits from people still interested in their business.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For the above scenarios only</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>, we should first attempt to educate the customer on why we keep closed listings visible for six months, see </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/#2.2"><span><span><span>section 5.2.2</span></span></span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> for more information. If the customer continues to insist on suppressing a listing after you explain this, for these scenarios only, we can escalate for suppression.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Because of the impact suppressing a listing has on Bing search integrity, it is essential that we verify the customer as a valid business owner/representative before we submit a suppression request on their behalf.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If possible, check the YPID in LocalProbe to confirm that this is not a Protected Entity because they cannot be suppressed normally, as this causes a block in the publishing pipeline.

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>Confirm the customer signed in with a Microsoft account and received their confirmation email.&nbsp;If this did not occur, ask the customer to resubmit after signing in, and wait 14 days.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Ask the&nbsp;customer to provide you with the email they received (this also allows us to confirm the data they claim to have contacted support).</span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Customers sometimes contact CSS to request that reviews are removed from their published YPID; usually due to inaccurate or inappropriate feedback or sometimes due to the listing being irrelevant. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>This is not normally required, however; reviews are normally updated <strong>daily</strong>, with<strong> </strong>the most recent reviews shown first.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The number of reviews, and review sources, vary depending on the market and segment of the YPID.

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Locate the SERP image the customer wishes to remove and identify the feed source.

	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Ask the customer to confirm whether they own a business listing on the third-party site. If so, obtain the URL for their business and ask them to remove the image.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Manually confirm the image was removed on the third-party site, then allow 15 calendar days for our system to update.&nbsp; If the image continues to display after this date, escalate to Global Support for help refreshing the data. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the customer does not own a business listing on the third-party site, or insists that their image has been removed longer than 15 calendar days and you are unable to access the third-party page to manually confirm this, you can also escalate to Global Support for help refreshing the data or suppressing the image. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Non-escalation scenarios</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Customers complaining about specific BP images not being shown in their YPID, when there are already twenty high-quality images being shown.

	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Customer wants to have valid and relevant images suppressed from third-party feed sources.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Customers asking to have images removed because they are old or out of date (for example, hotels have been renovated, storefronts have been updated). </span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>In this scenario, we can request to have Bing Places images prioritised, but we would not accept requests to remove/suppress old images.

<h3><span><span><span><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. FAQ</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp;I already have business listings with you!&nbsp;Why am I being sent to the online &lsquo;Suggest an Edit/Feedback&rsquo; link?&nbsp;Why won&rsquo;t you help me?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span><span>The<strong> </strong>Bing Places for Business platform (and Bing Places Support teams) can help in claiming/editing Local Listings which you&rsquo;re able to successfully verify, but for listings with address information that cannot be verified we partner with the Bing Publishing Team via the Suggest an Edit&nbsp;process to report concerns with local listing accuracy. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Before we update a local listing that isn&rsquo;t linked to a claimed Bing Places listing, our Publishing team needs to first investigate and make sure that this isn&rsquo;t a valid business whose attributes have been merged with your business details on the back-end. For example, &lsquo;Contoso Print Team&rsquo; and &lsquo;Contoso Printing Team&rsquo; may be two valid and separate entities, who have accidentally been merged due to the similarity in name.) </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>To ask the team to review a local listing, you can use the <strong>Suggest an Edit</strong> link beneath the local listing on Bing, to share your concerns with them directly. These requests are processed within one to two weeks.</span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>In supported markets, you can also sign into Bing first using your Microsoft account; this way, once you submit feedback via <strong>Suggest an Edit</strong>, you can choose to receive a confirmation email. This lets you communicate directly with the publishing team to ask for updates or clarify any confusion they might have.</span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: Why won&rsquo;t you remove my old business listing from Bing? This location is closed, and I don&rsquo;t want to see it anymore. This is confusing to my customers!</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>We take the accuracy and integrity of Bing&rsquo;s search results very seriously. We understand that when a business ceases to trade at a location, the business owners will update their marketing to avoid confusing customers, who may continue to look for services at a previous location. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>To support customers who may have recently interacted with your business listing, or visited your store, we show listings as <strong>Location Closed</strong>&nbsp;on Bing for a period of six months.&nbsp;This gives our users time to see that businesses they are interested in have moved or ceased trading and avoids confusion with searchers who may be looking for a business they previously knew to operate in a location. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: Can I claim a listing and then use the &lsquo;delete&#39; function in the UI to delete the listing from Bing?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>This is not recommended. The <strong>delete</strong>&nbsp;function in the Bing Places Dashboard only removes the Bing Places feed source from your published listing.&nbsp;If your published listing is being supported from other sources, (for example: Yelp or TripAdvisor) it will continue to show, and may also become inaccurate if the third-party data is out of date. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Q: I have observed duplicate displaying on Bing. I have claimed the correct listing in Bing Places. Will this remove the duplicate listing?</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Yes, this will go through our publishing pipeline and merge with the duplicate listing. This will remove the duplicate from Bing after our next publish cycle completes.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Q:&nbsp;My competitor has three listings in Bing with exactly the same information. This is unfair and ruins my chances in getting ranked in Bing.</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>You can report this incident to our engineering team via the&nbsp;<strong>Suggest an Edit </strong>or <strong>Feedback</strong>&nbsp;link, displayed against the listings&nbsp;on Bing. This feedback is reviewed by our engineers, usually within one to two weeks.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: I&rsquo;ve claimed my old listing and updated it &ndash; but now you&rsquo;re telling me this isn&rsquo;t the right process? Why can&rsquo;t I just update my old listing?</strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>When a listing appears on Bing, it is a combination of data feeds from both Bing Places and other third-party sources. Each listing is assigned a &lsquo;YPID&rsquo; number, which you can find in the URL of the listing itself. This YPID is unique to the listing.<br>
When you update an old listing in Bing Places to a new address, the data feed for Bing Places sends this new information to the YPID listing, however because it&rsquo;s already associated to other feeds related to your previous address, this causes data conflicts and your updated information may not show as a result.<br>
To avoid this happening, the best practice is always to create a new listing in Bing Places for any new address your business moves to &ndash; this will trigger a new YPID to be generated exclusive to your new address, and any third-party data feeds relating to this new location will be merged over time through our publishing process.<br>
You can use the Location Closed&nbsp;feature in Bing Places to make sure old addresses are clearly marked as closed. After 6 months, closed locations will be removed from our search results. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Q: </span></span></strong><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Why can&rsquo;t I choose which review source I want to use?</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><strong>A:</strong> <span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Bing automatically displays the review sources which best align to your business segment/category. We understand that some advertisers may prefer specific review sources;&nbsp;however, to ensure fair representation and equal competition for all advertisers, Bing will only display trusted review partners which closely align to your business area.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Q: </span></span></strong><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Why can&rsquo;t you remove reviews I am unhappy with?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><strong>A:</strong> <span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>We understand that advertisers want to attract customers to their business, and we are happy to investigate any cases where the reviews displayed on Bing do not match with the majority of reviews/ratings being shown on a review provider&rsquo;s website. To provide Bing&rsquo;s search users with the most reliable, trustworthy experience, and to provide our advertisers with a fair competitive landscape, we are unable to remove negative reviews for our advertisers unless they have been deemed invalid and removed by the review provider first. In this scenario, work with the provider, and contact Bing once the review has been successfully removed, and we are&nbsp;happy to assist.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: I want to manage the images which show for my listing in Bing Places, but you&rsquo;re telling me I&rsquo;m not allowed to block third-party images. Why?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The Bing Places data feed is one of many sources we use to populate the information for local listings on Bing. While we strive to provide our business users with the best platform for keeping their information accurate, we also focus on providing Bing&rsquo;s end-users with relevant and informative information relating to their search query.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>By including relevant, quality images from our trusted partners (for example, TripAdvisor or Yelp) we can harness the power of crowd-sourced images in order to provide our users with great quality images that truly reflect our customer&rsquo;s businesses.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Assure the customer that if they see images which are not relevant to their business, or they believe to be poor quality, we can ask our publishing team to remove these for them. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span>Q:&nbsp; Why won&rsquo;t you let me use my preferred Business Name? It&rsquo;s my business and I&rsquo;ve claimed it (for example, why can&rsquo;t they say&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;Miamia Pizza &ndash; Pizzas, Burgers and More&rsquo;</em>&nbsp;instead of just&nbsp;<em>&lsquo;Miami Pizza?&rsquo;)?</em>&nbsp;</strong><em> </em><em><span lang="EN-GB"></span></em><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><br>
A</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>:&nbsp; Bing Local Listings are intended to be an accurate reflection of the business name/address found at your physical location, or on your website.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If you want to provide customers with more information regarding your business&rsquo; services/offerings, we recommend using <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-gb/h/a/microsoft-advertising" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Advertising</a> to create richer, more informative ad copy to target your customers.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>
