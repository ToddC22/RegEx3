<ul>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Bug Fix request</strong> - A bug fix may only be requested for currently released products that are in the mainstream support phase, or for products in the Extended support phase where the customer has an Extended Hotfix Agreement. Validate the support lifecycle phase by checking the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/lifecycle" target="_blank">Microsoft Product Lifecycle Site</a>.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Bug Fix Request &ndash; Extended Hotfix Support </span></strong><span lang="EN-GB">- Extended Hotfix Support (EHS) allows customers to request non-security hotfixes for select Microsoft software that has entered the Extended Support Phase. Eligibility for non-security hotfixes for software in extended support is only available for a specific set of On-premise products.</span></li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Critical Design Change Request (cDCR)</strong> - A cDCR is a requested change to a currently released product and may be raised only when it has been identified that the product is working as designed but that isn&#39;t meeting the customer&#39;s requirements, and the customer has a critical need for a design change.</p>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Non-Critical Design Change Request (ncDCR) </strong>- A ncDCR is a change request for a future product version and should be submitted when the behavior of the product does not meet the Customer&#39;s needs. Request of a non-critical design change does not imply that the submitted request for design change to the current product will be accepted.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If during troubleshooting it is identified that the product functionality is not meeting the customer&#39;s expectations:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li>See exceptions for <a bookmark-id="Proc2" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4345941#Proc2" managed-link=""><strong>Windows Client and Server - WDG</strong></a>.</li>
	<li>Research to identify if this is a known issue and if a previous fix or design change request has been submitted to the Engineering Group:
	<ul>
		<li>Previous requests can be searched using the BugCheck tool, or appropriate TFS instance with assistance of escalation services.</li>
		<li>Previously released fixes can be found using the Download Management Studio tool, or may be available to the customer directly by clicking the &quot;View and request hotfix downloads&quot; link on the public article.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Allow time for the customer to test any fix that is provided - don&#39;t close the case without customer authorization. If the customer confirms that the issue is resolved, then proceed to case closure.</li>
	<li>Continue troubleshooting to determine if the product behavior is as intended or not, making use of escalation resources as required. Work with the customer to understand their requirements, identify the need for a fix or change request and find what options are available to mitigate business impact:
	<ul>
		<li>If product behavior is not as intended, then consider if raising a bug fix request is appropriate.</li>
		<li>If product is working as intended but the design does not meet the customer expectations, then consider if a Design Change Request is appropriate:
		<ul>
			<li>For situations where resolving the customer&#39;s issue is critical based on business impact then proceed with creation of a Critical Design Change Request (cDCR).</li>
			<li>For situations where resolving the customer&#39;s issue is not critical, possibly based on the availability of workarounds to achieve the same result, consider creation of a Non-Critical Design Change Request (ncDCR).</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Work with escalation level resources to confirm your assessment and verify if proceeding with a request is appropriate:
	<ul>
		<li>Evaluate the feasibility of the change and whether:
		<ul>
			<li>It would negatively affect others or whether it would exclude or disable scenarios used by others.</li>
			<li>There would be any negative security implications or risks associated with a code change.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If this is not a security hotfix and the product is currently in extended support phase, then validate:
		<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
			<li>If they are a Premier Customer, then they confirm with the customers Incident Manager (IM)&nbsp;if they have purchased an Extended Hotfix Agreement</li>
			<li>If they are a Unified Advanced or Performance Customer, then they have access to extended hotfix support</li>
			<li>If the Product is covered by EHS using the Products covered by EHS <span>list below</span><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span></span>in <strong>supporting information</strong>.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Evaluate the bandwidth of Engineering Group<strong> &ndash; </strong>including security fixed and service packs, management mandates affecting priorities and core availability due to new OS work.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For Bug and cDCR requests &ndash; gather below information in partnership with IM in preparation for handoff to escalation services (data collection owner defined in parentheses):
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Problem Statement (Engineer)</strong> &ndash; A clear and concise description of the request.</li>
		<li><strong>Impact to Customer Business (IM for Premier <span lang="EN-GB">or Unified Support </span>customers)</strong> &ndash; An explanation of in what way this fix or change will impact the customer&#39;s business. Ideally this should include a cost analysis of the impact to the customer, which may include lost revenue, help desk calls etc.</li>
		<li><strong>Impact to present and future customers (Shared Ownership-IM/Engineer)</strong> &ndash; Any information on what ways this fix or change will also benefit other Microsoft customers.</li>
		<li><strong>Impact to Microsoft <span lang="EN-GB">(IM for Premier or Unified Support customers)</span></strong>&nbsp;&ndash; Any loss of business that will be incurred by Microsoft if the fix or change is not implemented.</li>
		<li><strong>Workaround Analysis (Engineer)</strong> &ndash; Analysis detailing what workarounds are available to the customer, why they are not suitable, and what negative impact (if any) those workarounds could cause if implemented in the customer&#39;s environment.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Escalation resource involvement is required and case may be escalated to enable the request to be logged in appropriate engineering group bug database.&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For Extended Hotfix Support, Escalation resource involvement is required and must be logged in the Engineering Group request that it relates to a product in extended support lifecycle. </span></span></span></li>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Notes:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Setting customer expectations:
	<ul>
		<li>Submission of a fix or change request does not guarantee or imply that the submitted request will be accepted.&nbsp;<span lang="EN-GB">Engineers should be cautious not to set high customer expectations that a fix will be produced.</span></li>
		<li><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span>EHS is only designed to address problems which cause crashes, lose data, or otherwise materially deviate from the product&#39;s documented functionality. EHS fix requests cannot provide added features, functionality, updates, or design changes.</span></li>
		<li>Design changes to current release products can be costly and high risk. Collection of business impact information is important so the Engineering Group can make an informed business decision.</li>
		<li>An entry in the product database is necessary for tracking of fix and change requests. Issues cannot however be confirmed as a bug until the Engineering Group has assessed and responded.</li>
		<li>Microsoft has a responsibility to ensure that any changes made do not cause other issues affecting the product, service or other customers. All changes are tested before being released publicly, which can be a lengthy process.</li>
		<li>Fix or change requests may be rejected for a few reasons, including time to fix, time to test, risk of destabilization to the product and the number of customers affected. Microsoft has a responsibility to all customers to ensure that the quality of the product is unaffected by any changes made.</li>
		<li><span lang="EN-GB">All Unified Advanced or Performance Support Customers are eligible for Extended Hotfix Support at no additional charge to their contract, and there is also no additional fee charged to the customer for creation of a hotfix.</span></li>
		<li><span lang="EN-GB">Avoid discussing the chance of requesting a hotfix for products in extended support with Unified Core Support customers. There is no option for them to purchase EHS as a contract add on, they would have to upgrade to Unified Advanced or Performance Support to become eligible.</span></li>
		<li><span lang="EN-GB">For Premier customers who don&rsquo;t have EHS, it may be possible to purchase it as an add on. Contact the customer&rsquo;s IM. </span></li>
		<li><span lang="EN-GB">Broad Commercial customers do not have access to EHS. </span></li>
