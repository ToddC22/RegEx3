<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span><br>
The Microsoft Cloud Solutions Provider (CSP) program is a programmatic approach to enable partners to sell Microsoft cloud products directly to customers and to own the full customer cloud lifecycle. The CSP program enables partners to sell cloud services in an integrated way by adding reselling, provisioning, billing, and support to their portfolio. In the CSP program:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The partner is adding their own managed services to Microsoft cloud services and selling this on a subscription basis to their customers.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Invoicing of individual customer usages is done by the partner. The customer gets an invoice for Microsoft services AND partner managed services by the partner, and they no longer receive any invoice from Microsoft.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The customer gets all support through the partner, and Microsoft only provides support to the partner.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span>Microsoft offers two business models for partners to leverage as a CSP. The Direct model requires a robust infrastructure to enable end-to-end ownership of the customer relationship. The Indirect model offers Resellers the opportunity to work with Distributors who can provide the tools and resources necessary to manage customer relationships. See below for more details about each model.</span></p>

<div class="kb-collapsible kb-collapsible-collapsed"><span><a class="bookmark" id="31"></a></span>

<h5 class="sbody-h5 text-subtitle"><span><span class="text-base">Direct CSP Model</span></span></h5>

<div class="kb-collapsible kb-collapsible-collapsed"><span>In the Direct CSP model, partners provide cloud services directly to customers and are responsible for all aspects of delivery, support, and billing.The Direct CSP model is appropriate for partners who have:</span>

<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li><span>Strong services offerings in their existing portfolio.</span></li>
	<li><span>A dedicated technical cloud support team, which is the first and only point of contact for customers according to customer needs.</span></li>
	<li><span>Tools (a billing engine) and processes to invoice all CSP customers.</span></li>
</ul>
<span>Some advantages of being a Direct CSP are:</span>

<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li><span>A strong relationship with Microsoft.</span></li>
	<li><span>Increased licensing margins by scaling efforts and providing strong standardized managed services.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="indent">&nbsp;</div>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Useful sample questions that help a partner understand what is involved in being a Direct CSP:</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Do you have the capability to bill customers for usage based billing?</span></li>
	<li><span>If so, what is the average cost per customer related to this activity?</span></li>
	<li><span>If so, how do you manage your pricing strategy to accommodate the liability risk of rebilling?</span></li>
	<li><span>Can you support front line support queries relative to the Microsoft products you are selling?</span></li>
	<li><span>If so, what is the average cost per customer related to this support and do you have Advanced Support for Partners or Premier Support to back up these resources?</span></li>
	<li><span>Do you use a portion of the margin provided by your CSP provider to adjust pricing in competitive situations?<span> </span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Indirect CSP Model</strong></p>

<div class="kb-collapsible kb-collapsible-collapsed"><span>In the Indirect CSP model, partners work with a Distributor to re-sell services to customers. Within this model a partner can either be a Distributor or a Reseller. The Reseller sells cloud service to customers, and the Distributor manages delivery, support, and billing aspects of the relationship. Distributors have been verified by Microsoft to have the systems and infrastructures in place to provide this robust level of support, so Resellers can focus on their customer offerings.<br>
<br>
The key requirements for being a Direct CSP are high and most partners do not fulfill them, or only fulfill some parts. These partners will not have enough revenue to profit as a Direct CSP. It is more beneficial and provides a better profit margin to start as a Reseller in the Indirect business model. The partner can always become a Direct CSP in the future once they build their services, billing, and support practices.<br>
<br>
Some advantages of being a Reseller in the Indirect CSP model are:</span>

<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li><span>A strong relationship with the Distributor.</span></li>
	<li><span>All key requirements (technical support, billing infrastructure, service offerings) of a Direct CSP are provided by the Distributor. The Reseller does not need to fulfill these requirements. The Reseller simply has to enroll with the Distributor of their choice and they can begin transacting.</span></li>
	<li><span>Cloud Distributors offer cloud platforms with a variety of additional services, and the Reseller can use and bundle these services with their own offerings.</span></li>
</ul>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>Partners are expected to understand the business investment they are making when they become a Direct Cloud Solutions Provider (CSP) and the commitment they are making in building a support practice. Prior to becoming a Direct CSP, partners need to read through all available information to ensure they understand Microsoft&rsquo;s expectations and how to best leverage Microsoft to build their own support offerings, managed services, and business solutions. Partners may call the RSC for guidance or with specific questions about the CSP program or onboarding process.<br>
<br>

<p><span><span lang="EN"><span><span>With regional authorization, partners with international businesses can more easily manage customers in different regions and countries around the world. This reduces the number of tenants that partners need to manage, reduces the billing dates that partners have to handle, and gives partners a more consolidated view of their sales.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN"><span><span>The list of Sales Territories can be found in this public article (section Country/region information):&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/regional-authorization-overview" managed-link="" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/regional-authorization-overview</span></span></span></span></a></p>

<p>If a partner wants to resell CSP licenses outside of their Sales Territory, this is possible by creating a CSP partner tenant located in the desired country/region. But note that the partner must have a legal address in the country they are trying to onboard to. This is required for vetting and Credit Check. They will then need to onboard to CSP again using that tenant and the MPN ID corresponding to that location ( If the partner doesn&rsquo;t have this yet, they will need to add that location in Partner Center, please refer to article <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4512647" managed-link="" target="_blank">4512647 </a>. Once showing as onboarded on that tenant, they can use it to sell to customers in that country/region.</p>

<p>If a partner determines that the Direct CSP model is suitable for their business, the RSC agent can guide them through the following enrollment process.</p>

<p><br>
<strong>Important:</strong> RSC should only provide this link and guidance to a partner after the partner has indicated that they have read the CSP web content and understand the commitment involved in becoming a Direct CSP. If the partner did not indicate or demonstrate this during the call, the RSC should provide the link with the following caution:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will give you the link to enroll as a Direct Microsoft Cloud Solutions Provider (CSP), but please keep in mind that signing up as a Direct CSP is a big commitment. It is important that you read and understand all of the information on the CSP web page before enrolling. You can access this webpage at <a href="https://aka.ms/aboutcsp" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/aboutcsp</a>.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: The MPN ID is the partner&rsquo;s HQ/Loc ID. The virtual Organization Partner ID will not be recognized in Partner Center so partner should enter their HQ/Loc ID for the MPN ID field.</p>

<p>Direct CSP Partners handle both customer interaction and distribution, being able to provide their customers with cloud services, cloud products, customer support and bill their customers directly.&nbsp;<br>

<p><span><span><span><span>After proceeding with the Enrollment, Partner Center requires the Partner to either enroll using their existing AAD tenant or create a new tenant. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If the Partner doesn&rsquo;t have these log in details and tries to cancel the login, Partner Center will display an error announcing that &#39;Your company already has a Partner Center account&#39; and give the Partner the option to contact their IT department via the built-in verbatim which, after pressing Send, will alert their Global Admin who can, in return, associate the user to the org with the correct permissions:</span></span></p>

From here, partners can navigate to a directory of Distributors, and the partner can contact each Distributor for more details and decide which is the best fit for their business needs. Once a partner has signed up with a Distributor, they can work with the Distributor directly to set up their processes, answer questions, and resolve issues.<br>
<br>
Important: RSC agents should not make any recommendation for a Distributor. Each Distributor has a different business portfolio, and it is the responsibility of the partner to assess each Distributor and make the right decision for their business.</span></span></span></span><br>

<p>It might be possible to reinstate enrolments that were rejected <strong><u>after June 2016</u></strong> -&gt; in this case RSC agents should still advise the partner that they have to re-apply with a different tenant, as their first answer. If there is a valid business case, agents can escalate to Operations (CAP queue: CBO_CSP)&nbsp;requesting if an exception can be made.</p>

<p>Background info: Reinstating will depend on the reason for rejection. If partner was rejected due to vetting issues, then Operations (CAP queue: CBO_CSP) can reinstate and retrigger the process. If they were rejected due to credit failure, then the partner will need to contact credit team to determine if their tenant can be reinstated. Operations (CAP queue: CBO_CSP) can only reinstate failed credit entries IF they receive communication from the credit team that the tenant is credit approved.<br>

<p><strong><span><span><a id="3" name="3"></a>Emails from the Credit Collections Team</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>As part of the CSP Application process, Partners need to pass a credit check.<br>
Therefore the credit team will reach out to applicants requesting financial documents. These emails will come from ucmwrcsp@microsoft.com.<br>
Partners should respond to these emails with the information requested or if they have any questions.<br>
<br>
If a Partner employee claims they have not received any credit request check, RSC agents should confirm that this individual is the actual Primary Contact for their tenant. If so, RSC agents will advise to look for emails from this sender: ucmwrcsp@microsoft.com. If no email was found, the Partner should reach out to the same email address to proceed with the credit check.<br>
<br>
RSC agents should NOT be providing any further information to rejected partners beyond the information stated by the WOCS Risk Team. Each partner receives a communication from WOCS indicating what has happened with the status of their application.</span></span><br>
