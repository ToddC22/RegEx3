<h3 class="sbody-h4"><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Instructions for all advocates&nbsp;</h3>

<p><span class="text-base"></span><strong>Important!</strong> When advocate tools go down, it is against Microsoft Privacy Guideline to record customer&#39;s personal information (including name, telephone number, address, email address, credit card information, PID, product key, and other information) anywhere other than in the appropriate advocate tools. Specifically, do not store this information, even temporarily, in documents on the computer or with pen or paper.<br>
<br>
For any of the outages for tools or services listed below, contact your manager to report the problem. The Team Manager should engage the tools escalation procedure through standard escalation (to CSS Command Center (CSS CC) or TPI, for example) submission so that the appropriate team can be contacted to resolve the problem.<br>
<br>
See KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3038858" managed-link="" target="_blank">3038858 Procedure: How and when to engage CSS Command Center (CSS CC) all regions</a><br>
<br>
<strong>Do not attempt to create an SR, escalate, or transfer the customer without direct instruction from your supervisor/lead or this article.<br>
If a support tool is down, most scenarios dictate the customer should call back later.</strong><br>

If the PA application is down, try to troubleshoot the tool. The PA application troubleshooting steps will help reduce escalations to Microsoft IT should you resolve the issue on your own. If you find the need to escalate an event to CSS Command Center (CSS CC) around one of the three identified PA application scenarios below, the PA application checklist will help Microsoft IT investigate application related issues with more efficiency and speed. The requested detail outlined in this checklist will hopefully help identify elusive root causes.

<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li>Follow&nbsp;your standard escalation procedures to CSS Command Center (CSS CC), which may include submitting an incident using EMP&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.service-now.com/ccsp/" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://microsoft.service-now.com/ccsp/</a>. See KB&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3038858" target="_blank">3038858 Procedure: How and when to engage CSS Command Center (CSS CC) all regions</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Immediately identify the application template (in accordance with the event&#39;s issue type) from the below and completely fill it out. Team Leads should send the completed template to CSS Command Center (CSS CC) </span></span></span></span><span><span><span>(</span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:csscc@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">csscc@microsoft.com</a></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>), </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>referencing your EMP incident number as a part of their escalation email.</span></span></span></span></p>
CSS Command Center (CSS CC) ensures this information reaches PACTHELP ASAP. The information requested in the checklist should always be included in the initial escalation to ensure we get as much information as we can to the correct teams. It is important to include all information being requested in the application templates, including the output details of the TraceRT, as this helps IT determine the&nbsp;cause. The goal is to minimize time lapse once PA tool issue has been identified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

<h3 class="sbody-h4">6. Surface</h3>

<h4 class="sbody-h4"><a id="6.1" name="6.1"></a>6.1 Contact handling</h4>
There may be times when a Surface agent cannot log in to the tools provided or certain functionality within the tool is not functioning. Since customer contacts continue to come in regardless, this procedure is meant to provide guidance on what to do when this happens. Here are some of the scenarios&nbsp;that are covered:

<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li>You cannot login to Assisted Support Desktop (ASD) OR some functionality within a&nbsp;tool&nbsp;is restricted (planned or unplanned)</li>
	<li>You cannot access <span asset="4346155" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4346155]</span></li>
	<li>You cannot access the Surface advocate portal (blog) or the Support Boundaries site</li>
</ul>
If the tools are down or malfunctioning and the Surface advocate cannot entitle the customer (for example, determine support eligibility), the expectation is that best effort support is provided within the boundaries that exist. We should verbally validate with the customer the state of their warranty and proceed with providing support. Transactions that require the customer&#39;s personal data to proceed will need to be halted, but any troubleshooting that can be performed with currently accessible content to resolve customer issues can still take place. Not being able to create an Incident within ASD should not block the Surface advocate from supporting the customer.<br>
<br>
<a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="" target="">Return to top</a>

<h4 class="sbody-h4"><a id="6.2" name="6.2"></a>6.2 Scenarios</h4>

<ol class="sbody-num_list" start="1">
	<li>
	<p>If a contact reaches you while you are having issues with tools, set expectations with the customer that you are facing some difficulties with tools.</p>
	</li>

<p class="indent-2">&quot;<span class="sbody-italic">We are currently experiencing difficulties accessing our systems and this may impact how I am able to assist you fully. I appreciate your patience</span>.&quot;</p>

<ol class="sbody-num_list" start="2">
	<li>Consult a site technical lead&nbsp;and report the tools issue. They will follow the Tools Performance Issues (TPI) procedure to report the issue to Microsoft.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Verbally&nbsp;validate the state of the customer&#39;s software and hardware warranty. In a case where the customer is outside of 90 days (software warranty) and/or 365 days WW, except&nbsp;for EU/730 days and except for UK (hardware) of purchase, advise the customer that&nbsp;even if they are outside of the free period for receiving support, you will still provide the best effort troubleshooting the systems that are down and that you do not have a way to validate the entitlement.</p>

&quot;<span class="sbody-italic">Since we are currently experiencing difficulties accessing our systems, I cannot validate the state of your warranty. Because I cannot validate, I will do my best to assist you now with the resources that are still accessible</span>.&quot;</p>

<p>If the scenario <span class="text-base">requires fully recovered tools access </span>(for example, creating a repair/fulfillment, refunding a Windows Marketplace content purchase, etc.), use the messaging below as guidance to set the right expectations.<br>
<br>
<strong>Repairs/Fulfillments messaging:</strong><br>
