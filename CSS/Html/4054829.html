<h3><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. FAQ</h3>

<p><strong>Q: Can I use the LSKU for any other reason?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> No, LSKU orders should only be used when a device is lost in transit. The following Special SKUs must be used instead of an LSKU to fulfill an order for the customer where Microsoft doesn&rsquo;t expect to receive a device and there is no lost device. These can only be used with GRAT approval via a TFS incident:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In Warranty-Flag Bypass-Advanced Exchange</li>
	<li>CARE Executive Escalation Advanced Exchange</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The CARE executive Escalation Advanced Exchange SKU is exclusive to the Customer &amp; Field Engagement Team, formerly known as the Executive Escalation Team (EET). Tier 3 advocates outside of this team who wish to use this SKU must receive GRAT approval via a TFS incident and document that in the notes of the ticketing tool.</p>
