The service impersonates the user by supplying a user name and password in the attempt to read or run the resource for the client. <br><br> To run a secure Web server, you must rigorously control access to Web content. With Windows and IIS security features, you can effectively control how users access Web content. NTFS files system permissions control access to physical directories on the server, and Web permissions control access to virtual directories on the Web site. You can configure Web permissions for specific Web sites, folders, and files on your server. Unlike NTFS permissions, which apply only to a specific user or group of users with a valid Windows account, Web server permissions apply to all users who access your Web site regardless of their specific access rights. <br><br> By setting Web server permissions combined with Windows NTFS permissions, you can control how users access your Web content on multiple levels, from the whole Web site to individual files. <br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='2'></a>How to Set NTFS Permissions for a File or Folder</h3> To set NTFS permissions for a file or folder: <br> <ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Start Windows Explorer, and then locate the file or folder that you want to set permissions for.</li><li>Right-click the file or folder, click <span class='text-base'>Properties</span>, and then click the <span class='text-base'>Security</span> tab.</li><li>To configure permissions for a new user or group, click <span class='text-base'>Add</span>. In the <strong class='uiterm'>Select Users, Computers, or Groups</strong>dialog box, type the name of the user or group that you want to set permissions for, click <span class='text-base'>Check Names</span> to verify the name, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.</li><li>To permit or deny a permission in the <strong class='uiterm'>Permissions for <strong class='sbody-strong'>User or Group</strong></strong> list, click the user or group in the <strong class='uiterm'>Group or user names</strong> list, and then click to select the <span class='text-base'>Allow</span> or <span class='text-base'>Deny</span> check box next to the permission that you want to permit or deny.<br><br><br> Or, to remove the group or user, click the user or group in the<br><strong class='uiterm'>Group or user names</strong> list, and then click <span class='text-base'>Remove</span>. </li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.</li></ol><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='3'></a>How to Set Permissions for Web Content</h3> To set permissions for Web content: <br> <ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Start IIS, or open the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) that contains the IIS snap-in.</li><li>Expand <span class='text-base'><strong class='sbody-strong'>ServerName</strong></span>, where <strong class='sbody-strong'>ServerName</strong> is the name of the server, and then expand <span class='text-base'>Web Sites</span>.</li><li>Right-click the Web site, virtual directory, directory, or file that you want to set permissions for, and then click <span class='text-base'>Properties</span>.</li><li>Click the <span class='text-base'>Home Directory</span>, <span class='text-base'>Virtual Directory</span>, <span class='text-base'>Directory</span>, or <span class='text-base'>File</span> tab (as appropriate).</li><li>Click to select or click to clear any of the following check boxes (if present), as appropriate to the level of Web permissions that you want to set: <br><ul class='sbody-free_list'><li><span class='text-base'>Script Source Access</span>: To permit users to access source code, select this option. Script Source Access includes source code for scripts, such as scripts in Active Server Pages (ASP)-based programs. Note that this option is available only if either Read or Write permissions are selected. <br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: When you select <span class='text-base'>Script Source Access</span>, users may be able to view sensitive information, such as a user name and password, from scripts in an ASP program. They can also change source code that runs on your server, which can seriously affect the security and performance of your server. It is best to handle access to these types of information and functions through individual Windows accounts and higher-level authentication, such as integrated Windows authentication.</li><li><span class='text-base'>Read</span>: To permit users to view or download files or folders and their associated properties, select this option. The Read permissions option is selected by default.</li><li><span class='text-base'>Write</span>: To permit users to upload files and their associated properties to the enabled folder on your server, or to change the content or properties of a Write-enabled file, select this option. </li><li><strong class='uiterm'>Directory browsing</strong>: To permit users to view a hypertext listing of the files and subfolders in this virtual directory, select this option. Note that virtual directories do not appear in directory listings; users must know the alias of a particular virtual directory.<br> <br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: An &quot;Access Forbidden&quot; error message is displayed by your Web server in a user&#39;s Web browser if the user tries to access a file or folder on your server when both of the following conditions are true: <br> <ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Directory browsing is disabled.<br> <br><br>-and-</li><li>The user does not specify a file name, such as<br> <strong class='sbody-strong'>Filename</strong>.htm in the Uniform Resource Locator (URL).</li></ul></li><li><strong class='uiterm'>Log visits</strong>: To record visits to this folder in a log file, select this option. A log entry is recorded only if logging is enabled for the Web site.</li><li><strong class='uiterm'>Index this resource</strong>: To permit Microsoft Indexing Service to include this folder in a full-text index of the Web site, use this option. This permits users to perform queries on this resource.</li></ul></li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>, and then quit IIS Manager, or close the IIS snap-in.</li></ol><span class='text-base'>NOTES</span>: <br> <ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>When you try to change security properties for a Web site or virtual directory, IIS checks the existing settings on the <span class='sbody-italic'>child nodes</span> (virtual directories and files) that are contained in that Web site or virtual directory. If the permissions set at the lower levels are different, IIS displays an <span class='text-base'>Inheritance Overrides</span> dialog box. To specify which child nodes should inherit the permissions that you set at the higher level, click the node or nodes in the <span class='text-base'>Child Nodes</span> list, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>. The child node or nodes inherit the new permissions settings.</li><li>If Web permissions and NTFS permissions differ for a folder or a file, the more restrictive of the two settings is used. For example, if you assign a folder Write permissions in IIS, and you grant a particular user group Read permissions in NTFS, those users cannot write files to the folder because the Read permissions setting is more restrictive.</li><li>If you disable Web server permissions (for example, Read permissions) on a resource, all users are restricted from viewing that resource, regardless of the NTFS permissions setting that is applied to those users&#39; accounts. If you enable Web server permissions (for example, Read permissions) on a resource, all users can view that resource, unless NTFS permissions that restrict access to it are also applied.</li></ul><a class='bookmark' id='4'></a></div><div><span>For additional information about how to configure security for files and folders, click the following article numbers to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br><div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-2' href='/EN-US/help/325361'>325361 </a> How To Configure Security for Files and Folders on a Network in Windows Server 2003<br></div></span></div><div class='kb-securedata-section section'><span class='text-base'>ClonePlaceholder<br><br><br>The following link to a Windows 2000 and IIS 5.0 article is a placeholder only and should  be replaced with the appropriate link to the Windows Server 2003 clone after the clone is created.</span><br><br><span>For additional information about how to set Web server permissions for Web content, click the article numbers below to view the articles in the Microsoft Knowledge Base: <div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-4' href='/EN-US/help/313075'>313075 </a> How To Set Web Server Permissions for Web Content<br></div></span></div><div class='kb-references-section section'> For additional information about access control in IIS, see the &quot;Access Control&quot; section in IIS Help.
