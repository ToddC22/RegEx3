<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This article discusses what advocates should do on the rare occasion the owner of a Microsoft Advertising account has a compromised account. Compromised accounts are those that have been hacked or hijacked by an unauthorized third-party. This often leads to excess charges on the advertiser&rsquo;s account.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>This issue is usually brought up in one of two ways:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The account holder contacts us inquiring about unknown charges or other suspicious account activity.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The internal fraud team identifies the compromise and follows the steps in KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4032951" target="_blank"><span><span><span>4032951 Process: Microsoft Advertising: Requests to T1 Support from Internal Partners</span></span></span></a> to have support contact the advertiser and rehabilitate the account.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<h3></h3>

<p>If an advertiser claims an unknown party has made changes to their account, do not use the words fraud or hijack when communicating with the advertiser. Until the account is escalated and confirmed as compromised, indicate that the issue requires further investigation.</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Validate whether the user in question is active or suspended and if there is a QBR compromise penalty on the account. If suspended and there is a QBR penalty for compromise, proceed with to <a bookmark-id="4" href="#4" managed-link=""><span>section 4</span></a></span></span><span><span>. Otherwise, treat the interaction as a standard billing dispute and proceed to step 2. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Pull a change history report and review the <strong>Changed by</strong> column with the advertiser to determine which changes were completed by a legitimate user. Highlight any disputed changes in the report and attach it to the ticket. This report is required for the fraud team to review the dispute and confirm validity.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Let the advertiser know that we will need to do a deeper investigation into their account, which will take up to five business days. Advise them to pause their campaigns during this time if they do not wish to accrue further charges.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>L2s/SMEs: Escalate the ticket to the fraud team, see KB </span></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3170756" target="_blank"><span><span><span>3170756 Process: Microsoft Advertising: Escalating to Partners using UCMT, COSMIC, and CAP</span></span></span></a><span><span> for further details. The fraud team will do a deeper investigation to determine if the account has been compromised and will get back to you either way. Be sure to specify the customer&#39;s callback number in the escalation. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>Once you have confirmation of a compromise, it will take about 24 hours for the outreach details to appear in UCMT. In the meantime, you can use these talking points:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;Our investigation has confirmed unexpected activity on this account. Rest assured the account has been paused until rehabilitation is complete.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>Once UCMT outreach details are available, confirm if it&rsquo;s the same person who escalated to CSS. If it is, you can move to <a bookmark-id="4" href="#4" managed-link=""><span>section 4</span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span>. <strong>If the user is NOT the same as outreach contact details,</strong> provide the talking point below:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;We are taking steps to rehabilitate the account and for security reasons, there is no additional information we can provide at this time. We will be working with the account administrator and assuming rehabilitation are completed, accounts may resume regular activity. Please work with the account administrator if you have further questions or concerns about future access to this account.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>If the user is not in the UCMT outreach details but claims they are the right contact, move to&nbsp;<a bookmark-id="4.1" href="#4.1" managed-link="">section 4.1</a></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol start="5">
	<li><span>If the fraud team confirms there was no fraudulent activity, see <a bookmark-id="3" href="#3" managed-link="">section 3</a></span><span> </span><span> for messaging.

<h3><span><a id="4" name="4"></a>4. Rehabilitate a Compromised Account</span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Once FraudAds investigation confirms a compromise, they will relay this to CSS. Following initial confirmation (typically within 24 hours) Fraud will provide rehabilitation details in UCMT. If not speaking with the eligible user, then advise them to contact an administrator for their advertising account. Otherwise, create a new Microsoft account. It could be that the account was proactively identified as compromised, but we were unable to establish contact at the time it occurred. If a UCMT ticket exists, you do <strong>not</strong> need to escalate again to revalidate but you <strong>do</strong> need to ensure the UCMT ID is properly documented in your ASD ticket. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 Inbound compromised user authentication</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p>Regular inbound authentication is insufficient to rehabilitate a compromised account from an inbound contact. To be eligible for reinstatement, the user in question MUST be listed in the UCMT ticket for the proactive outreach as being eligible. <strong>Do not</strong> escalate the user to the fraud team for reinstatement until the following actions are complete:</p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: If the customer references the SRX from a proactive rehabilitation, the caller can be considered automatically authenticated and you can skip to <span>User Rehabilitation</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Microsoft account password is reset.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Two</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>-factor authentication (TFA) is enabled.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Once the password is reset and TFA enabled, the Microsoft account is fortified via phone/text. <strong>Note</strong>: If the customer references the SRX from a proactive rehabilitation outreach, the caller can be considered automatically authenticated and you can skip to user rehabilitation. </span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Fortify the inbound caller using Phone/SMS-avoid email fortification whenever possible. Until the user is secured, do not send any other emails to the customer. </span></span></span></span></span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li><span><span><span><span>If the OneCloud caller ID or customer&#39;s preferred callback number matches the UCMT reliable contact phone number, proceed with user rehabilitation.</span></span></span></span></li>
			<li><span><span><span><span>If the caller does not provide a phone number that matches the reliable phone number provided in the UCMT ticket, do the following in order: </span></span></span></span>
			<ol>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span>Ask for an alternative phone number to match to the UCMT ticket.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span>Refer them to </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>another Super Admin to assist them with regaining access to the account (see talking point for: <strong>If the user is NOT the same as outreach contact details </strong>in<strong> </strong><a bookmark-id="2" href="#2" managed-link="">section 2</a>, step 4).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span><span>End the call and attempt to reach them using the reliable contact info provided in the UCMT ticket.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
