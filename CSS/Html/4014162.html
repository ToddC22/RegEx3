<p><span><span><span><span>This article describes the procedure to follow when customers contact wanting to change their alias on their Microsoft account, and are facing an error or unable to self-serve.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The customer should already have followed the steps outlined at </span></span><a href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/microsoft-account/change-email-sign-in-for-microsoft-account" target="_blank"><span><span>How to change the email address associated with your Microsoft account</span></span></a><span><span>. If the customer has not followed these steps, guide them through this procedure.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>This procedure must be used as a solution in the following scenarios:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A customer wants to change the primary alias on their Microsoft account but is unable to. This can happen due to one of the following reasons:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>They are unable to verify their third-party primary alias (no longer has access to receive verification code).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>They receive an error message when trying to rename an account with a Microsoft domain (such as live.com, outlook.com, Hotmail.com, and xboxlivefamily.com). </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>This procedure is NOT to be used as a solution in the following scenarios:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The customer has deleted the data associated to their Microsoft or Xbox Live account. Data deletions are permanent.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>They deleted a @hotmail, @live, or @msn alias. Deletion of these aliases is permanent and should be not be escalated to Microsoft-based Advanced Capability Advocates (ACA), as there is no further support available.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>They can&rsquo;t sign into their account.

<h4><span><span><span><span><a id="1.4" name="1.4"></a>1.4 Important note for removing an alias</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>You must only provide steps for a customer to remove an alias from an account if they are asking how a username or email can be completely disconnected from their account. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Removing the alias will have the following impacts: </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The customer can&rsquo;t sign in with that username</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>They can&rsquo;t access emails to that address if it was a Microsoft provided email address. </span></span><span><span>If they remove a non-primary Microsoft provided email alias, they won&#39;t be able to use it to send or receive email through Outlook.com, but existing mail will remain in their inbox.</span></span> </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>They will not be able to re-register that email address later. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Alias management will only change the username associated with their account. Removing an address will not change any behavior on the account except for the associated username and potentially the email that is registered within the account if it&rsquo;s a Microsoft provided email. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Never recommend a customer change or remove an alias to try to resolve an issue the customer is encountering on their account or give them the impression that they can use change alias to move account assets between accounts </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>(for example, gamertags).</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><a id="1.5" name="1.5"></a>1.5 Engagement: Alias rename exception</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>In certain cases, the customer may not be able to change their alias even if they can sign-into their account and can access their security proofs. </span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If all the above steps in sections 1.1 - 1.3 have been completed, and the customer still cannot rename their alias, follow the steps below.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer receives the error message: &quot;Y<em>ou already renamed this account, please try again later.&quot;, </em>they may have hit their rename limits. The ACA team can override the rename limit once per year, so check to see if the customer has been previously escalated to them for this same issue within the last year. </span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>If they have not, escalate to ACA using the procedure below. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>If they have been previously escalated to ACA for this same issue, explain to the customer they will have to wait a period of time and try to rename again later. <strong>Do not reveal to the customer that there are rename limits as that may expose security risks.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></li>
