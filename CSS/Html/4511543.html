	<li><span>This article describes how to identify and how to handle Surface devices with a possible expanded battery.

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Expanded battery orders are <strong>to</strong> <strong>be used only for expanded battery</strong> situations where the customer has provided <strong>videos</strong> of the device showing the issue and the serial number and should never be used for any other issue. If the issue <strong>has not </strong>been confirmed through <strong>videos</strong>, an expanded battery order <strong>should not be used</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Expanded batteries will be covered at no cost for three years from the original purchase date. After three years there will be a charge for the exchange if the device still has out of warranty (OOW) support. For more information on this, see the FAQ section in KB </span></span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4508455" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>4508455 Procedure: Surface: Expanded/Swollen battery or bulging screen overview</span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>There is <strong>no grace period</strong> for the expanded battery policy. If the customer is one day over the three years, the device is OOW and no longer qualifies for the expanded battery policy.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Do not</span></span></strong><span><span> use the &ldquo;Escalation (Swollen Battery)&rdquo; offer at any time. This is for escalations to T3 Redmond <strong>only</strong> as it requires special handling due to the unique nature of the order<em>.</em></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> <strong>Follow only the exact steps for the customer&rsquo;s regional device location</strong>. If the steps are not followed exactly this will cause issues with the order and delays for the customer as the steps for exchange of an expanded battery do differ based on the customers location.</span></span></span></span></p>
