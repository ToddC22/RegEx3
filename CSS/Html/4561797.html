Each team should select the relevant program e.g. CED specialists should select the CED program, SAM the Advanced Support for Partners program.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

If the partner is based in a country significantly outside the timezone for the language they prefer, ask if they speak English or must speak the specific non-English language. For example, if based in USA and they want Japanese language, ask if they can be supported in English instead of Japanese. If they need Japanese language, then they should indicate their availability during the USA / Japan timezone.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Country</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> should be selected with care because it indicates the time zone the partner is located in.
