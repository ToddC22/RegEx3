<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This TSG explains how to address a variety of unexpected behaviors which indicate that a customer&#39;s Azure account is in an &ldquo;orphaned&rdquo; state.</p>

<p><span><span>When an Azure account is orphaned, the MINT account associated with the Operation Management Suite (OMS) Commerce Account ID (CAID) is exposed in CMAT. For guidance on identifying orphaned accounts, see <span>the <em><a bookmark-id="SupportScenarios" href="#SupportScenarios" managed-link="">Support Scenarios</a> </em>section</span> below.</span></span></p>

<h3><a id="CustomerExperienceAndProvisioning" name="CustomerExperienceAndProvisioning"></a>Customer Experience and Provisioning</h3>

<p>A customer may experience a variety of unexpected behaviors in their portal which indicate that their Azure account is in an orphaned state, such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>When the customer logs in to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure portal</a>, a message may appear stating something like &ldquo;You do not have any subscriptions.&rdquo;</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p>In this case, the customer is not able to view or manage their existing subscriptions.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The customer may not be able to do the following:</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p>Log in to their account in the <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure portal</a>.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Change their billing information or payment instrument (PI).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Download invoices or usage reports.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Remove the spending limit of a subscription that has hit its monetary capacity.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Redeem tokens or Online Services Activation (OSA) keys.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Add credits via credit card.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Perform certain actions on their subscriptions, such as clicking the <strong><em><span><span>Add Digital Partner of Record</span></span></em></strong> button.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Guidance on addressing these issues can be found in <span>the <a bookmark-id="SupportScenarios" href="#SupportScenarios" managed-link=""><em>Support Scenarios</em></a> section</span> below.</span></span></p>

<h3><a id="SupportScenarios" name="SupportScenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<h4><a id="IdentifyAnOrphanedAccount" name="IdentifyAnOrphanedAccount"></a>Identify an Orphaned Account</h4>

<p>The following actions by a customer may result in the orphaning of their account:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span>Changes</span><span> the Microsoft Account (MSA) or Organizational Account (Org ID) email address of the Account Administrator (AA).</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Deletes the AA&rsquo;s Org ID account in the Azure Active Directory (AAD).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Deletes and then recreates the AA&rsquo;s Org ID account in the AAD.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Removes the AA&rsquo;s email address from the associated directory.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Adds an alias to the MSA or Org ID of the AA&rsquo;s email ID.<span> </span><span> </span></p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Orphaned accounts may also result from systemic issues in the Azure platform, such as an error during the backfilling of an account from MINT to OMS.</p>

<p><strong><a id="VerifyThatAnAccountIsOrphaned" name="VerifyThatAnAccountIsOrphaned"></a>Verify that an Account is Orphaned</strong></p>

<p>When a customer&rsquo;s account is orphaned, their existing subscription will not appear when they log in to the <a href="https://account.azure.com/Profile">Account Center</a>. Instead, they will see an option to create a new subscription.</p>

<p>Searching for an orphaned account in CMAT using the customer&rsquo;s email address will display the associated MINT account. However, searching for the account using the customer&rsquo;s subscription GUID will show that the account is already on OMS and is thus considered orphaned.</p>

<p>For example, a search in CMAT using the subscription GUID 7a0392cf-0f7a-4eda-8953-e63a9780**** yields an email address field of <strong><em><span><span>N/A</span></span></em></strong>. However, a<span> search using the email address associated with this Azure account will show </span><span>the MINT account bmVpLgAAAAAAA</span>***<span> </span><span> </span>.<span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>This means that the email address associated with the Azure account is deleted from the AAD. As a result, the associated Azure account is considered orphaned.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Leverage the <em>Scenarios and Solutions</em> table below to determine the steps needed to address the customer&rsquo;s specific issue.</p>

<p><strong><a id="ScenariosInvolvingSOTs" name="ScenariosInvolvingSOTs"></a>Scenarios Involving SOTs</strong></p>

<p>In most cases, orphaned account issues can be resolved using a Subscription Ownership Transfer (SOT) by following the guidelines in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3040383/">TSG 3040383</a>.</p>

<p>If the solution to the customer&rsquo;s issue involves a SOT:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Ensure that the customer&rsquo;s PI is valid so that their balance can be processed before a SOT is performed.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the customer has an outstanding account balance that is greater than the empowerment of the <span>Service Engineer (SE) or Technical Advisor/Partner Technical Advisor or Manager&nbsp;</span>(TA/PTA/M1)<span> </span><span> </span>, <span>ask the customer to make a one-time wire transfer to clear the outstanding balance before proceeding with the SOT</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span>.</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p>For guidance on performing wire transfers, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658076">TSG 2658076</a>.</p>
