<header><h1>Cannot administer Routing and Remote Access service when the Remote Registry service is stopped</h1></header><div class='kb-symptoms-section section'> When you disable the Remote Registry service beforestarting the Routing and Remote Access service, you cannot view or change the Routing and Remote Access service configuration. If you disable the Remote Registry service while the Routing and Remote Access service is running, the Routing and Remote Access service may appear to function correctly and then experience intermittent connection failures.<br><br> When you try to view the properties of the Routing and Remote Access service server, you may receive an error message that is similar to one of the following messages: <div class='sbody-error'> You don&#39;t have the required permissions to view the properties. </div><div class='sbody-error'>You do not have the required permissions to view the properties.</div></div><div class='kb-cause-section section'> This behavior occurs if you have disabled the Remote Registry service and you try to configure the Routing and Remote Access service. The Routing and Remote Access service Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-in reads and writes registry values. (This dependency also exists when you use NetShell to configure the Routing and Remote Access service.) Any situation that requires the Routing and Remote Access service to access configuration data, such as restarting the service or rebooting the system, causes the Routing and Remote Access service to stop functioning when the Remote Registry service is disabled. </div><div class='kb-resolution-section section'> To resolve this behavior, stop the Routing and Remote Access service, start Remote Registry service, and then restart the Routing and Remote Access service.
