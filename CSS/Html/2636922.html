<h3><a name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This TSG provides guidance on the most effective ways to handle assigned and incoming cases. It covers both mandatory procedures and best practices.</p>

<h3><a name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<p>Refer to our TSGs in <a href="https://servicedesk.microsoft.com/#/knowledge">Service Desk Knowledge</a> for the most up-to-date content.<br>
Be aware that our processes change frequently, and that the TSGs should have the most current guidance available.</p>

<p><strong>Important</strong><strong>:</strong> Storing reference content locally (in formats including, but not limited to OneNote, Word, Excel, and similar) will result in the local content becoming stale, and no longer providing the most current customer guidance. Not following the most current content on <a href="https://servicedesk.microsoft.com/#/knowledge">Service Desk Knowledge</a> can result in errors that lead to customer confusion and management escalations.</p>

<h4><a name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h4>

<h4><strong><a name="Case State and Status"></a>Case State and Status</strong></h4>

<p>Throughout the life of your case, ensure the <strong>State </strong>and <strong>Status</strong> of your case are set appropriately.<br>
For more information about setting the <strong>State</strong> and <strong>Status</strong> of your case, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2119581">TSG 2119581</a> (Service Desk Case Workflow).</p>

<h4><a name="Case Workflow Process"></a>Case Workflow Process</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Review the customer&rsquo;s request to determine if the case is within ASMS&rsquo; scope.
	<ul>
		<li>If any details are missing from the case that will prevent you from determining whose scope it is or providing next steps, engage your technical advisor (TA), partner technical advisor (PTA), or team lead (TL).</li>
		<li>If appropriate to your situation, you can also request additional information from your customer .</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If the case is within ASMS&rsquo; scope, accept ownership of the case.<br>
	If not, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3104062">TSG 3104062</a> (Misroutes and Duplicates) or work with your TA, PTA, or TL to determine who should own the case.
	<ul>
		<li>Any cases assigned to the supplier teams should remain within those teams and should not be handed off between suppliers.<br>
		<strong>Note</strong>: If there are no support engineers (SEs) trained on a specific skillset within the supplier team, then tasks and cases may be handed-off to the ASMS main queues based on the routing product.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Prepare and send first quality response (FQR) communications.<br>
	For more information, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2777192">TSG 2777192</a> (First Quality Response).
	<ul>
		<li>If you are contacting a customer via phone, pay attention to the time zone of the customer, as it may be early in the morning or late at night.<br>
		However, you may contact them via email or another method if you are unable to contact them by phone.</li>
		<li>When you call the customer, follow up with them afterwards with an email. Include the details of the phone conversation to ensure that both the customer and the SE have the conversation documented.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
	<li>Begin troubleshooting the customer&rsquo;s request.
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Document all findings and actions taken in your Case Notes .</li>
		<li>Check if the customer has already attempted to resolve the issue by verifying the steps taken, to prevent duplication of effort.</li>
		<li>Do not document any customer personally identifiable information (PII).<br>
		For more information, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3017606">TSG 3017606</a> (How to Submit a Privacy Incident).</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>When a solution has been reached, provide the customer with your findings.
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>If the initial solution did not work, repeat steps 4 and 5 until the customer confirms resolution. You can also engage your TA, PTA, or TL for further assistance.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>After the customer has confirmed the solution, close the case following the proper case closure process in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/en/help/2589957">TSG 2589957</a> (Case Closure Handling (Unresponsive Customer, Confirmed Close)) and <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/en/help/2658158">TSG 2658158</a> (Product and Root Cause Coding Guidelines).</li>
</ol>

<h3><strong><a name="Best Practices"></a>Best Practices</strong></h3>

<h4><strong><a name="Qualifying Your Customer"></a>Qualifying Your Customer</strong></h4>

<p>Your customer may require a more detailed explanation of the steps available on the public facing website, or are able to perform instructions with only high-level instruction and minimal guidance.</p>

<p>Your customer may fit under either of the following categories:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Novice</strong>: These customers need specific steps, ask many questions, and require you to walk them through troubleshooting. They may not know how to navigate the portal.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Knowledgeable or Technical</strong>: These customers use technical jargon, often troubleshoot their own issues, and can navigate the portal very well.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><a id="Swarming" name="Swarming"></a>Swarming</strong></h4>

<p><span><span>Swarming is &#8203;a behavior and mindset that puts the customer first. It is about forming informal teams, focused on doing what&#39;s right for the customer and matching a sense of urgency, with the emphasis on taking ownership of the issue instead of handing it off to a colleague.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>To learn more about Swarming and how it applies to ASMS see the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/ASMS%20Swarming%20Guide.docx?d=w9578407044704552bf1668ad307e5638&amp;csf=1&amp;e=rWEn7L" managed-link="" target="_blank">ASMS Swarming Guide.docx</a>.</p>

<h4><a name="Prioritizing Your Cases"></a><strong>Prioritizing </strong><strong>Your Cases</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Prioritize your cases from oldest to newest, then work them to case closure as soon as possible.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Customers become less responsive the longer a case is open.</li>
		<li>After three to four days, customer communication frequency quickly declines.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Organize your cases by time zone.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Reach out first to customers whose business hours start and end earlier during your shift .</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Review emails for customer responses.</li>
	<li>Address customer concerns or prioritize the case to follow up on additional actions, troubleshooting, or partner engagement.</li>
	<li>Send any strike or closure emails .
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>For more details, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/en/help/2589957">TSG 2589957</a> (Case Closure Handling (Unresponsive Customer, Confirmed Close)).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Check the status of active partner engagements and follow up as needed.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Case Buddy"></a><strong>Case Buddy</strong></h4>

<p>Case Buddy is a tool that can give you some advanced sorting and categorization options of your queue. Use of this tool is not required. For more information, see the following links:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/EAST/SitePages/Case-Buddy.aspx">Case Buddy Documentation (SharePoint)</a>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/activity/S3034760/launch/#/">Case Buddy Training</a></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Some of the above documentation makes references to MSSolve, which is no longer available. However, this tool also integrates with Service Desk Case.</p>

<h4><strong><a name="Severity"></a>Severity</strong></h4>

<p>Every case has a severity. It is imperative that you review and understand the severity of all your cases. Case severity helps you prioritize and determine the response time needed for each case. Follow the guidelines explained in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2777192">TSG 277192</a> (First Quality Response).</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Some cases may have higher support entitlements, which have different service-level agreements (SLAs). In those instances, refer to <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2786284/asms-support-entitlement-handling">TSG 2786284</a> (Support Entitlement Handling) for more details.</p>

<p><a name="Downgrading from a Severity A Case"></a><strong>Downgrading from a Severity A Case</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Do not downgrade a Severity A case without approval from the customer, partner, or technical account manager (TAM) unless they become unresponsive. If you are unsure whether to downgrade a Severity A case, discuss the situation with your TA, PTA, or TL.</li>
	<li>Severity A cases require the customer to be available 24/7 until the issue is resolved.</li>
	<li>If a customer with a Severity A case becomes unresponsive, the original engineer can downgrade the case to a Severity B and continue to work on it.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>If you do this, inform the customer via their preferred communication method that because they have not responded, we have lowered the severity of the case, and will continue to work on it as a Severity B. After the customer responds, you can decide if the case should remain at Severity B.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><a name="Upgrading to a Severity A Case"></a><strong>Upgrading to a Severity A Case</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>If a customer opens a Severity B or Severity C case but has a qualifying Severity A issue, proactively raise the case severity on behalf of the customer as long as the customer is available to work on the issue 24/7.</li>
	<li>If the customer is not available 24/7, raise it no higher than Severity B.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Customer Communication"></a><strong>Customer Communication</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Proactively communicate on each case you own, ensuring we help our customers and that you obtain accurate information.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>The quality and value of communications with customers are key drivers of customer satisfaction.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Meet the case-update SLA, as was communicated to the customer in your FQR email.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Be prepared to report updated information when you are reaching out to your customer.</li>
		<li>If you do not have relevant or updated information to report to the customer, engage your TA, PTA, or TL <strong>.</strong></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Do not avoid tough questions.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Answer them honestly, whether the answer is positive or negative.</li>
		<li>Giving the customer a clear, honest response promotes good communication.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Avoid asking questions to the customer simply to delay case closure.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Research the case and next steps before contacting the customer to ensure that each interaction is as comprehensive as possible and avoids unnecessary communication delays.</li>
		<li>For more details, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2777192">TSG 2777192</a>(First Quality Response).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a name="Email"></a>Email</strong></p>

<p>Personalize emails to customers using information specific to their environment, their Azure subscription, and the problems they are experiencing. This provides a professional-level support experience. However, you should consult the appropriate troubleshooting or team engagement TSG for guides on what information needs to be collected, so you get the correct information the first time.<br>
Use the following best practices for your customer emails:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Respond to customers as early and often as possible.</li>
	<li>Always double-check for spelling or grammatical errors.</li>
	<li>Make sure the communication contains detailed, useful information that is relevant to the customer.</li>
	<li>CC <a href="mailto:support@mail.support.microsoft.com">support@mail.support.microsoft.com</a> on every email you send to the customer.</li>
	<li>Follow the guidelines outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2589957/asms-case-closure-handling-unresponsive-customer-confirmed-close">TSG 2589957</a> (Case Closure Handling (Unresponsive Customer, Confirmed Close)) for handling unresponsive customers and customer confirmed case closures.</li>
	<li>If a customer&rsquo;s email comes back as &ldquo;undeliverable,&rdquo; attempt to call the customer.</li>
	<li>Only add the customer and case email (<a href="mailto:support@mail.support.microsoft.com">support@mail.support.microsoft.com</a>) to internal threads when the internal team requests to have them added.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>If you need to start a thread with an internal team, be sure the customer is <strong>not</strong> on the internal thread.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Verify that the communication contains details of the status and the next steps as they relate to the customer&rsquo;s support request.</li>
	<li>Customers can communicate with the SE by leaving comments on the support case in the Azure portal.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>When this occurs, the customer&#39;s message will be documented in the <strong>Communications</strong> tile of Service Desk Case. The engineer who currently owns the case will receive an email.</li>
		<li>For more details, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2119581">TSG 2119581</a> (Service Desk Case Workflow).</li>

<p><a name="Phone"></a><strong>Phone</strong></p>

<p>Contacting the customer by phone is just as important as contacting the customer by email. Using the proper phone etiquette is vital to a positive customer experience.</p>

<p>When contacting a customer via phone, remember to do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pay attention to the customer&rsquo;s time zone and any special time periods in which they would like or not like to be contacted.</li>
	<li>Always speak of fellow groups and teams inclusively , to show that we are working together.<br>
	For more details about speaking of teams and groups inclusively, refer to the <em>Communication Tips</em> section in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4346059">TSG 4346059</a>.<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> This TSG is not owned by ASMS.</li>
	<li>If the customer is not available on the first call, be sure to leave a voicemail with the following details:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Who you are.</li>
		<li>Why you&rsquo;re calling.</li>
		<li>How you can be contacted.</li>
		<li>Next steps.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If the customer has also provided an email, send the customer a follow-up email in addition to your voicemail as soon as possible.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Closing Test Cases"></a><strong>Closing Test Cases</strong></h4>

<p>To close a test case using Service Desk Case, perform the following procedure:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Under <em>Agent Identified Root Cause</em>, select <strong>Root Cause - Azure Sub Mgmt V1\Misroute\Duplicates &amp; Test Cases\Test Case</strong> .</li>
	<li>Under <em>State</em>, select <strong>Closed</strong>.</li>
	<li>Under <em>Status</em>, select <strong>Duplicate</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<p>When closing a test case in Service Desk, note the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Provide documentation that this is a test case in the <strong>Customer Statement</strong>, <strong>Internal Title</strong>, and <strong>Case Title</strong> fields.</li>
