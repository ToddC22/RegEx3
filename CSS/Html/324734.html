If you lose the Full Control permission for this folder, Windows creates a new user profile folder the next time that you log on to the computer. You can no longer access the original user profile folder unless you have local administrative creditials on the computer.<br><br> By default, when Windows creates a new profile folder for you, Windows places the folder in the Documents and Settings folder. Windows tries to use your user name as the name of the new profile folder. However, if the old profile folder still exists, Windows modifies the name of the new folder to avoid duplication. When this occurs, you may see multiple profile folders for your user profile. The following information describes the default naming scheme that Windows uses for user profiles: <br> <ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>If the <strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong> folder does not already exist, Windows names the new profile folder:<div class='indent'><strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong></div></li><li>If the <strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong> folder already exists, Windows names the new profile folder:<div class='indent'><strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong>.<strong class='sbody-strong'>ComputerName</strong></div></li><li>If the<br><strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong>.<strong class='sbody-strong'>ComputerName</strong>folder already exists, Windows names the new profile folder:<div class='indent'><strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong>.<strong class='sbody-strong'>ComputerName</strong>.000<br></div></li><li>If the<br><strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong>.<strong class='sbody-strong'>ComputerName</strong>.000 folder already exists, Windows uses the next available increment of the<br><strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong>.<strong class='sbody-strong'>ComputerName</strong>.000 naming scheme.<br><br> For example:<div class='indent'><strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong>.<strong class='sbody-strong'>ComputerName</strong>.001<br></div></li></ul> You can also tell the order of the multiple profile folders by looking at the creation date or time, as long as the creation date or time has not been modified.<br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='2'></a>Requirements to Restore a User Profile</h3> To restore a user profile, the Documents and Settings\<strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong> profile folder must still exist, and you must have the Full Control permission for this folder. If you do not have the correct permission for your user profile folder, you (or another user) must first log on to the computer as an Administrator and restore the required level of permission to your user profile.<br><br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='3'></a>To Copy Documents from the Current Profile Folder to the Appropriate User Profile Folder</h3> If you have logged on to Windows since you lost access permission to your original profile folder, at least two user profile folders exist that use your user name. To make these files accessible from the user profile that you want to restore, follow these steps: <br> <ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Log on to the computer as an Administrator.</li><li>Copy all documents from your current My Documents folder to the My Documents folder of the profile that you want to restore.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: You do not have to follow this step if you moved your My Documents folder to a location outside the Documents and Settings folder; however, after you restore your user profile, you may have to re-specify the destination folder location of the My Documents folder.</li><li>To retain the Internet links on your Favorites list, copy all Internet shortcuts from your current Favorites folder to the Favorites folder of the user profile that you want to restore.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: Do not copy the Desktop.ini file.</li></ol><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='4'></a>To Grant Full Control Permission for the User Profile Folder</h3><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Start Windows Explorer.</li><li>Locate and right-click your old user profile folder, and then click <span class='text-base'>Properties</span>. <br><br> By default, this folder is %SystemDrive%\Documents and Settings\<strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong>.</li><li>Click the <span class='text-base'>Security</span> tab. </li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>Group or user names</strong> list, click your user name, and then in the <strong class='uiterm'>Permissions for<br><strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong></strong> box, click to select the <span class='text-base'>Allow</span> check box that is next to <span class='text-base'>Full Control</span>.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: If your user name does not appear in the <strong class='uiterm'>Group or user names</strong> list, click <span class='text-base'>Add</span>, type your user name under <strong class='uiterm'>Enter the object names to select</strong>, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.</li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.</li></ol><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='5'></a>To Edit the User Profile Registry Key</h3><span><span class='text-base'>Important</span> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs.
