<h4><strong>Why is FQR important? </strong></h4>

<p>By ensuring that pre-work is done before contacting the customer, and that the engineer is prepared to immediately scope and initiate working the case. &nbsp;&nbsp;The time to initial contact may be slightly longer, but customer satisfaction is higher because the issue gets resolved or progress toward resolution is made in the first contact. The aim is to eliminate non-value-added activities. The customer should come away from their initial interaction feeling they are working with someone who is going to quickly resolve their situation.</p>

<h4 id="Guidelines"><strong>Guidelines</strong></h4>

<p>At a minimum, the first customer interaction must &nbsp;progress the customer&rsquo;s issue towards resolution.</p>

<p>The elements an FQR response must include to ensure &nbsp;high quality &nbsp;are:.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Clearly defined scope</strong>. Ensure the customer&rsquo;s issue and expectations are correctly understood.</li>
	<li><strong>Advance the issue toward resolution.</strong> Minimize the customer&rsquo;s effort to resolve the problem.<strong> </strong></li>
	<li><strong>Demonstrate empathy, showing you&rsquo;re deeply listening to the customer.</strong> Communicate in a human, personal way; avoid sounding robotic.<strong> </strong></li>
	<li><strong>M</strong><strong>atch the customer&rsquo;s sense of urgency. If it is not clear, ask the customer.</strong></li>
	<li>Minimize transfers before contacting the customer.</li>
	<li>Respond within the initial response goal.</li>
	<li>Show leadership with the customer by describing our plan to resolve the problem, and get the customer&rsquo;s alignment, before proceeding.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>Pre-Work</strong></h4>

<p>Before contacting the customer, ensure pre-work is done so that you are able to progress the case during the initial contact. The following pre-work items will help you be prepared for a quality engagement:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Research the customer&rsquo;s error code or problem description.</li>
	<li>When possible, develop a potential First Contact Resolution (FCR) plan before engaging the customer.</li>
	<li>Know the customer by reviewing:
	<ul>
		<li>The <strong>Customer Support Health Dashboard</strong> for customer overview, products deployed, case history or related past cases, customer sentiment, and critical cases pending.</li>
		<li>The <a href="https://azuresupportcenter.msftcloudes.com/caseoverview" target="_blank">Azure Support Center (ASC)</a> for Azure cases.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Know the issue by carefully reviewing the case information. Do <strong>NOT</strong> miss:
	<ul>
		<li>Attachments, Customer files, and Flashes</li>
		<li>Automated Reports filed in customer communications (for example <strong>Azure Subscription Management Billing Helper</strong> report)</li>
		<li>Other requirements (for example, looping in additional contacts on email communication)</li>
		<li>Severity of the reported problem</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Know the offerings and implications
	<ul>
		<li>Service Offering:
		<ul>
			<li>Including any special handling requirements, for example Microsoft Unified Support Offering.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Service Offering SLA.</li>
		<li>Any Entitlement to 24x7 support.</li>
		<li><span>Any special handling requirements, for example Support Mission Critical.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Identify available resources (Solutions, Standard Workflows, Known Issues, Tools and People):
	<ul>
		<li>Engage swarming for advice / direction if necessary, prior to first contact (see <a data-content-id="4464163" data-content-type="article" href="" managed-link="" target="_blank">KB 4464163&nbsp;|&nbsp;Procedure:&nbsp;Swarming</a>)</li>

<h4><strong>Additional Quality Guidance</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li><span>As good practice you can email the customer or partner to make them aware that you will contact them within 30 minutes, or first thing next business day, using the Callback Commitment template:</span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>This template does not mean IR is met. You will still need to have contacted the customer according to their contact preferences, as described above.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>First Contact Action Items</strong></h4>

<p>Types of items to be performed during an FQR initial contact engagement with the customer:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Ask questions that help you better understand the customer&rsquo;s issue.</span></li>
	<li><span>Gather necessary files or reports from the customer.</span></li>
	<li><span>Initiate troubleshooting steps during the FQR engagement.</span></li>
	<li><span>Inform the customer that you have the required data to begin developing a troubleshooting strategy if resolution cannot be provided.</span></li>
	<li><span>Customize communications specific to the customer and their issue regarding the <span>steps in&nbsp;<span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4466241" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>4466241 | Standard Workflow: Index</span></span></span></span></span></a></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span> moving forward and if needed times when you&rsquo;re available to work with them and how to contact you.</span></li>
	<li><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>An index of standard workflows is available in </span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4466241" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>4466241 | Standard Workflow: Index</span></span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>. </span></span></span></span></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>Most workflows are now available on the </span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://www.csssupportwiki.com/" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span><span>CSS Support Wiki</span></span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><span><span>If Scoping via Telephone</span></span></strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Include your scope in your First Quality Response. Otherwise, send the IR email while on the call with the Customer or Partner so that they have your name and contact details.</li>
	<li>Be as detailed as possible when talking with the Customer or Partner, don&#39;t make any assumptions:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>If you have forgotten to ask any question call back immediately, this demonstrates great dedication and service.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>When asking questions:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>If <span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4466241" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>4466241 | Standard Workflow: Index</span></span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span></span> are available check for any specific scoping questions to ask based on the initial case description submitted by the customer or partner during case creation.</li>
		<li>Start with open questions (Who, What, Where, When, Why, Which, How) to enable Customers or Partners to give you as much information as possible.</li>
		<li>Drill into the details by following up with more specific questions (for example, how slow is too slow?).</li>
		<li>Repeat back your understanding of the issue to confirm what you have understood. Practice empathetic listening. Mirror back what you are hearing, paraphrasing your understanding. If appropriate, label the customer&rsquo;s feeling.
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li>For example, &ldquo;Let me see if I have this right. It&rsquo;s doing X, it&rsquo;s doing Y instead of Z, which is making you feel (frustrated/disappointed/angry/unhappy). Do I have that right?&rdquo; Continue until the customer/partner says something like &ldquo;That&rsquo;s right&rdquo;, indicating you both agree and fully understand each other&rsquo;s perspectives on the issue before starting to solve the problem.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>If scoping via Email</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>To deliver First Quality Response follow the First Quality Response (FQR) informational or else follow the initial response procedure to determine whether you should scope in detail or suggest resolution.</li>
	<li>If <span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4466241" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>4466241 | Standard Workflow: Index</span></span></span></span></span></a></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4466241"> </a>are available check for any specific scoping questions to ask based on the initial case description submitted by the customer or partner during case creation.</li>

	<p><strong>PS C:\&gt; $xmlprops = [xml]($ElcProps.MailboxLog)</strong></p>

	<p><strong>PS C:\&gt; $xmlprops.Properties.MailboxTable.Property | where {$_.Name -like &quot;Elc*&quot; -and $_.name -like &quot;*deleted*&quot;} ---&gt; To view item count for items deleted by policy</strong></p>

	<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span><span>A: <strong>First Quality Response</strong> changes the customer experience. Customers come away from their first support interaction feeling Microsoft has someone prepared and knowledgeable, who cares about them, who will quickly help resolve their issue. We want to be prepared, personalize the response, and make progress towards resolution. We strive to reduce the customer&rsquo;s effort. We are not just &ldquo;checking a box&rdquo; and sending non-value-added emails to meet internal measures. It&rsquo;s still important to be responsive to all our customers, based on any premium service offer purchased (e.g., Premier, Unified, Support for Mission Critical, etc.) and case severity. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span><span>A: A quality response is always the preferred response. There are scenarios where we may have to make a judgement call and match the customer&rsquo;s urgency where needed. If a few more minutes of research will enable you deliver a quality response that would move the case towards quicker resolution, you should do that even if it means missing the customer&rsquo;s expected response time by a few minutes. However, if the problem statement is unclear or data is missing, you should go ahead and call the customer. Your first quality response in this scenario is getting clarity on the issue and required data to come up with a solution/next steps for the customer. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

How much time should I spend researching before calling the customer? </span></span></span></strong></span></span></div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span><span>A: Yes. We should still be prepared and personalized in your response but match the customer&rsquo;s urgency. When a customer indicates an issue is critical, they are indicating that responsiveness is most important to them. If you&rsquo;re able to do some research and engage with the customer before the customer&rsquo;s expected initial response time expires, this is the best and desired outcome. If not, call the customer immediately and begin working with them. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

What if the queues are busy or we don&rsquo;t have capacity?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span>A: We want the customer to spend as little time as possible waiting for us, but the added time you spend to prepare for a quality response will benefit them more than calling them unprepared. You should take a couple of minutes to ensure you&rsquo;ve read the information they&rsquo;ve provided, and if appropriate, do some research or investigation, instead of wasting their time on the phone waiting for you to get up to speed on their issue. Never send an IR Templated email, just to meet the customer&rsquo;s expected response time. </span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span><span>A: No. First Contact Resolution is resolving the customer&rsquo;s issue during the first contact. First Quality Response is a new behavior, to engage with the customer in a quality way that includes being prepared, personalizing the response, and progressing the case &ndash; but does not require that the case be resolved in the first interaction. Preparing, personalizing and progressing steps each help reduce the customer&rsquo;s effort to quickly resolve the problem. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span><span>A: No, it changes the when and how you do it. Scoping should be done if it helps clarify the issue. When done right, scoping questions provide quality as part of a First Quality Response and is not sent as a separate &ldquo;Scoping&rdquo; email prior to beginning troubleshooting. Scoping can be done as a verbal agreement on the phone. The focus should, however, be to dig into troubleshooting as quickly as possible and not focused on checking off steps in a workflow. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A: No. Focus on what we will do. We see long emails from our engineers that read almost like legal contracts, describing what we will or will not do. This creates a negative customer experience. Contractual terms are already covered with customers, we do not need to add them in case communications with customers. Keep it simple and be a professional, authentic human, not a robot. We also want to reduce the customer&rsquo;s effort, so if a new case needs to be opened, open the case on the customer&rsquo;s behalf. You could say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be happy to help with that issue &ndash; since it&rsquo;s beyond our original problem, I&rsquo;ll open a second case, which you&rsquo;ll also receive, but I&rsquo;ll take care of that for you.&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A: Yes, managers will assess the quality of <strong>FQR</strong>s and coach engineers based on observed behaviors.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span>A: We absolutely continue to care about overall responsiveness; speed is one of the greatest drivers of CSAT for customers. Initial response is important, as is how long it takes to solve the problem. In addition, we want to ensure we are responding faster to customers who have purchased offers with faster initial response expectations (e.g., SMC, Unified Performance), and cases with higher severities. Responsiveness is not going away with the introduction of FQR. What is going away are bad behaviors, like sending an email solely to meet an internal customer&rsquo;s expected response time metric without preparing or even noticing if you are the right engineer for the case. This behavior will be replaced by genuine engagements with customers. </span></span></span></span></p>
