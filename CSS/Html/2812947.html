	<ol start="1">
		<li><span><span><span>During this time, there is no change to the service for the end users</span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span>In the Microsoft 365 admin center, the subscription will show as &lsquo;expired&rsquo;.</span></span></span></li>
		<li>To avoid a service disruption to their end users, the customer&rsquo;s EA renewal order must be processed 48 hours prior to the end of the grace period.</li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Email notifications are sent to all global and billing administrators on the tenant. No notification will be sent to VL admins(like primary noticing contact or OSM- online service managers) on the day a subscription expires, 14 days from when the subscription will be disabled, and 7 days from when the subscription&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>will be disabled.</span></span></span><br>
		<br>
		<span><span><span><strong>NOTES</strong>:<br>
		- The email notifications are not visible in CMAT or ExploreMS</span></span></span><span> </span><span><span><span>For more info see below email example.

		<span><span><span><span>- Prior to September 2017, online service subscription grace periods and disabled periods could vary by the&nbsp;offer, but this was standardized for simplicity.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>
<span>3. Disabled to Disabled Lifecyclelockout.</span>

<ol class="sbody-alpha_list">
	<li><span>The disabled period, from the grace period end date to when the subscription is de-provisioned, is 30 days.&nbsp; Use the Current Status End Date field in CMAT to determine when the subscription will move from Disabled to its next status.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="text-base">Note</span><span class="text-base">:</span>&nbsp;CMAT will not reflect the Next Status as Disabled:LifecycleLockout. It will show Next Status as De-provisioned. When the subscription is moved to Disabled:LifecycleLockout, the Current Status End Date will be moved out 7 more days. Therefore, you may notice that the Current Status End Date for Next Status: De-provisioned changes by 7 days.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<span>4. Disabled Lifecyclelockout to De-provisioned. </span>

<ol class="sbody-alpha_list">
	<li><span> <strong>After the 30-day disabled period</strong>, <strong>the subscription data will be irrevocably deleted,</strong> if the customer has no other active subscription for the same product<strong>. </strong>If the customer does not want their data to be deleted, they need to renew or call support for an extension.</span></li>
	<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><span> If the customer has purchased a different product in the same family (e.g. they used to own O365 E1 and now they own O365 E3), data for users with the new licenses will not be deleted and the global admin has to reassign the licenses.</span><br>
	<span><span><span><span><span>Use the Current Status End Date field in CMAT to determine when the subscription will move from Disabled Lifecyclelockout to De-provisioned.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>
<span>5. All subscriptions de-provisioned to tenant deletion.</span>

<ol class="sbody-alpha_list">
	<li><span>A tenant with a VL subscription (even when de-provisioned) will never be deleted.<br>
	<br>
	<span class="text-base">Note: </span>Lifecycle information pertaining to a tenant and its subscriptions can only be shared with the Global or Billing Administrators of the tenant.</span></li>
