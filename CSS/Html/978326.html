A 6804 event can be expected because of Active Directory replication timing issues. However, a 6806 event is supposed to be written when the topology fully forms.</div><div class='kb-resolution-section section'>You can safely ignore the Warning event that has event ID 6804 as long as migration to the Prepared state (state &quot;1&quot;) works and as long as the data replicates through DFS Replication without any issues.
