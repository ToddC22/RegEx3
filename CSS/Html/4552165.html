<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How are you ensuring all employees are safe?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> The health and safety of our employees is a top priority at Microsoft. To ensure the safety of our staff around the world, we are diligently following the guidance and updates provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), and are working with local public health authorities in taking the appropriate actions to help protect our employees and community. We are continuing to monitor the spread and impact of COVID-19 and are providing real-time guidance to employees in all affected regions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What protocols are in place to address the impact of COVID-19?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> We have advanced business continuity plans in place to minimize disruptions to our business operations, including those of our customers and partners. These plans include flexible working arrangements for our employees, a comprehensive enterprise business continuity and disaster recovery program, and a global support organization with 24/7 geo-diverse team.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What are some specific measures you are taking to support staff during this time?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> In line with guidance and updates provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as our work with local public health authorities, we are enacting measures broadly and in local markets to provide the necessary support for our colleagues. We continue to provide real-time guidance for employees and take appropriate actions in accordance with the relevant public health guidance.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For example, to protect the health of our employees, we&rsquo;ve reduced campus activity in the Puget Sound and the Bay Area regions and have asked employees who can work remotely to do so. However, we understand that not everyone has a role that can be done from home &mdash; so we have also decided to continue to pay all our vendor hourly service providers their regular pay during this period of reduced service needs. This is independent of whether their full services are needed. This will ensure that, in Puget Sound for example, the 4,500 hourly employees who work in our facilities will continue to receive their regular wages even if their work hours are reduced.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What is Microsoft doing to help communities impacted by COVID-19?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft has partnered with The Seattle Foundation, United Way King County, and other companies to launch the COVID-19 Response Fund. The fund will support community organizations and nonprofits that are on the frontlines of the response. This support will include rental assistance to keep people housed; help ensure children, seniors and families have access to food; and support healthcare workers on the front line.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We are also making an initial $1 million anchor donation to help launch this effort immediately. We are encouraging and facilitate employee donations to support these efforts, which will be matched by the company on a dollar-per-dollar basis.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What is Microsoft&rsquo;s response now that multiple employees have tested positive for COVID-19?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> The health and safety of our employees is a top priority at Microsoft. We are providing real-time guidance to employees in all affected regions. We will continue to monitor the situation and take action as necessary to help protect employees.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For those impacted employees, we are diligently following the guidance and updates provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO), and we are working closely with local public health authorities to provide the necessary support for those colleagues in an effort to minimize any further impact to our employees, customers, and broader community. We will continue to provide real-time guidance for employees and take appropriate actions in accordance with public health guidance.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What changes to </span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span>support should customers expect during COVID-19?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Customers should not expect any changes. We have a business continuity plan in place to provide the same level of support during this period. Our plan is currently active in countries most affected by COVID-19, and so far, we are seeing minimal impact to our operational capacity and our customer experience.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>For <strong>Commercial customers</strong>: If you or your commercial customer has general questions related to CSS&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 that is <em>not addressed by this FAQ</em> and <em>not about specific support incidents</em>, contact your area <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CSS/SitePages/BEM-Contact.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">CSS Business Engagement Manager</a>.

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Business continuity</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How is CSS ensuring business continuity for support?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> For impacted countries, we are rapidly enabling work from home and remote login capabilities for our advocates/support engineers and delivery partners so that they can continue to provide support for our customers. We have also set up daily syncs with our global CSS site leaders to troubleshoot support delivery issues and have backup plans in place for each of our lines of business in case the COVID-19 pandemic spreads.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How are you ensuring that business isn&rsquo;t disrupted across your products and services?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft has a comprehensive service continuity plan to keep our services running smoothly during events such as COVID-19. The plan accounts for increased usage, the ability to remotely manage our services and a geographically diverse engineering workforce to support those services.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Does Microsoft have a Business Continuity Plan, and does it include Pandemic impact?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft has a global, all-hazards approach to its business continuity and crisis management planning. This includes a Pandemic Response Plan that connects to the enterprise response hierarchy.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Is working remotely part of Microsoft&rsquo;s response strategy?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Microsoft&rsquo;s continuity plan comprises multiple impact scenarios and response strategies that provides remote capabilities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How often are Microsoft&rsquo;s business continuity plans validated?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft tests and validates continuity plans based on criticality rating. All plans are required to validate at the level that is relevant to their criticality. All tests must be conducted within 12 months from the previous test or validation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Does Microsoft share copies of its Business Continuity Plans?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft does not share Business Continuity Plans externally.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Are contingency plans in place to ensure all committed support SLAs and recovery time objectives (RTOs) are met?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft utilizes cloud-based call routing technologies which are designed to be highly resilient and route customer calls to alternate locations automatically if any location becomes unavailable ensuring seamless transition of support. Critical support infrastructure is hosted across geo-diverse data centers with load balancing or automatic failover capability.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: In terms of the software services provided to me as a partner, does Microsoft consider COVID-19 a &ldquo;pandemic&rdquo; and a &ldquo;force majeure&rdquo; event?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> (<strong>For partners only</strong>) Currently, we think any such discussions are premature. We are closely monitoring the recent developments regarding the spread of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), and our priority is the safety of our personnel, customers, partners, and community. We will update you as things develop.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Datacenter operations and supply chain</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What is the potential for service impacts? What response plans are in place if there is a regional Azure outage? And how will Microsoft communicate to customers and partners any issue or concerns related to continuity?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>There is no expected impact to Azure services. At this time, all of our datacenters are operating normally. In the unlikely event of an outage, we have standard operating procedures for how we manage service impacting events. There is nothing preventing us from executing against these. We are monitoring the situation closely and taking extra precautions to protect the health of our employees and ensure business continuity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If any cloud services experience a service incident such as an outage, we follow our standard, well-established communications practices to inform impacted customers and partners. This is mainly achieved through the Service Health experience in the Azure portal and/or in the M365 admin center, depending on which services are impacted.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Will the COVID-19 public health situation in China impact datacenter supply chains, might that cause Azure capacity constraints?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>We plan for contingencies including upstream supply chain interruptions, so we are actively working with our supplier base to assess the impact, and to prioritize and expedite available supply where possible to manage and minimize the impact on Azure. We are reviewing the impact of these supply chain factors on our infrastructure capacity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In the rare situations when we do identify capacity constraints for a given region, our first order of priority is always to protect the interests of existing customers and allow them to use Azure the way they need to &ndash; including the ability to grow. Many customers take advantage of Azure so that their applications can expand/contract to respond to demand, so ensuring this &lsquo;breathing room&rsquo; for existing solutions takes precedence over new deployments. In these situations, we work with customers to identify alternative regions and/or alternative resource types.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Will Microsoft&rsquo;s global infrastructure be able to keep up with demand, as organizations around the world encourage remote work?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> We are aware of several large-scale plans by corporations, schools, and even governments to encourage remote work. In line with these plans, we have seen some spikes in usage, but these have been well-within the range of our expected usage volatility.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We continue to monitor usage very closely and are refreshing our demand model assumptions regularly to provide early visibility into any required shifts in planned capacity. As customer plans are fluid, we are proactively working to ensure we are well-positioned to provide the needed support.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>-</span></span></span><span><span><span> Our comprehensive service continuity plan aims to ensure that all our services keep running smoothly, even during events such as COVID-19. The plan accounts for increased usage, enables us to remotely manage our services, and leverages a geographically diverse engineering workforce to support those services.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Where can I get more information?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> If you need additional assistance or guidance around customer messaging, visit </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/AzureCapacity" managed-link="" target="_blank">aka.ms/AzureCapacity</a></span><span><span><span>.

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="4" name="4"></a>4. Education (remote learning)</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How is Microsoft supporting schools/educators considering ongoing closures related to COVID-19?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> The coronavirus has disrupted the daily routines of millions worldwide, including educators and students. Microsoft is committed to supporting administrators, teachers, and students by enabling them to stay connected and engaged through technology. No matter which remote learning tools schools and universities are considering, we are available to answer questions, discuss any institution&rsquo;s online education needs and explore options.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Does Microsoft provide any products or services that can assist educators in light of school closures related to COVID-19?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Yes. For administrators, educators and students facing school closures related to the coronavirus, we offer remote learning solutions like Microsoft Teams for Education. It provides an online classroom so students and teachers can continue to focus on learning. It is <strong>free</strong> for schools and universities and brings together virtual face-to-face connections, assignments, files, and conversations into a single place accessible on either mobile, tablet, PC, or browser.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We offer continuous training and support including webinars and materials purposefully written for school IT, teachers, students, and parents. This includes a remote learning community for schools to connect with each other and Microsoft remote learning and product experts, to share best practices, and get direct support. Teams is also designed to be inclusive and includes the Immersive Reader and keyboard shortcuts for increased accessibility.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How is Surface suited for remote learning?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Microsoft Surface device portfolio empowers remote teaching and learning through optimization of the digital collaboration solutions that Microsoft Education has to offer. Learn more about them at our </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/education/remote-learning" managed-link="" target="_blank">Making the transition to remote learning</a></span><span><span><span> site.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>As some students are learning pronunciation, writing a new language, or working on complex math equations, there are many challenges teachers face when trying to listen and communicate with their students. Using studio microphone arrays, and omni sonic speaker delivering Dolby&reg; Audio&trade;, while also utilizing AI for improved performance of the hardware, Surface devices help every student be heard and understood. The power of the Surface Pen provides a natural writing and inking experience, perfect for working through different math assignments or ideating in a digital whiteboard.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Students in higher education need a versatile machine that can go anywhere, allow them to seamlessly collaborate, and have the horsepower for creative classes in art, design, and engineering, not to mention gaming during study breaks. Microsoft Surface Book has up to 17 hours of battery life, enabling you to stay connected even when a power outlet isn&rsquo;t available. It&rsquo;s optional NVIDIA GE Force GTX, and Intel dual or quad Core processor ensures students have the power they need when tasks get more demanding while video chatting with their study group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How can I, as an education IT administrator, ensure teachers and students are secure when teaching and learning remotely on Surface devices?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Intune for Education and Autopilot with Surface enables students to simply log in to their new Surface device with little or no touch IT involvement. In addition, Microsoft Surface Enterprise Management Mode (SEMM), empowers IT Education Departments to remotely update and manage Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI). And with Surface Device Firmware Configuration Interface (DFCI), in partnership with Windows Autopilot, you can manage all of this from the cloud.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>When devices are enrolled with Windows Autopilot for Surface, IT Education Departments can centrally manage via the cloud firmware settings that can&rsquo;t be bypassed by a password. This ensures students can only access the device for its intended use, without changing settings or operating systems. Surface devices also come preinstalled with Windows Defender from outside threats, anywhere anytime.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What is Microsoft&rsquo;s strategy and capabilities to ensure continued service to government offices?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>We are confident that we will be fully capable of continuing to support the operations of the U.S. Government as an important customer throughout the COVID-19 situation. In accordance with local government recommendations, Microsoft has asked employees in affected areas, such as Puget Sound region, who can work from home to do so. We have sophisticated telecommuting capabilities to enable our employees working remotely to remain effective. In addition, employees who need to perform their responsibilities at the office or in our data centers will continue to do so, and we have arrangements in place for all necessary facilities and other support for them. While we are discouraging non-essential travel, essential travel for operations and customer support will continue. In short, we have a full logistical and support plan in place at this time, and we see no reason at present to doubt our capability to provide support to our customers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How is Microsoft supporting health-care customers in their interactions with their patients during COVID-19?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Health-care professionals play a critical role in supporting the health, safety, and wellness of people around the world. Working in a complex care environment&mdash;made even more complex by events such as the spread of COVID-19&mdash;doctors, nurses, and other health-care staff need access to tools that enable collaborative workflows to deliver high quality patient care. Both patients and clinicians need greater flexibility and convenience when it comes to being able to connect with each other across locations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Does Microsoft provide any products or services that can assist health-care teams deliver care virtually during COVID-19?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Yes, today there are multiple offers being made available for our health-care customers on the frontlines of the COVID-19 response.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Microsoft Teams:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Microsoft Teams enables several capabilities that can assist health-care teams in delivering care virtually and minimizing in facility interactions (where possible).

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Additionally, Microsoft Teams enables simple and secure communication and collaboration with chat, video, voice, and health-care tools in one hub. Health-care organizations can use Teams to manage hospital operations, manage incident response, communicate across the organization around important announcements or urgent messages, and engage via video for remote work.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Microsoft Healthcare Bot:</span></span></span></strong> </span></span><span><a href="https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/microsoft-hcb.microsofthealthcarebot" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Microsoft Healthcare Bot</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> is a first-party Microsoft service available in the Azure Marketplace, providing Conversational AI purpose-built for the health-care industry. The Healthcare Bot (nicknamed HealthBot) is a fully customizable cloud platform designed to empower health-care organizations to build and deploy compliant, AI-powered virtual health assistants and chatbots, that help them improve processes and provide better service.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We already have several customers using HealthBot to support COVID-19 related inquiries. Using our template mechanism, customers can import pre-built scenario flows from a gallery into their HealthBot instance, then easily adjust it specific to their approved protocols and processes using visual design tools.

<h3><a id="7" name="7"></a>7. Remote work (Teams, Security, WVD, Azure)</h3>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What are the key products and solutions customers should utilize when enabling remote work?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>As Microsoft was shifting to remote work given COVID-19, the company&rsquo;s internal IT team, Microsoft Core Services Engineering and Operations (CSEO), executed on a plan to enable: user identity and access, multi-factored authentication (MFA), managed and health-validated devices, productivity applications &ndash; including online meetings, line of business (LOB) access, service monitoring, and more. You can get more details on the </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/?p=234025" managed-link="" target="_blank">M365 and Azure blog post</a></span><span><span><span>, and on the </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/startremotework" managed-link="" target="_blank">field-facing resources site on remote work</a></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What are the resources available to help customers drive end user adoption and change management?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Over the last few years we&rsquo;ve developed a wide range of resources to help customers with driving user adoption and change management.

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How would customers enable access to line of business (LOB) applications?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Most organizations have a number of legacy applications; Microsoft has migrated most of our legacy applications to the cloud. Even with most applications accessible in the cloud, some applications still require VPN. Additionally, we are in the process of rolling out Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD) and are scaling up this offering to further support BYOD scenarios. There is a TAP program for WVD customers can sign-up to, with public preview expected in late April.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Microsoft uses a recovery strategy of working from alternate locations as well as geo-diverse cross-trained personnel depending on the scenario.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Has VPN capacity for remote working been tested?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft infrastructure components are regularly tested to establish and validate recovery capability per Enterprise guidelines and requirements.

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>CISOs and Sec admins need to look urgently at new scenarios and new threat vectors as their organizations become a distributed organization overnight, with less time to make detailed plans or run pilots. Based on our experience we recommend:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Some employees have work assigned laptops, while others use their personal devices to access company data. How can my organization help ensure our network is protected when there are disparate and unassigned personal devices being used for work purposes?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>While it&rsquo;s not uncommon in today&rsquo;s work environment for employees to have work laptops they use at home; it&rsquo;s likely organizations will see an increase in the use of personal devices accessing company data during this time.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Using </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/conditional-access/app-protection-based-conditional-access" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure AD Conditional Access and Microsoft Intune app protection policies</a></span><span><span><span> together helps manage and secure corporate data in approved apps on these personal devices, so employees can remain productive.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Intune, automatically discovers new devices as users connect with them, prompting them to register the device and sign in with their company credentials.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>It&rsquo;s important to remember that employees need a basic understanding of conditional access policies and what their devices need to connect to the corporate network, like up-to-date anti-malware protection. This way employees understand if their access is blocked and how to get the support they need.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/whyappproxy" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure AD Application Proxy</a></span><span><span><span> publishes on-premises apps for remote availability and if you use a managed gateway today we support several partner solutions with </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://aka.ms/secure-hybrid-access" managed-link="" target="_blank">Secure Hybrid Access for Azure AD</a></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: My biggest concern is the short runway we have to get these practices, policies, and tools in place. What can I realistically do now?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>The single best thing you can do to improve security for employees working from home is to turn on MFA. As you probably can&rsquo;t distribute hardware security devices, use Windows Hello biometrics and smartphone authentication apps like Microsoft Authenticator.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Longer term, we recommend sec admins consider a program to find and label the most critical data, like Azure Information Protection, so you can track and audit usage when employees work from home. We must not assume that all networks are secure, or that all employees are in fact, working from home when working remotely.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Also, track your </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/security/mtp/microsoft-secure-score?view=o365-worldwide" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Secure Score</a></span><span><span><span> to see how remote working affects your compliance and risk surface. Use Microsoft Defender ATP to look for attackers masquerading as employees working from home but be aware that access policies looking for changes in user routines may flag legitimate logons from home and coffee shops.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What about guidance for my employees?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Supporting employees will require more than just providing tools and enforcing policies. It will be a combination of tools, transparency, and timeliness.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Warn your employees to expect more phishing attempts, including </span></span></span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/blog/2019/12/02/spear-phishing-campaigns-sharper-than-you-think/" target="_blank"><span><span><span>targeted spear phishing aimed</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> at high profile credentials. Now is a good time to be diligent so watch out for urgent requests that break company policy, use emotive language, and have details that are slightly wrong, and provide guidance on where to report those suspicious messages.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Establishing a clear communications policy, helps employees recognize official messages. For example, video is harder to spoof than email: an official channel like&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://products.office.com/microsoft-stream" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Stream</a>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>could reduce the chance of phishing while making people feel connected. Streaming videos they can view at a convenient time will also help employees juggling personal responsibilities like school closures, or travel schedule changes.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Employee trust is built on transparency. By providing clear and basic information, including how to protect their devices, will help you and employees stay ahead of threats.</span></span></span></span></p>

For more information on how to get started, read </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2020/03/05/our-commitment-to-customers-during-covid-19/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Our Commitment to Customers During COVID-19</a></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How can you assure Teams reliability at this time?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> You and your team depend on our tools to stay connected and get work done. We take that responsibility seriously, and we have a plan in place to make sure services stay up and running during impactful events like this. Our business continuity plan anticipates three types of impacts to the core aspects of the service:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Systems:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> When there&rsquo;s a sudden increase in usage, like the surge we recently saw in China.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Location:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> When there&rsquo;s an unexpected event that is location-specific, such as an earthquake or a powerful storm.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>People:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> When there&rsquo;s an event that may impact the team maintaining the system, like the COVID-19 outbreak in the Puget Sound area.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We&rsquo;ve recently tested service continuity during a usage spike in China. Since January 31<sup>st</sup>, we&rsquo;ve seen a 500 percent increase in Teams meetings, calling, and conferences there, and a 200 percent increase in Teams usage on mobile devices. Despite this usage increase, service has been fluid there throughout the outbreak.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Our approach to delivering a highly available and resilient service centers on the following things:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Active/Active design:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> In Microsoft 365, we are driving towards having all services architected and operated in an active/active design which increases resiliency. This means that there are always multiple instances of a service running that can respond to user requests and that they are hosted in geographically dispersed datacenters.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Reduce incident scope:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> We seek to avoid incidents in the first place, but when they do happen, we strive to limit the scope of all incidents by having multiple instances of each service partitioned off from each other.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Fault isolation:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Just as the services are designed and operated in an active/active fashion and are partitioned off from each other to prevent a failure in one from affecting another, the code base of the service is developed using similar partitioning principles called fault isolation. continuity plan.

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="9" name="9"></a>9. Microsoft Surface</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Does Surface have any offers or programs for customers to help offset the economic impact of COVID-19?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Many of our partners offer leasing programs for devices. Surface devices are available for purchase through authorized resellers as well as through the online Microsoft Store and at Microsoft retail store locations for customers who need to ramp up on device orders to meet employees needs to work from home.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Surface devices like Surface Pro and Surface Laptop are ideal for most working from home scenarios. The high performance of Surface Book allows workers like engineers, finance analysts, research scientists, designers, developers to take many of their critical apps remotely and still collaborate in real time with colleagues across content and data, with both visual and voice communication capability.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How is Surface Hub suited for Remote Workers?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Surface Hub 2S helps bridge the distance between remote team members with a powerful meetings platform. Be seen, be heard, and actively participate leveraging the Surface Hub 2 Camera, far-field mics, crystal clear speakers, and 4K+ resolution screen. Run remote meetings seamlessly with Microsoft Teams or Skype for Business. As mandatory staffing reductions or working from home policies get implemented, critical business functions need to continue, and workers need to be enabled with the best experiences.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The entire Surface portfolio, including Surface Hub 2S, is very effective in scenarios where collaboration is necessary and involves complex business processes. We have customers who use Surface Hub 2S in their factories to connect remote workers directly to the manufacturing line, integrating engineers working together through complex programs. Wherever teams need to iterate live on presentations, video, or other written content, including remote learning scenarios, Surface, together with Microsoft Teams and incredible apps like Microsoft Whiteboard &ndash; lets users collaborate and stay in the flow across different physical locations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How are Surface Go, Pro, Laptop, Book, and Studio suited for remote workers?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Surface devices empower remote workers to participate in remote meetings as if they were there in person without relying on additional peripherals thanks to the built-in high-quality speakers, microphones, and cameras, combined with the power of touch and inking. The entire Surface portfolio offers leading versatility, performance and long battery life enabling people to work comfortably and be as productive as they would be in the office from their sofa, kitchen table, or home office. Our commitment to touch screen and inking with a Surface pen enables workers and students to collaborate and ideate on documents or in whiteboarding sessions as needed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How does Surface help IT Departments manage at home/remote working scenarios both inside and outside Microsoft?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> All Surface devices within Microsoft are now deployed via Windows Autopilot by Microsoft&rsquo;s internal IT team, Core Services Engineering and Operations (CSEO). Windows Autopilot enables a zero-touch deployment for any new Surface device in any environment, to include an employee&rsquo;s home or remote work environment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>This means that users can simply unbox the device (which arrives new in its box) and through the initial setup process Windows Autopilot automatically joins them to Azure Active Directory and enrolls the device into Intune for remote cloud-based management. Autopilot streamlines the shipment of the device, straight to the end-user, without the need for multiple people to physically handle and reimage the device. Microsoft and other companies across the globe are utilizing Windows Autopilot to reduce IT complexity, reduce costs, and streamline remote device deployment through the cloud.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: How can I ensure my employees are secure when working remotely on Surface devices?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Microsoft Surface products are developed with security as a principal focus. Every layer of a Surface device, from firmware to the operating system, through to cloud management, are all serviced by Microsoft through Windows Update. When a threat is identified on a Windows 10 device, at any layer, we proactively push updates to keep customers safe.

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Is it okay to use disinfectant products on my Surface device?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Many common disinfectant products can safely be used on Microsoft Surface devices, namely PDI Sani-Cloth Plus, CaviWipes, Covidien Alcohol Prep Pads, Total Solutions Full Spectrum Disinfectant Wipes, Clorox Healthcare Bleach Germicidal Wipes, and any similar disinfectant wipes with Isopropyl Alcohol (IPA) solution at 70% or less. Users should avoid dousing the device with a solution, but rather use pre-moistened disinfectant wipes or apply IPA to a cloth to clean the device.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>These five options can be used on Surface Go, Surface Pro, Surface Pro X, Surface Book, Surface Studio, Surface Hub, Surface Pen, Silver and Sandstone Surface Laptops, and on all colors of Alcantara fabric, keyboard, and trackpads. Only IPA can be used safely on Black and Cobalt Surface Laptops. Total Solutions Disinfectant wipe and&nbsp;IPA can be used safely on Surface Headphones.

<h3><a id="10" name="10"></a>10. Customer experience centers (EBC/MTC)</h3>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Why is the Executive Briefing Center open when Microsoft has closed the main campus, these actions seem contradictory?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Following local King County government guidance, Microsoft has recommended that Seattle-based employees work from home. However, the main Microsoft campus is not closed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Are the Redmond Executive Briefing Center and Industry Experience Centers open?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Based on customer feedback, we know that our EBC and IEC centers are both a major differentiator and business-critical function for Microsoft. For this reason, we have decided to keep them open for engagements and will continue to assess based on changing circumstances.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: Is there COVID-19 travel guidance I can provide for my guests?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Partners and customers participating in an EBC originate from across the globe and thus are subject to different advisories. Account teams should advise their customers to make travel decisions based on their own circumstances, including their local government and company travel advisories related to the United States. They should consult advisories prior to departure for the latest status.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What type of experience can my customer expect from a virtual engagement?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> To support our customers, the EBC is providing a <strong>Virtual Briefing offering</strong> for engagements already scheduled. These Virtual Briefings will occur over Teams with sessions delivered between 6:00 AM&nbsp;and 7:00 PM&nbsp;(19:00) Pacific Time. These times are provided to accommodate as many sessions and customers across time zones. If you choose the Virtual Briefing option, your briefing engagement team will work with you to adjust your existing agenda, if needed, to have the greatest impact with your customer. We strive to have the same quality experience the account would receive at the EBC by engaging with our leaders and subject matter experts and showcasing the Microsoft Teams solution.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What steps is Microsoft taking to make our guests feel at ease during their EBC engagement?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Both the Redmond EBC and the IEC will offer our full catalog of services for customers as well as transportation and catering. Customer and employee safety is our top concern so the EBC has added additional processes and procedures:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Following all US federal, state, regional, and local government guidelines</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> and implementing best practices from the </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.cdc.gov/" managed-link="" target="_blank">CDC</a></span><span><span><span>, </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public" managed-link="" target="_blank">WHO</a></span><span><span><span>, and the local health department.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Increased sanitization</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> efforts throughout the entire facility, both with regards to sanitizer strength and frequency.

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: (INTERNAL ONLY) I&rsquo;m a speaker at the EBC. Are there any changes I need to be aware of?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> For <strong>engagements where the customer is live at the Redmond EBC and you are based in the Puget Sound region</strong>, we ask for your support in delivering your session in-person per standard procedure. We have deemed the Redmond EBC a business-critical function where it&rsquo;s essential for employees to be onsite. As always, your health and safety take priority, so please speak with your manager if you fall into one of the exceptions categories outlined in Kurt&rsquo;s email or need specific accommodations. We also ask that you email </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:ebcbpm@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">ebcbpm@microsoft.com</a></span><span><span><span> if you fall into one of the exceptions categories or are sick so that we can backfill your speaking engagements. Thank you in advance for your commitment to ensuring our customers have a great experience.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If you reside outside the Puget Sound region and <strong>planned air travel to speak at the EBC</strong>, you may present via Teams.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For <strong>virtual engagements</strong>, you can present via Teams unless otherwise specified (in some cases, teams are presenting from the EBC to ensure quality video, bandwidth).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: (INTERNAL ONLY) Any changes to engagements at the Microsoft Technology Centers? </span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>All MTCs will follow their respective subsidiary guidance on operating procedures. Currently, our Milan, Seoul, Tokyo, and China MTCs are closed for in-person engagements but supporting account teams and customers through virtual delivery of engagements. All other MTCs are operating business as usual and ready to support virtual delivery of engagements if desired by the customer.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: (INTERNAL ONLY) As an account team member, do I need to travel to Redmond to join my customer during their engagement?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> We require a representative from the account team to join their guests on-site at the EBC or IEC.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="11" name="11"></a>11. Microsoft services</h3>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Q: What contract approach can we use with customers seeking emergency assistance when they don&rsquo;t currently have Premier or MCS? Is there a way they can expand a current customer&#39;s contract scope beyond the initial contract?</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>If the customer is not a Premier or Unified Support Services customer, and requires customer support services, the customer can open a support ticket via support.microsoft.com and support will be provided pursuant to our standard support terms at </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4203112/microsoft-customer-support-service-agreement" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4203112/microsoft-customer-support-service-agreement</a></span><span><span><span>. If the customer wants to expand the current scope of their services and Microsoft wants to support such expansion at no cost, Microsoft can enter into a <strong>separate</strong> $0 work order that documents the additional services Microsoft is offering to provide. For example, the Disaster Recovery Team has a quick &ldquo;$0&rdquo; template that they use for delivery of services to public agencies, relief organizations, and commercial entities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="12" name="12"></a>12. Customer service and support</h3>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What changes to support should customers expect during COVID-19?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> We have a business continuity plan in place to provide the same level of support during this period; however, due to increased volumes as more people and organizations switch to remote work, customers may experience longer than normal wait times for certain products and services. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>For commercial customers<em>:</em></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If you or your commercial customer have general questions related to CSS&rsquo;s response to COVID-19 that are not addressed by this FAQ, and are not about specific support incidents, contact your area&rsquo;s </span></span></span><a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/CSS/SitePages/BEM-Contact.aspx" target="_blank"><span><span><span>CSS Business Engagement Manager</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>. They will relay the question to the right support team and get you an answer.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Q: Has the COVID-19 pandemic impacted support wait times?</span></strong> </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Currently, we are seeing an increasing demand from customers who have contacted our support team to help them enable remote work. As a result, we are receiving a high volume of cases, and customers are experiencing longer than normal wait times for Skype and Teams support. If your customer has submitted a case, they will be contacted once a support engineer has been assigned. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Q: Given the influx in volume, how are support cases being prioritized?</span></strong> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> Our customers&rsquo; needs are at the center of our efforts, and we are quickly activating additional measures and people so that we can continue helping organizations everywhere stay connected and productive. As we adapt to best serve all our customers, we are prioritizing first responders, health and emergency management services, and critical government infrastructure organizational use, and ensuring remote workers stay up and running with the core functionality of Skype and Teams. <strong> </strong> </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span>Q: What resources can I provide my customer if Skype/Teams support is not readily available?</span></strong> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>We have several online resources to enable our customers to support their remote workforce. </span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Q: If a customer asks a CSS advocate or support engineer directly how Microsoft is handling the COVID-19 situation, what do we say?</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>In-Store Events, appointments, trainings, etc.</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Any in-store events/appointments/personal trainings that were to occur after March 16<sup>th&nbsp;</sup>have been canceled and cannot be rescheduled at this time. Customers requesting these appointments should be informed that for now these events aren&rsquo;t available for booking and they should check the microsoft.com page for future listings when made available.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>As of now we don&rsquo;t have a date for when in-store events/appointments/trainings will be made available.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Buy-Online-Pick-Up-In-Store (BOPIS)</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Because stores will be closed, all pending BOPIS orders have been canceled and inventory has been pulled to ensure future BOPIS orders cannot be created at this time. This is a temporary measure and more will come as events change. Currently, we don&rsquo;t have a date for when BOPIS orders will be enabled again. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Extended return policies</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>For physical product purchases made via Microsoft Online or Brick &amp; Mortar stores starting February 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020, customers will be able to return the product post 30 days as an exception. For product purchases made in the Microsoft Brick &amp; Mortar store starting February 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020, we will accept in-store returns, with receipt within 30 days of the store reopening. For Microsoft Online Store purchases made starting February 16<sup>th</sup>, 2020, the return label created by customer or CSS within 30-day return window will guarantee the return even post 30 days from purchase date.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Q: The customer asks our advocate or support engineer if they are working from home, what do we say?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Answer truthfully, yes or no. A couple of ways depending on what your situation is:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Yes, I am. Microsoft has issued a mandatory (or voluntary) work from home policy at my site&nbsp;to keep all employees safe and healthy.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>No. Microsoft has not issued a work from home policy at my site because we have not been impacted so far by the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I&#39;m a support</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span> center advocate out of the office due to COVID-19 impacting me or my family, or I&#39;m not able to work from home. Is there guidance on what I should put on my out-of-office message that is sent externally?</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> We recommend first connecting with your manager to ensure your customer inquiries are being forwarded to a colleague. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Use the below out-of-office message template for guidance: </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><em><span><span>&ldquo;Thank you for your message. I am currently out of office, so you </span></span></em><em><span><span>may</span></span></em><em><span><span> experience a delay in response, but please know your message is important to us. </span></span></em></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><em><span><span>If your request is urgent, please reach out to our Support team via our </span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">Support site</a></span><span><span>, or by calling any of our direct global customer service lines.&rdquo;</span></span></em> </span></span></p>
