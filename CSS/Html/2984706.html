<h4><span><span><span><span>1.1 Why is this happening?</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>This happens when too many incorrect passwords were entered consecutively while attempting to sign-in, either by the account owner or someone trying to sign-in to the wrong account. However, this can also be caused by a computer or mobile app that is still using an old password or that needs to use an &ldquo;app password&rdquo;. </span></span></span><br>

<h4><span><strong><span><span><span><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>1.2 How do I fix this?</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>The account will automatically unblock after a short period of time, which can range from one minute or more depending on how frequently sign-in attempts were being made. If this was due to repeated sign-in attempts with bad passwords, use of the correct password or a password reset will resolve this. However, if this was due to an app or device automatically attempting to sign-in with the wrong password, the device or app in question will need to be updated with the right password or an app password before this can be resolved. </span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><strong><span><span><span><a id="2.2" name="2.2"></a></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>2.2 Was Two-step verification recently enabled?</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Check ASD to see if Two-Step Verification is enabled for the account. If it is, ask if Two-Step Verification was recently enabled and if there were any problems signing into to any apps or devices afterward.<br>
<br>
If yes, explain that some aps and devices, like Xbox 360 and older versions of Windows Phone, are not fully compatible with Two-Step Verification and require an &ldquo;App Password&rdquo; to work. While the sign-in screen will usually suggest that you need an app password, this is easy to miss so it&rsquo;s easy for an account to get locked out this way.<br>
<br>
To resolve this, refer the customer to the App Passwords and Two Step Verification FAQ at </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/app-passwords-two-step-verification</a><span><span><span> so they can create an app password for their device or app.</span></span></span></span></p>
