<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. What is Onboarding Consultation?&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Onboarding Consultation is a complementary, introductory service focused on educating and empowering prospective and new to Microsoft Advertising customers as they are getting started with Microsoft Advertising. The service is tailored to assist customers with setting up Microsoft Advertising accounts and campaigns.</p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Program description</h4>

<p><span><span><span>The Onboarding Consultation service includes a single-session phone call with the customer, potentially some tactical work conducted by the advocate after the call and an exit email with relevant resources to conclude the service engagement. There are times when a service engagement may need to be broken out across more than one session because the customer may not have time, or may not be ready, to set up a Microsoft Advertising account and campaign. In these cases, advocates can schedule a follow up call within 5 business days and leave the ticket open during that time. If the follow up call will occur after 5 business days, the advocate should close the initial ticket and open a new one.<br>
<br>
Customers receive the Onboarding Consultation service by calling a special phone number that routes to the services team, by setting an appointment using the SMB Scheduling Tool (for new to Microsoft Advertising customers) or by receiving a phone call from a services advocate.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>For all other markets, if a prospective or new to Microsoft Advertising customer calls for help getting started with Microsoft Advertising but reaches a support advocate, that support advocate should assist the customer accordingly and code the ticket under the program of &nbsp;Standard Support.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If a prospective or new to Microsoft Advertising customer contacts standard support and asks to speak with a specific services advocate, explicitly requests the Onboarding Consultation service or the customer has an open SR where the Service Program field equals Onboarding Consultation, warm-transfer the case to the services team.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Attempt to transfer to the initial advocate, if possible. If that is not an option, attempt to reach an available advocate on the services team.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If no one on the services team is available, confirm the customer&rsquo;s phone number, ask if they prefer to be contacted in the morning or afternoon, notate the service ticket with the customer&rsquo;s call-back preferences, then set expectations with the customer that a services advocate has been notified and will get back to them as soon as possible.</span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span>The account&rsquo;s QBR penalty or business model prohibits it from serving in the action.</span></span></span></span></li>

<div align="center"><span> </span></div>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>As you pitch the Onboarding Consultation service offering to customers, you may hear objections. This is normal. Effectively addressing objections may turn a disinterested prospect into an enthusiastic customer who is receptive to receiving your assistance getting started with Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Here are some example objections you may hear with suggested responses to get customers more interested in your service offer:</span></span></span></span></p>
