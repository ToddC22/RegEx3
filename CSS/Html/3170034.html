<h3><span><span><span><span><span>What is this article about?</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>This article describes the requirements and steps for setting up monthly invoices. Monthly invoice billing is a post-pay payment method available only to qualified advertisers. Qualified advertisers are issued an SAP ID to be used as the payment method in the account and will need to complete insertion orders to enable ad delivery (see KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3175371" target="_blank">3175371 Process: Microsoft Advertising: Insertion Orders</a> for more information). </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div align="center"><span><span> </span></span></div>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This process should be used for new SAP setup requests and changes to existing credit lines that require a secondary assessment of risk (for example, credit limit increase or sold-to conversion to bill-to). Other minor administrative changes like address or accounts payable contacts may go directly to </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Global Financial Services (GFS), also known as Worldwide Online Credit Services (WOCS), </span></span></span></span><span><span><span>and do not require a Customer Setup Form.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Before getting started, ensure the customer is properly fortified (or manually authenticated by establishing contact with the requestor via the email domain or phone number published on the advertiser&rsquo;s website).<strong> </strong>This will help to ensure the requestor is not using legitimate business information to establish a fraudulent credit line.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Important: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>If additional documentation is required for the customer to proceed with credit approval, use KB </span></span></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4056786" target="_blank"><span><span><span>4056786 Microsoft Advertising: Data Transfer Management</span></span></span></a><span><span><span> to securely acquire sensitive customer information, such as financial statements.</span></span></span></span></p>

Supported currencies for Invoice Billing:</span></span></span></strong><br>
<span><span><span>Monthly invoicing is not supported for all currencies, and the currencies that are accepted differ depending on the billing center the advertiser is aligned to. See&nbsp;<a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50828/3" target="_blank">Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising</a>&nbsp;to ensure the customer can be billed on monthly invoice in their preferred currency.<br>
<br>
<strong>If advertiser&rsquo;s currency isn&rsquo;t supported:</strong><br>
Share the messaging&nbsp;below and assist with setup of prepay or threshold billing.<br>
<br>
&ldquo;<em>We don&#39;t currently support monthly invoicing for your desired currency. I can help you set up a threshold or prepay account to get you started or we can explore other currencies in which monthly invoicing is possible.&rdquo;</em><br>
<br>
<strong>﻿Supported payment types for Invoice Billing:</strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Payment options for invoice customers vary by market. The invoices generated at the close of each billing cycle will specify market-specific payment remittance options and instructions and should align with the banking destinations listed for each billing country/currency combination in </span></span></span><a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/50828/3" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Choosing a payment method for Microsoft Advertising</span></span></span></a><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Paying invoices via check has largely been deprecated.

<strong><a id="section 2.1.1" name="section 2.1.1"></a>2.1.1 Net terms </strong><br>
Standard net terms for the US and Canada are Net 30 days for direct advertisers and Net 60 days for agencies. Standard net terms for other countries vary (see table below).<br>
<br>
As of 2015, all unmanaged advertisers must have standard net terms. If the advertiser sends you a modified version of the IO where any information has been changed, let the customer know we only accept standard net terms and cannot change the language of the terms and conditions of the IO.</span></span></span></span></span><br>
The form is sent to GFS (also known as WOCS) for review and approval by the Senior Credit Manager or Director of Credit and Collections.</p>

			<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Corporation -</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Owned by shareholders who each put an amount of money into a central pool.

			<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Sole Proprietor -</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Simplest and most common type of small business.

</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A Sole Proprietor is a business that is owned and run by one person in which there is no legal distinction between the person and the business. Businesses that fall under this category have more requirements to qualify for invoice billing. </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Sole Proprietors can self-identify or you can determine look up their business on the market-specific government website listed<span> </span></span></span></span></span><a href="https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/p/v-anaba/EVnbebi2WGhPgvJaxNVJmKcBjNJmmWyeeldZ1mgWTQsMuw?e=9Fj6eN" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span>here</span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>.

As a best practice, always suggest credit cards as a payment method for Sole Proprietors. If they insist on invoice billing, they will be required to pay a deposit matching the amount that they are requesting for a credit line. The minimum is $1K USD. For the entire time they are advertising with Microsoft Advertising, Microsoft will retain this deposit. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>An insertion order is a signed document or electronic setting submitted on behalf of or by the advertiser that specifies how much the account can spend over a designated time frame. Microsoft Advertising will not allow spend beyond the IO budget or end date.</span></span></span>　</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Electronic IO (eIO)</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
Electronic IOs are the fastest method for creating an insertion order. Only Super Admin and API User roles can perform this action. The customer must be listed as the Bill-to party on the account. See&nbsp;<a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/52094/0" target="_blank">How do I create and edit an insertion order?</a>&nbsp;for customer-facing steps to create and manage insertion orders.<br>
Customer eIOs, in general, will be auto-approved. A small subset of IOs may still require manual approval from an internal user and will continue to be subject to manual approval SLAs.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Manual IO</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
If the advertiser is unable or unwilling to submit an eIO, frontline advocates&nbsp;may request BOS generate the manual Insertion Orders: submit the request through a child ticket to BOS if needed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>BOS should draft and attach the manual IOs that can be delivered to the customer.</span></span></span></span></span><br>
Advertisers should complete and scan the signed documents and return them via&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4056786/data-transfer-management/t_self" target="_blank">Data Transfer Management</a>&nbsp;in a non-editable format such as PDF. See KB&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4056786" target="_blank">4056786 Microsoft Advertising: Data Transfer Management</a>.<br>
<br>
<span><span><span><span><span>After receiving the completed IO from the advertiser, perform a quality check of the Insertion Order using the checklist below. Request the advertiser fix and resubmit any errors as needed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Non-standard terms/IOs are <strong>not</strong> supported for unmanaged customers. If the customer sends you a modified version of the IO where any language has been changed, let the customer know that we only accept standard IOs.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Beginning February 2020, the requirement for SAP Sold-To will&nbsp;refer to ABL details. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Application for an SAP ID&rsquo;s going forward are based on Bill-To information only.</p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Subsidiary SAPs: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>SAP IDs are created for unique Company Name + Address combinations; therefore, subsidiaries may have their own SAP ID even if the Bill-To address is the same as the parent. Subsidiary SAP IDs can be established if there is some public identifier that the subsidiary legally exists.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Agency SAPs:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If an agency would like to create an additional account under their shell for themselves and already has an existing No Hold SAP ID, the agency&#39;s existing No Hold SAP ID may be used as the Sold-To if the SAP address matches the account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Monthly invoices are generated and available as PDFs in the UI by the second</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;of each month and are sent via postal mail afterward (for those accounts not enrolled in paperless invoicing).

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you or advertisers have questions about invoices or payments that have been made, refer the customer to the regional customer service alias on their invoices or escalate the ticket via their regional </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>GFS (</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>also known as WOCS) </span></span></span><span><span><span>Collections team in UCMT.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Credit memos: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>A credit memo is a document generated at the end of a billing cycle because of an activity adjustment on a monthly invoice account. The Monthly invoice for the period will still reflect the full amount of spend generated and the advertiser will need to specify in their payment remittance, how they would like the credit memo (with document ID) to be used against unpaid invoices.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Steps to re-render an invoice</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Navigate to the <strong>Microsoft Advertising</strong><strong> Internal Support Dashboard</strong> which is the default page for internal login.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>If you are already logged in to Microsoft Advertising on another tab (such as <strong>Campaigns</strong> or <strong>Accounts &amp; Billing</strong>), you can select the gear/settings icon in the top right-hand corner of the screen where you see your alias/email and select <strong>Support</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Copy the invoice number for the specific invoice to be re-rendered.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Make sure to check the <strong>Payment Method</strong> so the address is correct.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>In the <strong>Tools </strong>section, select <strong>Documents Rendering. </strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The default <strong>Billing system</strong> is AdCenter. Do not change this.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>In the <strong>Document number</strong> field, paste the invoice number to be re-rendered. This is a required field.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>In the <strong>Account number</strong>, enter in the XID from the invoice. This is a required field.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>6. Select<strong> Re-render</strong>. This will re-render the invoice with any updated information pulled in from Microsoft Advertising and the billing systems (SAP). The re-rendered invoice will open as a PDF file and should show the updated/corrected customer information. The document now replaces the previous instance of this invoice on the <strong>Billing</strong> tab.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>7. Provide the updated invoice to your customer. You can either:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Send your customer the updated document via email.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Let them know the version on the Microsoft Advertising UI is updated and available for their use.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>All credit lines will be reviewed at the time of customer notification to determine if a customer is eligible for a credit limit increase. Customers with consecutive months of successful payments made in full and on time are more likely to be eligible for these courtesy increases.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer continues to receive notification that they&#39;re nearing their credit limit, it means that it&#39;s unlikely they are eligible for an increase and must pay to avoid going dark. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>An email will be generated to the customer and there will also be a critical alert surfaced in UCM when:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customer is going to hit credit limit in (approximately) 14 days or less.</span></span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The 14-day estimate is based on the advertiser&rsquo;s current run rate. A run rate is calculated by the average daily spend over the past seven&nbsp;days.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="9.3" name="9.3"></a>9.3 Monthly invoice payment applied, account still on hold</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If payment has been collected and the account is current, the credit hold should typically be lifted within two&nbsp;business days of receipt of payment. However, GFS (also known as WOCS) regularly assesses customers risk level and reserves the right to review and refine SAP invoicing eligibility at any time.<br>
<br>
If the credit hold has not been lifted after payment is received, gather and submit payment details (for example, payment amount, when and how it was sent, or how they want it applied) to the regional Collections team in UCMT to confirm that the payment has been received and if the hold has been lifted. If the hold has been lifted by the accounts receivable team but persists in the Microsoft Advertising UI, escalate to Global Support for further assistance.<br>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em>Can you send me a copy of the check you sent or the transaction number from your online statement? I will check with our billing department to ensure the payment was received and that your account hold will be lifted.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>When a customer does not pay, it&#39;s possible their debt will be written off after a certain amount of time. These debts may show as &#39;paid&#39; in the UI, even though they were not paid by the advertiser, thus the credit hold will persist. If a credit hold persists unexpectedly and the customer desires to use the same (invoice) or new payment method, contact the appropriate </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>GFS (</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>also known as WOCS)</span></span></span><span><span><span> Risk team to request the following:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Define the customers intentions (to pay an old/outstanding debt, to lift SAP hold, to lift CID hold to allow use of another payment option).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Request itemized details of outstanding debt.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span><span>GFS (</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>also known as WOCS) </span></span></span><span><span><span>Risk teams should facilitate internal transfer of tickets to their appropriate teams (for example, Risk or Credit) when necessary. However, if you find there is not adequate traction around a hold being lifted, you can add the escalation alias: MSAHOLD@microsoft.com.</span></span></span></span></p>
