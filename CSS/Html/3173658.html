<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Bing Shopping campaigns</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Bing Shopping campaigns let&nbsp;advertisers run Product Ads on Bing and Yahoo in the US and Bing for other markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Product Ads showcase retail advertisers&rsquo; products by letting them display an image, price, merchant name, product details, and shipping costs&nbsp;(DE only). Product Ads from Bing Shopping campaigns are displayed when a searcher enters terms in Bing that are relevant to products in an advertiser&rsquo;s Bing Merchant Center store.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span asset="4012919" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4012919]</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Product ads can display in the sidebar and mainline of the search result page. Up to eight Product Ads can be displayed.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Can show a Text Ad and a Product Ads from the same merchant</li>
		<li>Can show two or more Product Ads from the same merchant</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Promotional text is displayed when search users roll their curser over the ad.</li>
	<li>When a product ad is clicked on, search users are linked to the advertiser&rsquo;s website where they can purchase the product.</li>
	<li>Clicks on product ads are charged on a cost per click basis.</li>
</ul>

<div>Advertisers can set up dedicated shopping campaigns for specific types of products by targeting certain product attributes, as defined by Product Groups.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>The more specific the product targets are, the more control the advertiser has on which product serves.</div>

<h4><a id="4.2" name="4.2"></a>4.2 Campaign management&nbsp;features</h4>

<p>Bing Shopping campaigns offer several features that streamline campaign management and give better access to campaign insights:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div><span>Campaign </span>priority&nbsp;- Set your campaign priority to give a specific, timely campaign preference despite bid amounts. This only compares campaign priorities of the same store and won&rsquo;t help regarding competitors&rsquo; campaigns.</div>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<div><span>Example: If one of the products you sell is flip flops, you can set the priority for the campaign that features your flips flops to &ldquo;High&rdquo; during the summer to boost the likelihood that it will show compared to your other campaigns. Once fall hits, you can keep running the campaign, but shift its priority back to its default (low).&nbsp;</span></div>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>One ad within an ad group -&nbsp;</span><span>Write your promotional copy once and use it for a whole ad group.</span></li>
	<li><span>Product groups replace product targets</span><span> -&nbsp;</span><span>A streamlined hierarchal structure organizes automatic Product Groups, so each group has a unique set of offers &mdash; meaning complete product coverage without overlaps.</span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Target individual offer values/attributes - Define narrower Product Groups with up to seven filters &mdash; as opposed to the three filters that can be used with Product Targets. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Insights into Number of Products Matching - View how many products are being targeted by your BSC campaigns with respect to your overall Products in the Bing Merchant Store. Under the Product Groups tab, four columns can be manually added to the Product Group grid</span></span></span></span>:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Total number of products submitted - This is what the advertiser submitted in BMC&#8203;.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Total number of products ready to serve - This is what is received from Product Ads offline (before campaign filters are applied).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Number of products targeted - The number of products matching the Product Group condition&#8203;.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Percent of products targeted - Percent of products matching the Product Group condition.</span></span></span></span><span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>New feed elements - New custom labels, plus Bing category, and merchant-defined Product Type.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Google Shopping feed data - Can be easily imported to use with Bing Shopping campaigns</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Agencies can create and manage Bing Merchant Center stores on behalf of their clients under a single Microsoft account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>To manage client stores, the agency must ensure that:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The client&rsquo;s domain has been claimed in Bing Webmaster Tools (the agency can do this on behalf of the client).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The agency has a Microsoft account that&rsquo;s listed as a user for the client&rsquo;s domain in Bing Webmaster Tools.</li>
</ul>

<p>To set up a client store, the agency must first log in to its own Microsoft Advertising agency shell, and then navigate to the appropriate sub-account for the client whose store it would like to create or manage.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Agencies will be able to see all of a client&rsquo;s Bing Merchant Center stores that have been created at any point, even those that they do not have permission to manage and those that were previously created under a different Microsoft account.</li>
	<li>Agencies cannot see which client account they are working in from within Bing Merchant Center. To verify the sub-account, the agency must return to the Microsoft Advertising UI.</li>
	<li>If an agency creates a store for a client with a non-available market billing address, it will not trigger manual review because the system checks the agency&rsquo;s country and billing address, not the client&rsquo;s. Agencies should not be creating stores for non-available market clients at this time.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A store created by an agency is still owned by the client.</li>

<h4><a id="5.7" name="5.7"></a>5.7 API functionality</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Advertisers should consider using the Content API if the feed includes many products and are able to integrate the Content API with the rest of their inventory management systems. Customers who are currently using the Google Content API will be able to adapt their code to use the Microsoft Advertising Content API easily.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customers with smaller product feeds, or a limited ability to integrate with their inventory systems, may be better off using the simpler FTP method.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customers will not be able to use FTP/automatic download/manual upload and the content API simultaneously. Once a merchant account has been migrated to use the Content API, the advertiser will not be able to submit to their product feed via any of the three available methods in the UPI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>For information on Product Ads in the API, see <span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/advertising/shopping-content/index?redirectedfrom=MSDN" target="_blank">Content API Overview</a>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="5.8" name="5.8"></a>5.8 Content API for Product Ads catalog management</h4>

<p>For advertisers who want to manage their Bing Shopping ads to reflect real time market conditions, Content API provides a programmatic way to manage product offers (insert, update, delete and read) and provide a mechanism for the advertiser to provide faster pricing and availability information to reflect relevant and up-to-date product information in the ad.</p>

<p>Key points and value propositions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Allows merchants/retailers to programmatically insert, update, read, and delete product offers instead of managing data feeds through FTP.</li>
	<li>Provides support for faster availability and pricing updates for product offers to reflect real time market conditions.</li>
	<li>Allows advertiser to update product details incrementally rather than uploading entire data feed.</li>
	<li>Accepts Google PLA format which minimizes engineering friction for merchants/retailers to switch from competition.</li>
	<li>Is a REST service that supports both legacy creds (username, pwd) and OAuth (MS account) for authentication.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Supports E2E SLA of &le; 36 hours for new offers and &le; 3 hours for pricing and availability updates.</li>
	<li>Is a RESTful API (not SOAP based), that uses standard HTTP GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations to access data on the server.&nbsp;Note that a default catalog cannot be deleted.</li>
	<li>Supports batching multiple operations into a single HTTP request.</li>
	<li>Entries in dry-run mode do not affect live data so you can use dry-run mode to verify that your feed will not generate any unexpected warnings or errors before modifying your live feed data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Content API requests should be sent to https://{prefix}.content.api.bingads.microsoft.com and {prefix} should be replaced with the prefix value you were issued during API provisioning.</p>

<p><span>There are now two different ways to set up BMC stores. Advertisers can either verify and claim their store website&rsquo;s URL through a Bing Webmaster Tool process, or they can create a BMC store simply by adding UET tags to their website, allowing for a faster store setup experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4><a id="6.1" name="6.1"></a>6.1 Create BMC store with UET tag</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising customers can create a BMC store by adding UET tags to their website.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Criteria:</p>

<ul>
	<li>At least 50 UET events must be fired within the last 30 days.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>In the Create a Store workflow, under Store Info, the advertiser must check the &ldquo;Use UET tag to populate the above destination URL&rdquo; box (see screenshot below). If a new UET tag was added and 50 events were fired from the website, it can take up to 48 hours for the domain destination URL to appear in BMC.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Automated checks will be performed to verify the UET tags are associated with the customer registered in the system. The domain(s) will only show up in BMC if there is a match.<br>

<p>There are three ways to verify ownership of your site:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>XML Authentication</strong></li>
</ul>

<ol start="1">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>BingSiteAuth.xml</strong> to save the custom XML file, which contains your customized ownership verification code, to your computer, and then upload the file to the root directory of the registered site.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Using the FTP site type FTP here and hit enter. It would prompt for a username and password and then you can just copy and paste the feed file into File Explorer</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Place an XML file on your web server.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Verify the ownership.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the file, save it, find it saved as BingSiteAuth(1) web browsers like Firefox and Chrome and IE will sometimes add parentheses or an X to the filename, if there is already a file on there.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li align="LEFT" class="indent-1">Adding a meta tag to the header is useful for users that are unable to upload files, but they can modify the HTML. You must&nbsp;be able to access some sort of UI or platform to add an HTML tag, and there are many different service providers.</li>

<h4><a id="6.3" name="6.3"></a>6.3 Google Import</h4>

<p>Importing your campaigns is recommended for advertisers currently using Google Shopping campaigns.</p>

<div>Things to remember:</div>

<ul>
	<li>Set up your Bing Merchant Center first. Uploading your product feed to the Bing Merchant Center can take up to 48 hours for the feed to process. Use the same feed as you&rsquo;re using for Google Shopping campaigns. No changes are needed to your Bing Merchant Center store.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Importing your Google Shopping campaigns into Microsoft Advertising only imports your campaign structure &ndash; not your product feed itself, which you upload to the Bing Merchant Center (see above).</li>
	<li>Be sure to set your campaign priority. Set the priority of your imported campaign to medium or high priority.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<div>Import your Google Shopping campaign:</div>

<p><span><a bookmark-id="" data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51050/0" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51050/0</a></span></p>

<p>After import, go to <strong>Campaign Settings</strong> to ensure the campaign is linked correctly to your Bing Merchant Center store.&nbsp; Also remember to check your import summary log for any errors.</p>

<p>Recommendation: Start with a few Bing Shopping campaigns. Once you&rsquo;re satisfied with your set up and have started seeing performance data, import your remaining shopping campaigns from Google.</p>

<div><strong>Note</strong>: Extensions must be added manually.</div>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="7" name="7"></a>7. Aggregator store review process</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p>When a Bing Shopping advertiser is impacted by store rejections, evaluate whether they are an aggregator by using the criteria outlined below. If they are an aggregator, follow the process below to escalate the appeal and provide guidance.</p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="7.1" name="7.1"></a>7.1 How to identify Shopping Aggregators</h4>

<p><span><span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>A &ldquo;true&rdquo; aggregator/shopping comparison website shows products from <strong>many</strong> different website stores. The website allows the user to search for products and returns curated products based on the criteria they&rsquo;ve set. A website that has fewer than three stores, or one that does not really let a user search for products is <strong>not</strong> an aggregator and should not be approved to be an aggregator.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Here are some examples of aggregator websites</span></span></span></span>:</p>

<p><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.bizrate.com/womens-shoes/blue/1162-1586/buy" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://www.bizrate.com/womens-shoes/blue/1162-1586/buy</a><br>
<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.shopzilla.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://www.shopzilla.com/</a><br>
<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.shopping.com/Hush-Puppies-shoes/products?CLT=RSH&amp;KW=Hush+Puppies+shoes" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://www.shopping.com/Hush-Puppies-shoes/products?CLT=RSH&amp;KW=Hush+Puppies+shoes</a><br>
<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.leguide.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://www.leguide.com/</a><br>
<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.bhg.com/shop/houzz-m.html" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://www.bhg.com/shop/houzz-m.html</a></p>

<p>If&nbsp;you review these websites, you can see how they let users search, sort, and filter based on their criteria. The information displayed on the sites should be true, display the&nbsp;<strong>actual seller</strong>, and redirect to the seller&rsquo;s website if a user clicks on the product. It should not create poor user experiences such as excessive popups</p>

<p>Aggregators will most likely contact support because their&nbsp;<strong>store is rejected </strong>(not offers)&nbsp;due to no valid products or product redirection.</p>

<p>Ask the customer the following questions to determine whether they are an aggregator or not:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you sell products directly on your website?&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>If YES, then they are <strong>not</strong> an aggregator. Get an example product URL, verify, and submit a store rejection appeal as usual.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If NO, then they might be an aggregator. Ask the follow-up question: &ldquo;Do you run a shopping comparison site?&rdquo; </span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span>If the answer to this question is YES, then they <strong>are</strong> an aggregator. Follow the process below to submit an aggregator appeal.</span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not sure, escalate to Ad Platform &amp; Tools (refer to the<a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/StandardSupport/l1resources/Lists/Escalation%20Guide?viewpath=%2Fteams%2FStandardSupport%2Fl1resources%2FLists%2FEscalation%20Guide" target="_blank">&nbsp;Escalation Guide</a>&nbsp;for Sub-Team details) for an appeal and request guidance as to whether the customer is an aggregator or not.</p>

	<li><span><span><span>The review team will respond letting you know whether the store has been approved as an aggregator store.</span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><strong>If approved, inform the customer that they must adhere to the <strong>aggregator specific feed rules.</strong></strong></span></span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">

<h4><a id="9.1" name="9.1"></a>9.1 Best practices:&nbsp;Product feed</h4>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div>Go beyond the required attributes. Populate your feed with as many recommended attributes as possible for each product offer.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>The more information you make available, the more likely your Product Ads will be shown for relevant searches.</div>
	</li>
	<li>
	<div>Use the custom labels for Bing Shopping campaigns.&nbsp;These will help you group your products and better target.&nbsp;For example, by best sellers, high margin products, items with high/low return or spend, or even by seasonal event.&nbsp;</div>
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="indent-1"><strong>Use a descriptive title for your product.</strong></div>

<div>
<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Include all relevant information possible in your title.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">One &ndash; 255-character limit.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Add relevant search terms that will trigger your product queries.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Include brand and product type in the title. If applicable, add the gender, size, and color.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Include &ldquo;Product Type,&rdquo; a recommended attribute.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Include your own product type or category for product.&nbsp;This will help you break out your campaigns more granularly.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Include &ldquo;Microsoft Advertising Redirect,&rdquo; a recommended attribute.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Include your destination URL for dynamic tracking parameters.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">This link redirect attribute will allow the advertiser to add third-party tracking and ensure that tracking parameters won&rsquo;t fall off when links are redirected.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Include &ldquo;Conditions,&rdquo; a recommended attribute.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Include the product&rsquo;s condition: New, used, or refurbished. This can help you show a wider range of products that match searcher intent.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Use a high-resolution image for the image link (product image URL).</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Use images with a white background to make them pop.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Do not include any text within your images (for example., promotional messaging like &ldquo;save now for spring&rdquo;).</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Image size must be at least 220x220.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Test different images of the same product to determine which image performs best.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Include your own product type or category for product.&nbsp;This will help you break out your campaigns more granularly.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Refresh your feed weekly.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Your feed must be uploaded at least once every 30 days or the feed will expire.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>We recommend a weekly refresh at the minimum, but daily refresh is optimal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>Refresh your feed when there are any changes with your inventory. For example, items become out of stock or are back in stock, prices change, discounts or sales are in effect, or you offer new items.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><span lang="EN"></span></strong><a id="9.2" name="9.2"></a>9.2 Best practices: Campaigns<strong><span lang="EN"></span></strong></h4>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Create new campaigns for your Bing Shopping campaigns.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Instead of adding Bing Shopping Campaigns to existing campaigns, create new campaigns to ensure that performance statistics for each can be isolated.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Create at least one campaign that targets all products in the feed.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">This gives advertisers the ability to continually gain insights about products in the feed that may deserve attention but aren&rsquo;t currently captured by other product groups.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Test different titles, images, and the granularity of product targets.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Include all relevant information possible in your title (255-character limit).</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Add relevant search terms that will trigger your product queries.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Include brand and product type in the title. If applicable, add the gender, size, and color.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Use the product tracking destination URL for dynamic tracking.</strong></p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Target specific products in your feed.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Beyond the &lsquo;all-inclusive product&rsquo; target, include specific brands, product types, or individual products that align with your business goals.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Use negative keywords</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Use negative keywords to prevent your products from showing in response to irrelevant or poor-performing searches.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Get as granular as possible with the category levels &ndash; categorize products at the lowest categorical level, and adjust your bids based on the item.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>For example, <strong>Apparel &amp; Accessories</strong> &gt; <strong>Clothing</strong> &gt; <strong>Pants</strong> &gt; <strong>Jeans</strong>&gt; <strong>Item ID</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>First broken out by top category level (Apparel &amp; Accessories), then drilled to the 4th category level (Jeans), then broken out by ID level to target top selling items and increase their bids to achieve top positioning.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>Excluded &ldquo;All Products&rdquo; as this campaign focuses only on jeans. This &ldquo;All Products&rdquo; target should live in your main Bing Shopping Campaign, but always have an All Products group active. The more granular you get, the higher you should bid.</span></span></span></span><span><span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Use custom labels within your campaign to better target.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">If you use custom labels in your product feed for best sellers, high margin products, items with high/low return on ad spend, or even by seasonal event, you can then target by these in your campaign.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Use campaign priority settings to indicate which of your campaigns should serve with priority over others.</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Use campaign priority settings to have your top campaigns serve ahead of your non-performing campaigns by setting them to &ldquo;High&rdquo; priority.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>If a Bing Shopping campaign is set at &ldquo;Low&rdquo; priority, the campaign with the highest bid will serve.</span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Low &ndash; the default setting for regular Bing Product Ads.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Medium &ndash; Will serve Bing Shopping campaigns over standard Product Ads campaigns.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>High &ndash; Will serve over your standard Product Ads campaigns and any Bing Shopping campaigns that are set at medium</span></span></span></span>.</li>

<h4><a id="9.3" name="9.3"></a>9.3 Best practices: Performance tracking&nbsp;</h4>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Routinely monitor performance</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>Regularly monitor Bing Shopping campaign performance through the UI, campaign report, and product group reports.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Use the Shopping report to monitor performance of individual items.</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>This report found in the Dimensions tab can prove useful in optimizations &ndash; identifying which IDs are costing you without converting or converting well with a positive return.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Use Share of Voice (SOV) reporting for CPC, CTR, and impressions.</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>The SOV report is designed to help you identify the source and impact of lost impression share compared to competing ads in the marketplace and to provide only estimated impressions and click shares to help optimize your campaigns. It doesn&#39;t show exact delivery performance, but it does show records data if there is significant marketplace participation. The insights can be useful for bidding and positioning.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Use the search term report to negate and search terms you may deem irrelevant to your Bing Shopping campaigns.</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>Look at corresponding search negative terms within your search campaigns and use them for your BSC negatives.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Initially, allocate a similar budget for your Bing Shopping campaigns as you would to keywords for the same products.</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>Some advertisers have found success allocating 30% of their total budget to Product Ads is a good starting point.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Set your initial Product Group bids equal to or greater than similar Text Ad bids.</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>When new keywords are introduced into the marketplace for Text Ads, they need to have a high enough cost-per-click to be shown. Product Ads need the same.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Set bid adjustments for smartphone and tablet audiences</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>To reach mobile audiences, advertisers should modify their bid boosts for smartphone and tablet devices (from -100% to +100%), from within the campaign UI</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Product Ads are only available in the United States for PCs, tablets, and smartphones, and in the United Kingdom and Australia for PCs and tablets</span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span class="rangySelectionBoundary" id="selectionBoundary_1487023570779_2642291581635395"><a id="10" name="10"></a>﻿10.&nbsp;</span>FAQ</h3>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Could a Text Ad and a Product Ad for the same product, and from the same advertiser, serve at the same time?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Relevance and bid will determine what ads we show for Text or Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns. It&rsquo;s possible that both ad types, from the same advertiser, for the same product, will be displayed at the same time. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns be associated at the ad-group level?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns can be associated at the campaign and ad group level. Users will associate their store at campaign level, then any ad groups created under that campaign will be associated with that same store. The hierarchy is just like Text Ads &ndash; for example, ad group settings trump campaign settings. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What are the differences between Search Ads and Product Ads?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><strong><span><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>Search Ads use keywords for ads to be triggered while Product Ads don&rsquo;t.</span></span></span></span><br>
<br>
<span asset="4012926" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;half&quot;}" unselectable="on">4012926</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br>
Product Ads from Bing Shopping campaigns are displayed when a searcher enters terms in Bing that are relevant to products in an advertiser&rsquo;s Bing Merchant Center store.</p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Is there a way to move a Bing Shopping campaign to the top position?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>All ads will have a starting of sidebar 4 &ndash; that is, position 4, but this is the best spot.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Average position is no longer a modifiable setting in the UI grids (was driving support volume), but this may still be listed in the reports.</span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If asked, let a customer know that this position isn&rsquo;t an issue.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Unlike Text Ads which do better at the top, studies show that the position in sidebars deliver similar click-through rates for product ads.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>What makes a difference for click-through rates are: Price, seller name, and title. For example, a known store or name brand will do better than unknown brands.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Are Bing Shopping campaigns similar to what other search advertising platforms offer?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong>They are similar to the Google Shopping campaigns with a few variances in feed files, but they are not like Amazon&rsquo;s Product Ads. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can I use my Google- import file?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes. Bing Merchant Center supports the use of Google data feeds for catalog feed files. This way merchants won&rsquo;t have to redo the work already done for Google&rsquo;s product listing ads.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: We are a small business and use an external checkout option. Is this OK?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes. It&rsquo;s common for small businesses to use external checkouts, and sometimes this is the safer option for shoppers. If the checkout is secure, and all personal consumer information entered on the site (such as account creation and billing information) is SSL protected, this should be OK.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Are Bing Shopping campaigns available to non-retail advertisers?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong></strong></span></span><span><span><strong></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns will only serve for queries that have &ldquo;commercial intent&rdquo; (such as, &ldquo;Canon Rebel&rdquo;). Thus, only real ads from retail advertisers with product offers will serve. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What is the cost for Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Product Ads works on a pay per click model. While you bid on keywords for Text Ads, for Product Ads, you will instead bid on specific products and their attributes within a Bing Shopping campaign.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Should we reduce spend on Text Ads (for products) if we use Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>The two will have different costs per click, different click-through rates and different conversion rates. We provide reporting that enables advertisers to make the appropriate decisions about where to assign their advertising dollars.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Is geo-targeting or device targeting available?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Geo-targeting within the US is available. Desktop, tablet, and mobile targeting are also currently available through bid adjustments. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What&rsquo;s the mobile experience like for Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Product Ads are now showing up on hi-fi mobile phones (Android and iOS only) in the US to increase advertiser clicks and their marketing reach across devices. Customers cannot choose to opt in or out of this, but they can modify their bid boost for mobile device (from -100% to +100%) from within the campaign UI. Three Product Ads will serve at the top of the page with or without Text Ads.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Could a Text Ad and a Product Ad for the same product, and from the same advertiser, serve at the same time?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>It&rsquo;s possible that a Text Ad and a Product Ad from the same advertiser for the same product will be displayed at the same time. Relevance and bid will determine what ads we show for Text or Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can I set different bids on different product groups?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>You can set and assign bids for different product groups. Groups can be defined using various elements/filters, such as brand, product category, or SKU.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What information will be displayed in the links/images?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> For Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns, the following elements will be displayed as a part of the ad copy: Product title or description, a product image, promotion text (45 characters, via hover-over) and price.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can I export Bing Shopping campaigns?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Yes.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Will I be able to set different bids on the Product Groups (formerly Product Targets)?</strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>You can set bids on different product groups. Product groups can be defined using various elements or filters, such as brand, product category, or SKU.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Can you filter by SKU or MPID (For example SKUs 0-100 or MPID&rsquo;s 100-200)?</strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>You can filter at the Item ID level, not SKUs. To filter for a group of item IDs, you can use a custom filtering field.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Is there a way to exclude products using negative keywords?</strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes. Advertisers should use negative keywords to exclude products.<br>
<br>
<strong>Q: Do I need to enter promotional text to create an ad?</strong></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Promotional text is not required. You can leave the field blank and move on to create your product groups. When you select <strong>Save</strong>, a Product Ad will be created without promotional text.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Is there a way to have better keyword targeting in our feeds?<br>
A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>This is located within the UI as the Search Term report. If you have a Bing Shopping campaign, specify this and you will see search queries and the product groups they are matching to. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can we exclude products/categories within an &quot;all products&quot; group? </span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes, you can exclude product groups or sub-categories in the UI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What if we have over 20,000 products? Would you still suggest targeting Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns at the product level? </span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> With the way product groups are structured in Bing Shopping campaigns, offers not covered in specific product group filters are still covered in each of the main hierarchical product sections unless they are specifically excluded. For example, if an &ldquo;All Products&rdquo; product group was created, and specific subgroups were created (for example, Apparel &amp; Accessories), other products not included within the specifically bidded subgroups will be included in an &ldquo;Everything else&rdquo; grouping, which ensures 100% coverage of all offers (unless specifically excluded).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Does accelerated delivery work with Bing Shopping campaigns? </span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes. Bing Shopping campaigns follow the same budget settings as regular search campaigns. In the campaign settings, you can also set priority (low/medium/high) for campaigns to appear, regardless of your bid amount.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: When will we be able to use comma separated values for product labels? </span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>This is not available in the current Bing Shopping campaign experience. Custom labels are single value fields both on Google and on Bing.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Will Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns appear in certain ad positions only (for example, mainline or sidebar)?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns may appear in the mainline or sidebar positions alongside other Product Ads.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Google won&rsquo;t serve a PLA unless there are three advertisers who are offering the product. Does this happen with Bing Shopping campaigns?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> No, not at this time, but this is being considered for the future.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How do Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns interact with other search ads? For example, what&rsquo;s the impact on Rich Ads in search or ads with Sitelink Extensions?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Product Ads coexist with other ad formats on the search results page and thereby generate incremental visibility for advertisers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Will advertisers be able to bid on brand or item ID with Bing Shopping campaigns?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes, advertisers can continue to bid on brand and item ID.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: If a merchant is not physically in an available market, but sells products or has a presence in the US, can they use Product Ads or Bing Shopping campaigns?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If merchant is not physically located in the United States, the merchant can still qualify for &ldquo;having a presence in an available market&rdquo; as long as they meet all of the following criteria:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: If a catalog&#39;s feed setting is set to automatic, and the advertiser uploads another feed before the first feed goes live, will the first feed be preempted by the newly-loaded feed?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><strong><span><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span> No. Needs are processed as they come. Both feeds would be processed in the order they were received</span></span></span></span>.</p>

<strong>Reporting and tracking FAQ</strong></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can I see how many products are being targeted by my Bing Shopping campaigns with respect to my overall products in the Bing Merchant Store?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Yes, the Product Match Count report will provide this information. Columns supported in the report are: Campaign ID, Campaign Name, Ad Group ID, Ad Group Name, Number of Products Matched (one row per campaign and ad group), and Total Number of Products Submitted at the Store Level.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How will the KW performance report work with Bing Shopping campaigns data?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The KW performance report is not applicable to Bing Shopping campaigns. The Product Target Report (which is similar to the KW performance report) is specifically intended to provide Bing Shopping campaign data at the start of the Beta.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What performance reports are available for Bing Shopping campaigns?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Performance reporting is available at the product group and offer-level under Microsoft Advertising standard reports. The reports will reflect changes of the performance of the offers/products currently within each product group.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Is there a report that tells me how many offers are displaying?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Yes, the Publishing Report is available under the Catalog Management tab for your store. You can also check this in the Products tab within the shopping campaigns. This will give you an amount of products associated with the campaign.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How do I assess average position metrics for Product Ads in Bing Shopping campaigns? </span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> We currently do not have average position reporting capabilities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Where are the Product Ads-specific search query report located for Bing Shopping campaigns? </span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>You can use the standard search query report, and just filter by your Bing Shopping campaigns. If you are having trouble, reach out to your Account Manager.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Is there a way to add revenue to the reports or the UI? </span></span></span></strong> </span></span><span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> We&rsquo;re investigating how to accommodate this once this product releases.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can we view conversion data at the Product Group level?</span></span></span></strong></span></span><strong><span><span><span><span><br>
A:</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span> You can add the conversion data columns when you&rsquo;re defining your Product Group report</span></span></span></span>.</p>
