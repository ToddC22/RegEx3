<p><strong><span><span>What is this article about?</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>This article provides the information about <strong>support boundaries for Commercial Tech Routers (Cloud and On-Premises).</strong></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span>Commercial Support is divided into <strong>On-Premises Tech Support </strong>and <strong>Cloud Tech Support</strong>. Determining whether the customer&rsquo;s scenario is supported by On-premises Tech Routers or Cloud Tech Routers is different. Below article shows how to recognize proper support boundaries and direct/support the customer appropriately.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>There is a difference between Technical Support team and Technical Routers. Tech Routers are a front desk for customers, and they are responsible for routing them properly to receive technical assistance from engineers (i.e. they can create a technical case, that will be managed by Technical Support engineer or refer customers to the website, where they can create a case themselves). </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Tech Router Team is available only via phone (customer has to choose the phone number based on his country of origin from the list available here: </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/4051701/global-customer-service-phone-numbers</a><span><span>) </span></span></p>

<h2><a name="_Commercial_On-Premises_Tech"></a>Commercial On-Premises Tech Support</h2>

<p><span><span>Commercial On-Premises Tech Support department supports <strong>business </strong>customers having issues related to products purchased under <strong>Volume Licensing </strong>agreements, <strong>server software</strong> or products working in the <strong>company network</strong> (<strong>server domain</strong> or <strong>local network of more than 10 PC&rsquo;s</strong>).</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>On-Premises Tech Routers have also the possibility to assist customers having problems with activation or simply asking for activation of the software not associated to any account. The table below shows the examples of </span></span><a href="#_PA_scenarios_for"><span><span>Product Activation scenarios in and out of scope for Commercial On-Premises Tech Routers</span></span></a><span><span>. </span></span>The tools they are using are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Service Desk - for tracking purposes, contracts entitlement (Software Assurance, Access ID check) and case creation,</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>PACSR Tool &ndash; activation of the products for customers,</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Key Information Tool (KIT) &ndash; troubleshooting activation issues.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="_Commercial_Cloud_Tech"></a>Commercial Cloud Tech Support</h2>

<p><span><span>Cloud Tech Support supports technical issues of customers who purchased <strong>commercial license of Office 365</strong> (see list of available plans on </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://products.office.com/en-gb/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://products.office.com/en-gb/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2</a><span><span>), <strong>Dynamics 365</strong> or <strong>Intune</strong>. Products such as Office 365 Personal, Office 365 Home and Office 365 University are <strong>out of scope </strong>for Cloud Tech Routers. These issues are supported using:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Rave &ndash; customer&nbsp;entitlement and case creation,</span></span></li>
</ul>
<h2><a id="support boundaries" name="support boundaries"></a>On-Premises Tech Support Boundaries</h2>

<p><span><span>To determine, whether the customer falls under the scope of Commercial Tech Support, advocate should gather the following information:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Is customer a home user or business user? (company, MS Partner, MSDN/VSS subscriber)</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>If customer is a home user, one additional thing must be checked:</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Not all the questions below need to be asked with every customer. The type of question(s) and the order of asking them varies by the way customer explains his issue and by customer&rsquo;s scenario itself</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Is customer&rsquo;s issue related to technical problems with <strong>MS Access, Visio or Project</strong>?</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>If yes, this software is considered as <strong>a business software</strong>, irrespective customer&rsquo;s type, therefore customer should be supported by <strong>Commercial </strong>team.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If not, advocate should continue to investigate:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Is customer&rsquo;s operating system or office application software is installed on a standalone PC?</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Issues related to software installed on a standalone PC are <strong>out of Commercial Tech Support scope</strong> (except technical issues with <strong>MS Access, Visio and Project</strong>).</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Is customer&rsquo;s operating system or office application software is installed on a computer connected to a domain or server?</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>All technical issues with software installed on a device connected to server network are <strong>in scope for Commercial Tech Support.</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Is customer&rsquo;s computer connected to the network 10 or more PC&#39;s? </span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Local network of more than 10 PC&rsquo;s is typical for the companies, therefore such scenario is <strong>in scope for Commercial Tech Support.</strong> Issues on a computer running in a local network of less than 10 PC&rsquo;s<strong> are out of scope for Commercial Tech Support.</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>What is the customer&rsquo;s license type? (OEM, FPP, Volume Licensing, Visual Studio Subscription)</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Products purchased under Volume Licensing Agreements and Developer subscriptions are always supported by Commercial Tech Support. For OEM and Retail only if the product is installed on a computer connected to a server network or local network of more than 10 PC&rsquo;s.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>What is the customer&rsquo;s issue?</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>On-Premises Tech Routers are handling only technical issues within their scope. Questions related to billing or questions before purchase (license terms, functionalities etc.) should be handled by proper departments.</span></span></span></p>

<h2>Cloud Tech Support Boundaries</h2>

<p><span><span>To determine, whether the customer has a business plan of Office 365, an advocate can confirm the following:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Name of Office 365 plan customer is using</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>All Office 365 commercial plans mentioned here: </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://products.office.com/en-gb/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://products.office.com/en-gb/compare-all-microsoft-office-products?tab=2</a><span><span> <strong>are supported by Cloud Tech Routers.</strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Customer&rsquo;s login/domain type</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Commercial subscribers of Online Services are not using public domains (i.e. gmail.com, Hotmail.com, yahoo.com, outlook.com). The only exception is customer with 1 license of Microsoft 365 Apps for business plan, which can be assigned to an individual account, but still handled by Commercial Support. In other cases, public domains are strictly related to <strong>Microsoft Account </strong>and <strong>Office 365 Home, Personal </strong>or<strong> University</strong>, hence they are <strong>out of scope for Cloud Tech Support. </strong>Typical commercial domain of Office 365 ends with .<em>onmicrosoft.com </em>or <em>.company.com</em>, i.e. <em>contoso.onmicrosoft.com, contoso.com</em>. Such accounts are supported by Commercial support.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Customer&rsquo;s issue</span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Commercial Cloud Technical Support supports issues related to <strong>Online Services </strong>and <strong>Online Services synchronized with On-Premises, </strong>and also <strong>activation </strong>and <strong>installation </strong>of Office 365 Commercial suites (where applicable). Billing issues, subscription management and other types of technical issues are supported by appropriate teams.</span></span></p>
