<h3><span><span><u>Policy and Process</u></span></span></h3>

<p><span><em><span>Indirect EA customers purchase Azure Enterprise Agreements through a Microsoft Channel Partner (aka EA Partner for our purposes).<span>&nbsp; </span></span>EA partners are responsible for providing pricing information and billing support to their indirect EA customers.<span>&nbsp;When EA partners logon to WAPEP, they will able to see information about indirect customers assoicated with them.&nbsp;</span>EA Partners have a slightly different view in the WAPEP and also some restrictions compared to direct EA customers.<span>&nbsp; </span></em></span></p>

<p><span></span><span>The experience on WAPEP will differ from that of Indirect Customers and Direct Customers in that they will not have any Account or Subscription creation/management abilities.<span> </span>It will be limited to viewing and downloading information for their enrollments.<span> </span></span><span>For other issues not highlighted here, please follow the process from existing EA TSGs.</span></p>

<p><span>Following is a description of the links in the Left Nav:</span></p>

<ul>

</ul>

<p><span>Q:<span>&nbsp; </span>Can a partner access an enrollment if the customer has not yet activated it?<span>&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span>Yes.<span>&nbsp; </span>It should be available in the Partner List.</span></p>

<p><span>Q: An EA Partner contacts support stating they are not able to see one of their indirect customer enrollment or usable information. How&nbsp;do we&nbsp;assist in&nbsp;this scenario? </span></p>

<p><span>If this is for a new indirect customer enrollment, it could be a problem with the&nbsp;EA Contract Set up. Please&nbsp;refer to <a href="/en-us/help/2658541" target="" title="">Azure Support - EA <span id="#h1">Troubleshooting</span> <span id="#h2">Contract</span> <span id="#h3">Setup</span></a>&nbsp;for troubleshooting steps.&nbsp;Indirect EA customers&nbsp;could also&nbsp;have switched their assoicated partner.&nbsp;We called this a Change of Channel Partner event (CoCP). Data past the CoCP effective date will no longer be visible to the orginal partner.&nbsp;The enrollment will only be visible to this partner for 120 days.&nbsp;Please do not disclose any information related to this enrollment to this partner especially who is the new partner assoicated in the record.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>Note: CoCP is done on the backend.&nbsp;</span><span>Ther<span>e is no FAS involvement.</span></span></p>

<p><span>Q: How do I tell which</span>&nbsp;partner<span> is assoicated with an indirect customer?</span></p>

<p><span>The partner name is listed on the Manage Accounts page as shown below:</span></p>
