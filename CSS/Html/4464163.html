<p><strong><span>What is Swarming?</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Swarming is a method of collaborating &nbsp;in real time with engineers in the relevant technology.

<p><strong>When to Use Swarming?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Engineers should try to solve customer problems themselves, but when they get stuck or want to validate an action plan to speed up resolution, we want a culture where it&#39;s encouraged to ask for help.</li>
	<li>Swarming can be used before first contact with the customer to support <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464166"><span><span>First Quality Response</span></span></a>, or at any point during troubleshooting to collaborate with engineers, either within the same technology area, or across technology areas.</li>

<p><strong>When to Swarm or Collaborate ? </strong></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Swarming is a form of collaboration that enables a faster and smoother customer experience. By scoping, engineers can quickly bring the right technical skills into the customer conversation and immediately continue troubleshooting. Swarming should be the default method of collaborating as it provides a better customer experience when compared to the standard collaboration procedure.</span></span></span></p>

<p>If swarming does not enable real time collaboration with engineers in the relevant technology, or that technology is not enabled for cross-technology swarming, then see collaboration procedure. <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4346610">&nbsp;4346610 Procedure: Collaboration</a></p>

<ol>
	<li>Identify best swarming method
	<ol>
		<li>Where possible, make use of local engineer relationships to find the correct skillset to help progress the case.</li>
		<li><span>Where you need to contact a remote resource to request assistance, try to use available Teams channel and ask your question so that any SME could respond.</span></li>
		<li>If help is required within your technology area, then make use of correct swarming Teams channels.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If swarming using Teams:
	<ol>
		<li><span>Start a new post to the most appropriate swarming channel. This initial post should include: </span> <span> </span>
		<ol>
			<li><span>Case number.</span></li>
			<li><span>Technology required.</span></li>
			<li><span>Description of the question or customer issue.</span></li>
			<li><span>Expectation of SME &ndash; e.g. quick question, discussion via IM, or engage on customer call.</span></li>
			<li><span>Example: &quot;Case 12345678 Surface deployment advice needed &ndash; how to manage local admin passwords for a large deployment. Customer on Phone. &quot;</span></li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Wait for a response from an SME in the relevant technology. If you are actively working with a customer, then continue to troubleshoot as best you can.</li>
		<li>If an SME responds in Teams:
		<ol>
			<li>Initiate technical discussion with the SME, utilizing the Teams post, a direct message, phone or in-person.</li>
			<li>Request the SME to join a customer call if it will help to progress the case.</li>
			<li>If there is ongoing work and the SME is available to remain engaged in the case via swarming, then dispatch a collaboration request to the SME in the case management tools.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>If there is no response in Teams:
		<ol>
			<li><span><span><span><span><span>If there is no response to the swarming request then it can help to @ mention the channel name to get attention from SMEs, or to @ mention an individual who is a Swarming Champ or SME for the technology area. For example, &ldquo;@Anu &ndash; do you know who may know about this?&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></li>
			<li>After waiting for a response and continuing to troubleshoot with the customer, you may determine that the best experience for the customer is to disengage from the customer while waiting for a swarming response.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>If you disengage with the customer then you should respond with a status on the Teams post, setting expectation for timeline to re-engage with the customer. For example, &quot;Disengaged with customer, who would like response by tomorrow morning EST.&quot;</li>
			<li>If there continues to be no response to the swarming request, then you may determine that the best way to progress the case is to respond to the Teams post stating that you are creating a collaboration request in the case management tool. Make use of the <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4346610">4346610 Procedure: Collaboration</a> to create a request.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If responding to a swarming request as SME:
	<ol>
		<li>Be aware of the expectations from the engineer requesting swarming. Only engage if you have the availability to engage in the case as requested.</li>
		<li>Where possible, balance workload of existing cases to allow answering swarming requests in Teams.</li>
		<li>Work with the engineer utilizing the Teams post, a direct message, phone or in-person.</li>
		<li>Where relevant, make the engineer requesting swarming assistance aware of shift hours or time constraints.</li>
		<li>If responding to a swarming request in a Teams Channel.
		<ol>
			<li>Be clear in responses to Teams Channels where accepting responsibility to respond to a swarming request, to minimize duplication by other SMEs.</li>
			<li>&quot;@ mention&quot; the swarming requestor&#39;s name in your replies to be sure they receive Teams notifications of your response.</li>
			<li>For quick questions, reply with answers directly to the post in the Teams Channel.</li>
			<li>For larger requests reply to the post in the Teams Channel to accept responsibility and then separately contact the requestor.</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>Notes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each Channel in Teams that is used for Swarming should have a Swarming Champ assigned to help encourage adoption and drive engagement to respond to swarming requests in the swarming Channel.</li>
	<li>Engineers who act as SMEs or Swarming Champs should favourite the Channels that match their technical skills so they will receive notifications of new swarming requests. Channels can be added to favorites by clicking the star next to the Channel name.</li>
	<li>Customer PII should never be posted in Teams.</li>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span>A: Depending on the situation:</span></span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If you have an active case with an immediate customer need then do chase up the swarming request explaining the customer impact.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If no resource is available, consider if you have reached out to the correct business area, and if using a different method of swarming (e.g. Teams or in-person) may help progress the case quicker.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span>If a team is not yet officially configured for cross-group swarming, that does not change the value proposition of swarming.&nbsp; Leverage your professional network to try to locate a local or remote person who can engage.&nbsp; If you are not able to locate someone who can engage immediately, then follow the published process for sending a collaboration work item.</span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span>A: When handing over case ownership it should ideally be a warm handover to someone who has already been involved in the swarm. </span></span>&nbsp;<span><span>For planned absences, the new owner should be fully ramped up on the issue and formally introduced to the customer ahead of time.&nbsp; For unplanned OOF, having clear, concise case notes with all outstanding actions pending on the customer and on Microsoft are critical to ensuring we maintain progress in a manner that does not disrupt the customer&#39;s sense and expectation of progression.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span>A: Whenever possible, particularly for critical case, it&rsquo;s preferred to complete the case with the customer. When this is not possible, if another person in the swarm is remaining on shift and can continue to work with the customer, have them do so.&nbsp; If not, if the case is urgent, conduct a warm handoff with another engineer in your technology in a later time zone, and have any swarmers continue with the new owner.&nbsp; If the case is not urgent, see if the customer can wait until you return to continue, or conduct a warm transfer of the case to another engineer in a later time zone who can see the case through to completion.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span>A: In an ideal scenario each person engaged in a swarm will remain available as long as their participation is necessary to progress the customer case to a solution.&nbsp; In circumstances where expertise is in demand from a swarm member who is not available, a replacement should be found.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span>A: Swarming requests should make it clear what level of involvement is desired.

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span>A: Swarming in person where possible is the preferred option as it gives the best experience for customers and better allows for working at the customer&rsquo;s level of urgency. Where you don&rsquo;t have the ability to swarm in person you may have access to Teams channels for contacting engineers across different technologies. Work with your manager, Swarming Champ or Swarming Lead to find out more.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Access to Teams channels for cross-technology swarming will be expanded after full swarming deployment.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span>A: Swarming doesn&rsquo;t change how engineers should use case management tools. When swarming directly with an individual or with other engineers within your technology, swarming is a mechanism to get the right skills involved quickly. Normal processes should be followed to track case activities. This is also true for cross-technology swarming with engineers who may be in different case management tools, standard documented processes for tracking case activities should be followed.</span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: Collaboration is when one engineer requests another engineer with a different skillset to help solve a customer issue. When implemented through current case management tools, collaboration requires dispatching an object to a queue.</p>

<p>Swarming is a method of collaboration that enables multiple engineers with different skill sets to work together as a virtual-team, established in real time, to solve a customer issue.</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: Swarming should be the preferred method of collaboration for all situations where there is a live customer issue and a customer waiting for resolution. Swarming enables a shift in Microsoft support where customers don&rsquo;t need to wait for the right engineer to be found, but instead engineers with the right skillset are engaged in real-time to immediately continue solving the customer issue.</p>
