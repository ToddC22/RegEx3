<p>Rarely, a situation arises during a support or service contact that is unusual and may&nbsp;not involve a Microsoft Advertising product. These may include various threats,&nbsp;and irate or abusive behavior.</p>

<p>The policies and procedures for handling such situations are outlined in this article. Note that these procedures have been verified by Microsoft and should be followed carefully and exactly for legal reasons.</p>

<p><em>Note: When instructed to record a phone conversation below, you may be unable to do so based on your call center setup. In such cases, take detailed notes describing the conversation. Remember to mark the time of the call. </em></p>

<h3>Legal threats&nbsp;<a id="LegalThreats" name="LegalThreats"></a></h3>

	<li>Be understanding and patient.</li>
	<li>Do not offer any contact information for Microsoft Legal Department unless the contact requests it.</li>
	<li><strong>Do not </strong>discuss legal liability or wrong doing by Microsoft.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Real-time legal threats&nbsp;<a id="RealTimeLegalThreats" name="RealTimeLegalThreats"></a><strong><a class="ms-asset-internalBookmark" id="#K" title="#K"></a></strong></h4>

<ol>
	<li>Ask the contact to describe the issue. Focus on resolving any problems that concern Microsoft Advertising tools and features.</li>
	<li>Work with the contact to resolve the issue without referring to legal action.</li>

Do not promise any kind of follow up)</strong>:<br>
	<br>
	Microsoft Legal Department<br>
	One Microsoft Way<br>

<h4>Escalating the call&nbsp;<a id="EscalateCall" name="EscalateCall"></a></h4>

<p><span>&nbsp;If the caller asks to speak with a manager at the start of the call/chat, use the following scripting: </span></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<div>&nbsp;&quot;I can contact my manager for you. However, if you are willing, I might be able to help you.&quot;</div>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span>If the caller asks for the manager again, escalate the call. Never refuse to escalate a caller to a manager.</span></p>

<h4>Ending the call/chat</h4>

<p>End the call if the caller displays the following behavior:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li><span>The caller continues to be unprofessional after three warnings that the call will be discontinued if unprofessional behavior persists. To warn the caller, use the following scripting: </span><span>&quot;This call must remain professional. If you cannot keep this on a professional level, I will have to end the call.&rdquo; </span></li>
	<li><span>The caller continues to be abusive. </span></li>
	<li><span>The caller is upset to the point of being irrational. </span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>Before you disconnect a call, use the following scripting: </span><em>&ldquo;I am going to end this call now. I would very much like to help you. But you insist on being unprofessional. Please call back when you are willing to work with us. Thank you for calling Bing Support.&quot;</em></p>

<h4>Blocking abusive customers over chat</h4>

<p>If the customer continues the abusive behavior after three warnings and the chat is ended as a result, the agent can escalate to a SME or L2 to block the customer from future chats.<br>
<br>
<span>Blocking can be done in LiveEngage by clicking on the &#39;survey&#39; tab, and selecting &#39;yes&#39; to &#39;block future chat sessions&#39;. L1 agents should always escalate to a SME or L2 before implementing the block.</span></p>

<h4><a class="ms-asset-internalBookmark" id="#R" title="#R"></a>Disconnected call&nbsp;<a id="disconnectedcall" name="disconnectedcall"></a></h4>

<p>If either you or the contact is unintentionally disconnected during a phone call, follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Wait 3-5 seconds for a response.</li>
	<li>Ask whether there is anyone on the line.</li>
	<li>Wait 3-5 seconds for a response.</li>
	<li>Again ask whether there is anyone on the line.</li>
	<li>Wait 3-5 seconds for a response. If there is still no answer or if you hear a busy signal, end the call.</li>
</ol>

<p>Support team members should log (in the service request) that the call was unintentionally disconnected. Also, describe the troubleshooting stage reached before the call ended.</p>
