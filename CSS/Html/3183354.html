<h3><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Targeting allows advertisers to get their ads in front of the customers that align to their target market by adjusting the following targets:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Language, physical location, and location intent</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Days of the week</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Time of the day</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Age and gender</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Device used (desktops/laptops and tablets, or smartphones)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Website or IP address exclusions</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>LinkedIn</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Targeting is an excellent way to make ads more effective. For example, if an advertiser knows which gender is more likely to be interested in an ad, they can target the ad so that either males or females are more likely to see it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Similarly, if your product is meant for an audience in a certain geographic location, or for an audience that is online at specific hours of the day, advertisers can use targets to show the ad only in certain places or at certain times. They can also target searchers by location, regardless of the country where the site they visit is published.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Targeting can be set at the campaign or ad group level. Targeting set at the ad group level will override targeting at the campaign level only if the same target type is present at both levels. This will help serve ads to your most relevant audiences.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3>2. Cost and effect on ad position</h3>
<a id="header1" title="header1"></a>

<h3><a id="CostandEffect" title="CostandEffect"></a></h3>

<h4><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1 Cost</h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Advertisers decide how much to bid for targets. If they&rsquo;re using incremental bidding, each target that they add to a keyword requires an additional (incremental) bid.</span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Remember that the base bid always applies. For example, if an advertiser places a base bid of 10 cents and bids an additional 100 percent for a certain target, 20 cents is the maximum amount that they would pay for an ad to be shown when the target is matched. The advertiser only pays enough to beat the person who is positioned under them. In this example, the amount an advertiser pays could be any amount between five cents and the full 20 cents, depending on the other factors that affect positioning, including how much other people bid on the keyword and the target, as well as relevance and click-through rate.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Incremental bids are additive. For example, with a base bid of 10 cents and an additional bid of 100% on Tuesdays and 100% on males, if a male search user selects&nbsp;the ad on Tuesday, the advertiser may pay up to 30 cents for that click: 10-cent base bid + 100% Tuesdays (10 cents) + 100% Males (10 cents).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>If the ad is shown to users who do not match the target criteria, and they click on the ad, the advertiser does not pay any part of the additional targeting bid. The advertiser only pays the base bid</span></span></span></span>.</p>

<h4><a id="2.2" name="2.2"></a>2.2 Effect on ad position</h4>

<p>Adding targets to keywords might improve an ad&#39;s position. With incremental bids, they are added to the keyword bid. The total bid amount will be higher with those incremental bids than without. Generally, the higher the total bid amount, the higher the ad&#39;s position online.</p>

<h3><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. Geographical location targeting <a id="GeographicalLocationTargeting" title="GeographicalLocationTargeting"></a></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Geographical (GEO) targeting in Microsoft Advertising helps advertisers expand their reach to find new customers and home in on their perfect customers on Microsoft Advertising.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Advertisers can target campaigns and ad groups to customers by physical location and search query location intent. Advertisers can also choose to bid higher on keywords matched to customers in their targeted geographical area. Geographical targeting is sometimes referred to as regional targeting, location-based targeting, geo-targeting, and demo targeting.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">When advertisers target by location, they can choose to show ads to potential customers in specific countries/regions, states/provinces, metro areas (or Nielsen Designated Market Areas (DMAs) in the US), zip codes/post codes, counties, or cities.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Advertisers in any market can target ZIP/post codes in locations offering this targeting option, even if their own market does not support this form of targeting. </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Zip/Post code targeting</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> is available in: AU, CA, DE, FR, UK, US</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>City level targeting</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span> is supported in: AU, CA, FR, UK, US &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Advertisers can set both geo/area and radius targeting entries for the same campaign or ad group for greater control and flexibility.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>In addition, advertisers can target campaigns by excluding specific physical locations. This feature is especially useful for advertisers with specific geographic areas to which they don&rsquo;t ship or provide services. They can also use it to offer targeted special promotions. Advertisers can retain location exclusions when importing campaigns from Google. For example, if they&rsquo;ve targeted the United States but excluded some states, those exclusions will be supported when they import their campaigns.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Advertisers can also use language and location options to reach users in multiple countries who speak the same language.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="6.1" name="6.1"></a>6.1 How geo-targeting works <a id="HowGeoTargetingWorks" title="HowGeoTargetingWorks"></a></h4>

<ul>
	<li><span lang="EN-GB">Microsoft Advertising applies geo-targeting based on a reverse-IP lookup of each user:</span></li>
	<li><span lang="EN-GB">The IP address of a user is based on how that user accesses the Internet. </span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span lang="EN-GB">Geo-targeting may not be accurate in the following situations: </span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:square">
			<li><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Private network</span></strong><span lang="EN-GB">: The user accesses the Internet through a private network. The user sees ads that are not targeted by location because Microsoft Advertising cannot apply geo-targeting to an unknown address. </span></li>
			<li><span lang="EN-GB">Corporate Network: The user accesses the Internet from a different location. For example, corporations frequently map all their IP addresses to a single location. Frequently, the actual location of all the users on a corporate network is not reflected in their IP address.</span></li>
			<li><strong><span lang="EN-GB">IP mapping</span></strong><span lang="EN-GB">: The user&#39;s IP address location is based on the ISP and in some cases, the user&rsquo;s physical location may differ from what our IP lookup indicates. This may be due to rerouted IP pools by the ISP and may result in a user not seeing ads that are targeted to limited geographic areas. IP mapping confidence improves as geographic targeting scope is broadened.</span></li>
			<li><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Mobile</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: IP-based geo-targeting may not work accurately for mobile ads due to the nature of mobile technology itself, and Radius Targeting requires end-users to share their location data.</span></span></span></li>

<h4><a id="6.4" name="6.4"></a>6.4 Physical location <a id="PhysicalLocation" title="PhysicalLocation"></a></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Advertisers can choose to include or exclude locations. Location exclusions are especially useful if advertisers have specific geographic areas to which they don&#39;t ship or provide services. They can also use it to offer targeted special promotions. Advertisers can retain their location exclusions when importing campaigns from Google. For example, if they&#39;ve targeted the United States but excluded some states, those exclusions will be supported when they import their campaigns.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">When targeting by Nielsen Designated Market Areas (DMAs) in the US and metro areas in other markets, it&rsquo;s important to remember that DMAs or metro areas may cross state boundaries. For example, Cincinnati, Ohio, is located on the border with Kentucky. When advertisers target Cincinnati, they also reach residents of Kentucky living in the Cincinnati DMA. DMAs are used in place of metro targeting in the US only but apply to advertisers outside the US who target US DMAs.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">If&nbsp;advertisers select a city name that has more than one possible state (for example, Portland, Maine, and Portland, and Oregon), they need to make sure that the correct state is indicated. It is possible that not all cities will be available in the pick list. Try using the search function to find the desired target&nbsp;or select the surrounding metro area or DMA.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">For advertisers targeting regions in Canada, selecting all available cities within a province is equivalent to selecting the whole province.</span></p>
