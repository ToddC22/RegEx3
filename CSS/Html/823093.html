<header><h1>A Scheduled Task Does Not Run When You Use Schtasks.exe to Create It and When the Path of the Scheduled Task Contains a Space</h1></header><div class='kb-notice-section section'>Template:  - Win2003 - Problem</div><div class='kb-notice-section section'>Note to Edit. The title words &quot;With a Space in the Path&quot; were requested to be included by tech review. </div><div class='kb-notice-section section'><div internal-content-body=""><div class="internal-content"><div class="bold internal-content-body-title spacer-12-bottom">Microsoft Internal Support Information</div><div class="row"><div class="col-xs-24 internal-content-body-content"><p>BUG #: <a href='http://bugcheck/bugs/WindowsSE/48264.asp' title='Link only available for Microsoft corporate network users' target='_blank'>48264 (Windows SE)</a></p></div></div></div></div></div><div class='kb-symptoms-section section'>When you use the Scheduled Tasks Wizard to schedule a task, the task runs as you expect. However, if you use the Schtasks.exe command-line tool to create a schedule for the same task, the task does not run at the time when you scheduled it. Additionally, when you view the task in the <strong class='uiterm'>Scheduled Tasks</strong> dialog box, the following text appears in the <strong class='uiterm'>Status</strong> column:<div class='indent'>Could not start</div></div><div class='kb-cause-section section'>This problem occurs if the  path of the scheduled task contains a space. For example, this problem occurs if you create a schedule for the following task by using Schtasks.exe:<div class='indent'>&quot;c:\<strong class='sbody-strong'>foldername containing spaces</strong>\task.bat&quot;</div>In this example, Schtasks.exe treats everything after the first space in the path as a command-line argument. </div><div class='kb-workaround-section section'>To work around this problem, enclose the path portion of the task (not including arguments or switches) between backslash (\) and quotation marks (&quot;) character combinations, for example \&quot;. Enclose the complete path of the task (including arguments or switches) between quotation marks as usual when you create a path or command that contains spaces. <br><br>For example, the following example task does not run when you schedule it: <div class='indent'>schtasks /create /tn &quot;my task&quot; /tr &quot;c:\foldername containing spaces\script.bat arguments&quot; /sc once /sd 07/29/2003 /st 10:01</div>However, when you enclose the path of the task between the  backslash and quotation marks character combinations as in the following example, the scheduled task runs successfully: <div class='indent'>schtasks /create /tn &quot;my task&quot; /tr &quot;<span class='text-base'>\&quot;</span>c:\foldername name containing spaces\script.bat<span class='text-base'>\&quot;</span> arguments&quot; /sc once /sd 07/29/2003 /st 10:01</div></div><div class='kb-securedata-section section'>sctasks</div><div class='kb-securedata-section section'>Author: craiga<br>Writer: v-deisle<br>Tech Reviewer: Kory Gill<br> Editor: v-jocoop</div>
