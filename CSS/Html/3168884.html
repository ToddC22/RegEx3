<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>One of the most common customer inquiries is: &ldquo;Why aren&rsquo;t my ads delivering?&rdquo; Customers may use the term &lsquo;delivery&rsquo; or &lsquo;delivering&rsquo; to describe several scenarios:</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>No impressions &ndash; The ads and keywords are in the UI, but the advertiser isn&rsquo;t seeing any impression data.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>No Clicks &ndash; The ads are receiving impressions, but they are receiving low or no clicks from potential customers.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>No Conversions &ndash; The advertiser is receiving impressions and clicks, but no conversions or sales.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>If the&nbsp;advertiser is concerned about impressions, ask if they have ever received impressions.</span>
	<ul>
		<li><span>While&nbsp;you are talking to the customer, also verify this in their account on the <strong>Campaign</strong> tab.&nbsp;<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Ensure the date range selection is set to reflect the date of the ad submission to today&rsquo;s date, or the date range specified by the customer.</span></li>

<h3><a id="8" name="8"></a>8. Non-delivery fraud checks: Insights and process</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>When entities are created/updated, a non-delivery Fraud check may be run on the account and/or ad group, which can temporarily cause impressions to stop. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>You can check if a Non-delivery Fraud Check is in effect using either AdInquiry or the Microsoft Advertising UI: </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>AdInquiry process: </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Locate the customer in AdInquiry.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check at <strong>Account</strong> level for the following: </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span asset="4538599" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4538599]</span></p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check at <strong>Ad Group Level</strong> for <strong>Fraud Status = 1</strong> which indicates the ad group is ON HOLD. (Fraud Status = 2 indicates that it is active.) </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span asset="4538600" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4538600]</span></p>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Microsoft Advertising UI process</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check the status of the keywords.&nbsp; A message of &lsquo;Ads not showing for Other reasons&rdquo; can indicate a non-delivery Fraud Check. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Even when &lsquo;Eligible&rsquo; is displayed for recently created/updated entities, select the ellipsis (three dots) next to the &lsquo;Eligible&rsquo; status of a Keyword.&nbsp; A pop-up will indicate whether any pending review checks are being run: </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Handling non-delivery fraud check issues</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Although most Fraud checks are resolved within 24 hours, multiple automated rules may be running at once, and these can extend the time it takes before delivery resumes. For this reason, <strong>advise customers it can take up to 72 hours</strong>, from the time at which an entity was last created/edited, before they should expect to see their performance. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>In the meantime, <strong>you can escalate to Global Support for help with non-delivery issues after 48 hours.</strong> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>For customer talking points, use the following: </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;Thanks&nbsp;</span></span></span>for your patience whilst I investigated this for you. Your ads are currently part of a seasonal review process, which will be resolved by&nbsp;<strong>[insert date here]</strong>. We use these checks to help improve the overall user experience on our platform, and thank you in advance for your understanding.&rdquo;<span></span></em></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>When closing your ticket, use the appropriate coding in ASD to categorize your ticket. (Under the &lsquo;Poor/No Performance&rsquo; Scenario.)</span></span></span></span></p>
