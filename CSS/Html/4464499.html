<h3><strong>Overview</strong></h3>

<p><span>This article&nbsp;provides guidance on how and when to handoff a Premier, Pro-Direct, Partner (PPP) case or task. This includes local language cases that require 24/7 support.</span></p>

<h3><strong><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy </strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>When can a <strong><span>whole case</span></strong> be handed off to another engineer?</span></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p><span><span>The case requires 24x7 ownership (i.e.&nbsp;Prem Sev A) <strong><span>or</span></strong>&nbsp;the customer requests it&nbsp;to have 24x7 ownership.</span></span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span><span>The customer formally requests to have the case owned by an engineer in a different timezone.</span></span></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span><span>The initial case owner is going on vacation <strong><span>and</span></strong> has&nbsp;been unsuccessful in finding a new owner themselves. </span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>When can a <strong><span>Task </span></strong>be handed off to another engineer?</span></span></p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p><span><span>The case owner is in a different timezone than the customer, and the customer requires a callback during their daytime (i.e. 3-strike callback; screenshare for troubleshooting, etc).</span></span></p>

	<p><span><span>When can the receiving engineer request a&nbsp;<strong><span>case credit</span></strong> from the Duty Managers for taking on a handoff case/task?</span></span></p>

		<p><span><span>If the receiving engineer will need to invest <strong><span>as much or more</span></strong> time into that handoff case as they would a new incoming case, and that time will be invested <strong><span>that day</span></strong>, they can request case credit from the Duty Managers (DM).</span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span>When is a <strong>warm handoff</strong> between the current&nbsp;and new engineer required?<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;A <em>warm handoff</em> is when an engineer hands their case off to a new engineer, ensuring that the new engineer is both introduced to the customer&nbsp;and appraised of the current situation with the case (preferably by phone).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span><span>For Premier Sev A cases,&nbsp;24x7 Sev B and other similar scenarios where the customer requests to continue working immediately with the next engineer.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

		<p><span><span>For any case where you think it is in the best interest of the </span><span>customer.</span></span></p>

<h3><strong>Handoff Process</strong></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>As the case owner, follow the process below to properly handoff your case/task.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Verify and confirm that the case/task meets the requirements for a handoff as outlined in the <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464499#Policy" target="_blank"><span>Policy</span></a> section above.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If you are not the original owner and the previous owner is on shift, let the previous owner know that you are assigning them a case/task for handoff that they owned previously. After receiving confirmation from the previous owner that they are available to accept the case, assign the case to them and notify them via email, with their manager cc&rsquo;d. An exception to this process is if the previous owner transferred the case in order to align to the customer&#39;s time zone.</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li>If the premier case is owned by&nbsp;PPP Mindtree&nbsp;(PPP MT) email&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto: pppmt@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">ASMS PPP MT</a>&nbsp;DL to make them aware of the case. Operation hours for this team is&nbsp;<em>Monday - Friday 12:00AM&nbsp;to 8:00AM&nbsp;PST</em> <em>(7:00AM&nbsp;to 03:00PM UTC)</em>&nbsp;only.&nbsp;<br>
		<br>
		<em><strong>Note: </strong></em>The PPP MT team will not be monitoring the Premier POD alias. If a MT case request comes in outside Mindtree&rsquo;s staffing intervals,&nbsp;please handle the case internally.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Create a <em>Note</em> in the case that includes the following details, or, if handing off a task, add these details to the body:</span></span></span></span></span><span><span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

		<li><span><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: For cases/tasks where the customer&rsquo;s preferred contact method is email, the case/task does <strong>not</strong> need to be handed off to the same time zone.
