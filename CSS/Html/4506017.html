<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Implementation approach:</strong><br>
<span><span><span><span>The MPA will be implemented for indirect resellers in a batch approach starting October 26, 2020, beginning with resellers with the lowest risk to revenue impact and expanding to additional resellers and geos depending on Microsoft exit criteria for each batch being met. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Upon implementation, indirect resellers who have not accepted the MPA will be unable to create new customers or place new orders for existing customers in the Cloud Solution Provider program. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Communication approach: </strong><br>
<span><span><span><span>Microsoft will be contacting indirect providers and indirect resellers directly over the coming weeks, reminding them of the implementation dates above and actions they need to take. Additionally, Microsoft will also contact indirect providers and indirect resellers</span></span></span> <span><span><span>ahead of their individual deadlines. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>No. If the agreement was signed by a representative of the company that was authorized to do so at the time or, as the acceptance language provides, represents to Microsoft that they are so authorized, then the MPA is valid.</p>

<p>CELA has proposed this language as a response to these requests:</p>

<p class="indent-1"><em>Please note that on<strong> [ date of acceptance_] </strong>a representative of your organization accepted the Microsoft Partner Agreement on behalf of your organization, representing that they were authorized to do so. Microsoft considers this to be legally valid and enforceable acceptance of the Microsoft Partner Agreement on behalf of your organization, which superseded all prior agreements between you and Microsoft regarding the subject matter addressed in the Microsoft Partner Agreement, including your participation in the Cloud Solution Provider Program.</em></p>

<p>The change in name of a company has no effect as to the validity of the MPA.</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>No, confirm to partners that there is no need to have a Gold Cloud Competency to be in the CSP program. The current MPA agreement posted in Partner Center is a preview so changes and corrections might be incorporated prior to publishing the final version.</p>

Or is the MPA the same for all partner types?</span></div>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>There is a difference between the Direct and Indirect Provider agreements, and the difference is the language within the contract and can&#39;t be determined by the title.</p>

<p>In the Online Services and Software Channel Authorization portion of the agreement, there will exist either</p>

<ul>
	<li>a reference to being able to resell to Customers &ndash; <strong>present only for Direct Bill MPAs</strong></li>
	<li>a reference to being able to resell to Indirect Resellers <strong>present only for Indirect Provider MPAs</strong></li>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>If a partner is marked as a MultiTier for Microsoft Partner Agreement in Prose, the MPA that they accepted is for Multi-tier partners. The title of the document does not reflect what type they agreement is, however, there is language within the document that covers Multi-tier partners. If the partner has any specific questions regarding the terms or language of the agreement, they should contact their Microsoft account manager or field sales.</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>The training requirements highlighted in the MPA is more inclusive, and more comprehensive than those provided in MPN. We encourage the partner to review their obligations under the MPA to confirm their compliance. The MPA provides that training obligations apply to &ldquo;<em>Company employees in a position to influence the pricing, terms, or conditions under which Microsoft&rsquo;s Products are distributed, resold, used, or marketed (but excluding employees engaged solely in distribution of Microsoft&rsquo;s Products to end consumers).</em>&rdquo; Training must be provided on a &ldquo;regular&rdquo; basis &ndash; which would likely be whatever is commercially reasonable &ndash; but the Partner must interpret this portion of the agreement themselves.&nbsp;</p>
