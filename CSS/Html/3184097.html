<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</h3>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Microsoft Audience Network (MSAN) is the name we use to describe the process by which Microsoft empowers our advertisers to target customers using native placement (for example, ads contained within website content) through non-search experiences on O&amp;O and syndicated partner websites. These ads are integrated into the user experience of the webpage on which they&rsquo;re displayed, and function across device.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>We are able to do this using our Microsoft Graph (the data Microsoft stores on customers, obtained through products/services operated by Microsoft to determine things such as demographics, location, and LinkedIn info) and AI logic to provide smart ad-selection, relevancy matching and pricing/click/conversion predictions, to deliver the best return on investment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The Audience Network aims to provide an alternative to traditional search marketing campaigns, by offering advertisers the ability to target&nbsp;<strong>people</strong>&nbsp;through things such as Audience Ads, In-Market Audience lists, or Custom Audiences.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>MSAN does not rely on keywords to get an advertiser&rsquo;s ads in front of customers. Instead, we use Audience Signals&nbsp;to determine when an ad should be shown. (Audience Signals = one or more unique attributes, such as age/gender/LinkedIn-info/remarketing data.)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>MSAN ads do not appear on search engine results pages. Instead, they appear in native placements on MSN, Outlook, Edge, Syndicated Partners. These are known as Audience Ads.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span><strong><span><span><a id="2" name="2"></a></span></span></strong></span>2. Audience Ads<span><strong><span><span> </span></span></strong></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>Audience ads do not have ranking positions and show exclusively on MSAN. Page placement is pre-determined by the publisher and ads will show in the slots the publisher has available for Audience Ads. For example, on the MSN homepage, as the publisher, MSN has decided Audience Ads will show in the infopane at the top of the page, as well as dedicated slots in both the middle and bottom of the page.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span asset="4493002" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4493002]</span></span></span><br>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Where will Audience Ads show?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Audience ads will show on the Microsoft Audience Network on sites like MSN, Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Edge, and other partners (with more to come over time). </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>What are the benefits of using Microsoft Audience Ads? </span></span></strong><span><span><br>
Along with being the only native advertising solution optimized for search advertisers, Audience Ads can be a powerful tool for advertisers. </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Highly relevant audience. </span></strong><span>A variety of signals, such as search history, site remarketing and page content, help deliver ads that are highly relevant to customer intent. Advertisers can take advantage of these consumer intent signals to target their audience through our premium publishing partners. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Boosted volume and more conversions. </span></strong><span>Advertisers can scale ads to a larger audience and increase chances for conversions. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span>Ease of use.</span></strong><span> Advertisers can use familiar setup and campaign management tools that are fully integrated with Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span>All extensions (both manual and automated) that are available for standard Microsoft Advertising text ads. </span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Advertisers should remember these steps:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Optimise campaigns for Audience Ads by choosing bid modifiers (+900% to primarily target Audience Ads, or -100% to exclude Audience Ads.) This is done via the campaign or Ad Group <strong>Settings</strong> page, under <strong>Other Settings &gt; Audience Ads</strong>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Indicate a preference that specific expanded text ads should be displayed in the Audience Ads format (on the Ad creation page). </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Create </span><span>image extensions</span><span lang="EN-GB"> </span><span lang="EN-GB"> to support the ads, </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>see KB </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/2686702" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span><span>2686702 Process: Microsoft Advertising: Ad Extensions</span></span></span></span></span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>. Although images aren&rsquo;t required, Audience Ads may not receive premium placement without them. Automated image extensions may be used to add image content if no image is provided, so a best practice is always to provide at least two images via Image Extensions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB">If they exist, advertisers can link to existing Remarketing/Audience lists via the <strong>Create Association</strong> option, on the <strong>Audiences</strong> sub-tab.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Test and&nbsp;optimise, based on performance data in the campaign&#39;s grids and via reports. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Notes</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB">Audience Ads metrics (for example, CTR and Quality Score) will not impact search campaign performance. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Advertisers can create separate ad copy within a search campaign which will show only for Audience Ads placements. By using Custom Ad Text for Audience Ads, ad copy can be tailored specifically for native placements. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Every ad group requires at least one search ad copy in addition to custom ad copy for Audience Ads. If the ad group has only one ad and that ad is marked as <strong>preferred for Audience</strong>,&nbsp;then that flag will be ignored, and the ad will be served for both Audience Ads and search ads. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>We recommend using custom ad text and applying bid modifiers to optimize Audience Ads being run through existing search campaigns. </span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>When an advertiser creates either type of Audience Ad campaign, they will need to select which audiences they wish to target (for example, Device/Age/Gender/Feed).

See example below.</span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>After they have selected the audiences to target, the advertiser will need to choose a <strong>Target Setting</strong>&nbsp;from one of two bid options: </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>These determine how/when the Audience Ads will be eligible for delivery, as follows: </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Bid only:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Ads will show to all customers in the Audience Network, (<strong>unless specifically excluded</strong>) and Bid Boosts will be applied to any audience segments that have been selected for a bid increase. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Target and bid:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Ads will only be shown to customers if they are within at least one of EACH audience that has been targeted. For example, in the screenshot above, the customer would need to be in the US <strong>and</strong> 18-24 <strong>and</strong> Female <strong>and</strong> on a desktop/tablet.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>As a best practice, we recommend using <strong>Target and Bid</strong> first, and expanding to <strong>Bid Only</strong> if targeting seems too narrow.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56706/1" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>Image extensions</span></span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> are recommended (but not required) to ensure Audience Ads will display in the best possible location on Bing. <strong>Note</strong>: Without image extensions, Bing will select an appropriate image using automated image extensions, which may not best reflect the advertiser&rsquo;s marketing goals for the ad.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>For this reason, it is recommended that advertisers manually add image extensions, to give them more control over their images and how their brand is showcased.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Images will be reviewed through the editorial system prior to going live. Review the help content to learn more about setup and image specification guidelines. Advertisers need to adhere to the current image policies regarding functionality and quality, see KB </span></span></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/2970603" target="_blank"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span>2970603 Policy: Image, Audio, and Video Ad Policies (2970603)</span></span></span></span></span></a><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>. Images will be stored in the DAM system and will be uploaded only when they have passed editorial review.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If an advertiser is meeting the editorial guidelines and was erroneously rejected, an appeal can be submitted to the editorial team following the normal appeals process.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><strong><span><span><a id="5" name="5"></a></span></span></strong></span>5. Opting out of Audience Ads (Search campaigns only)</h3>

<p><span><span><span>To stop receiving traffic from Audience Ads, you must set the Audience Ads Bid Modifier to -100% for all campaigns. </span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>From the <strong>Campaigns</strong> or <strong>Ad Groups</strong> tab, select the name of the campaign or ad group you want to adjust.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Under <strong>Advanced settings</strong>, select <strong>Audience Ads</strong>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Adjust the bid: </span></span></span></span>
	<ol>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Decrease</strong> <strong>by</strong> if you want to invest less. To opt out of Audience Ads completely, decrease your bid by 100%.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Increase by</strong> if you want to opt back in or invest more in Audience Ads for this campaign or ad group. You can adjust the bid up to 900% for maximum participation. </span></span></span></span></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span>These settings will only apply to existing campaigns/ad groups. Any new campaigns that are created/imported later will also need their <strong>Audience Ads Bid Adjustment</strong> value set to -100% (for opt-out).</span></span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>What is the high-priority ad takedown process?</span></span></strong><span><span><br>
If an Audience Ad is displaying explicit/offensive content and needs to be removed ASAP, please send an email to the Audience Ads Engineering team (</span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:nativeads-dri@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">nativeads-dri@microsoft.com</a><span><span>) with the R-Link or the Account ID and image details (for example,&nbsp;screenshot and image URL). Engineering will take the ad down within 24 hours (but likely much faster than that).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: Create a child ticket and email the team from the child, so that this is registered as an escalation in internal reporting.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Block-listed customers</span></span></strong><span><span><br>
Some specific advertisers, such as pharmaceutical and other sensitive business types, are block-listed from serving on the Audience Ad network. You will be advised if a customer is block-listed after escalating to Global Support for lack of impressions,&nbsp;we do not expose this information in the UI.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This is to prevent the risk of DSAT and&nbsp;poor end-user experiences by exposing sensitive products/services to customers which may not be relevant, or should not be exposed in this fashion due to industry/legal requirements.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><strong><span><span><a id="6" name="6"></a></span></span></strong></span>6. Troubleshooting Audience Ad issues</h3>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Use the following guidance to solve for common Audience Ad setup issues:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Problem</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: <strong>Image uploads are generating errors (for example, height/width errors).</strong></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Solution: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Ask customer for the image they want to upload. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check it meets </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://advertiseonbing.blob.core.windows.net/blob/bingads/media/library/creative-specs/msan_spec.pdf" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising Image Requirements</span></span></span></span></span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Work with the customer to crop/swap the image for one that meets the guidelines and re-upload.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Problem: Non-Delivery or &lsquo;Ad Group Privacy Pending&rsquo; error message.</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Solution</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Locate the Ad Group with this message.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Check Ad Group <strong>Delivery Status</strong>. If the status is <strong>Ad group targeting too narrow</strong>, see KB </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4514255" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span><span>4514255 Delivery: Troubleshoot MSAN Audience campaigns with Privacy status TargetingTooNarrow</span></span></span></span></span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If this is not the issue, check the <strong>Audience</strong> <strong>List</strong> (such as Remarketing and Custom Audience) to see when these were created. There is a 48-hour delivery delay between adding a new list and delivery.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If it has been more than 48 hours since the Audience List was added to the campaign, escalate to Global Support for assistance. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Problem: Ad headlines are being cut off when viewing them in the Audience Ads Ad Preview display.</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Solution</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>N/A &ndash; Headlines may be truncated based on the way various publishers show them. Advertisers can ensure ad headlines will show on all publisher sites by shortening their ad copy. <strong>Note:</strong> This is called out in the UI preview guidance<em>: &ldquo;These are examples of how your audience ads could appear. Depending on placement, the actual ad shown may appear differently -- for example, some text may be shortened.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><strong><span><span><a id="7" name="7"></a></span></span></strong></span>7. FAQ</h3>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: I don&rsquo;t see Audience Ad impressions even though my bid modifiers are optimized for this service. Why is this? </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>(To be used only with<strong> block-listed </strong>customers.)</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Not all business types can be shown as Audience Ads, due to the sensitive nature of the product/service being offered by the business. For example, businesses providing services/products which require industry and legal regulation, may not be shown for this reason.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></span></span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Do Audience Ads include LinkedIn?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Currently no. For now, Audience Ads will only show on MSN and Outlook but as we continue to integrate LinkedIn into the Microsoft family, we will explore this possibility.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Will Microsoft Advertising be the only ad provider for MSN and Outlook?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Microsoft Advertising is one of the many ad providers that MSN and Outlook use. In addition to Microsoft Advertising, some of the other companies powering ads are AppNexus, TripleLift, Taboola, and Outbrain.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Is there a filtering process in place to avoid Audience Ads from serving next to unflattering news articles? For example: A Delta Audience Ad shows next to an article about a plane crash?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> Audience Ads, like normal Microsoft Advertising, are set up to detect negative sentiment documents/topics algorithmically. When such an MSN page is detected, it will not render an Audience Ad. However, in the rare case Audience Ads miss it, you can escalate to Global Support and this will then be addressed with utmost priority.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Should I anticipate traffic spikes with Audience Ads?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>There can be times when an article gets very popular and receives abnormally high traffic. At the same time, that content is very relevant to an advertiser. This can lead to a situation where an advertiser can get much higher traffic than normal. Any traffic increase received by the advertiser is allowed if it is like the historical traffic an advertiser had previously received in their account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Do Audience Ads in MSAN campaigns have a dedicated r-link compatible with AdInquiry?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> Yes. Can be captured in the same way by right clicking the ad. Some URLs may begin with </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://www.bing.com/api/v1/" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span><span>https://www.bing.com/api/v1/</span></span></span></span></span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>.<strong> </strong>In this case, you will need to use the <strong>EXCELTOOLMACRO</strong> to generate the r-link.<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: For <strong>Edge</strong> browser use, you may need to follow these steps to obtain the r-link:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Press <strong>F12</strong>, navigate to the <strong>Elements</strong> tab, and search for the domain (for example, jcpenney) in the search bar.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The r</span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>-link is included in the href=&quot; &quot; parameter.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Do Audience Ads compete with other providers such as AppNexus or Taboola on websites like MSN or Outlook for bids/relevance?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A: Internal only:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> We share a percentage of traffic with other providers, yes. Certain areas of the page will be reserved exclusively for Audience Ad content from Search/MSAN campaigns.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How should we optimise Audience Ads in MSAN campaigns?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>You can use Bid Landscape settings to see how impression estimated would change, based on bid adjustments. Advertisers may want to have ad groups with lower bids set to target a broad range of dimensions, and a more specialised ad group set to target focused dimensions at a higher bid. The ads should also be tailored to suit the segments they&rsquo;re targeting, and that there is enough budget to allow delivery.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Can we import Audience Campaigns from Google Ads?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> Yes.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Can we manage Audience Campaigns using Bing Ads Editor?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> Not at the current time.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Can we check ad delivery using Ad Preview or a similar tool?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> Not at the current time.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: Is there a full list of syndicated partners comprising the Audience Network available to share to advertisers?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> We do not share a full list of partners, but we continue to expand. (For example, Verizon Media Properties.)</span></span></span></span></span></p>
