<h3>1. Policy guidelines</h3>

<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Policy enforcement</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Each vendor site will perform bi-weekly credit audits of all credits and refunds given for that </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>time, and these will be reviewed with the aligned TA.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="" target="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a>1.2 General refund discussion guidelines</h4>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Never proactively offer a refund or offer more than the advertiser is requesting. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Never set customer expectations on the amount or percentage&nbsp;of the refund they can expect in advance of TA approval.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>First identify the root cause, fix the issue, and calculate the value that should be considered in the dispute based on the customer&rsquo;s complaint. Document all changes within the ticket and attach any supporting documentation.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Only consider charges within the <strong>60 days </strong>prior to the initial support ticket creation date. All scenarios below should be considered within the 60-day range, unless a TA grants approval. </span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>For post-pay/threshold and invoice accounts, consider charges invoiced/charged 60 days prior to support contact.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>For prepay disputes, consider clicks accrued in the 60 days prior to support contact.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Any Platinum advertiser (managed or unmanaged) requesting a refund over $5,000&nbsp;requires additional approval by Platinum segment owners, which will be facilitated by TA&rsquo;s. Do not promise advertisers any refund value prior to appropriate internal approvals.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Document everything within the ticket and attach any supporting documents or reports. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If there is a viable legal or physical threat, to either you or the customer, always raise the concern to a manager and TA for discussion, regardless of the policy. See KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3174388" managed-link="" target="_blank">3174388 Guidelines for Unexpected Events During Client Contacts</a> for additional actions. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Do not process any refunds until you have TA approval (if necessary) or the advertiser accepts the offer and agrees to make the changes (in user education scenarios).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Adjusted amounts do not include taxes. If taxes were charged, they will appear on the payment invoice as a separate line item.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Refunds will be to the original payment method, except for bank transfers and Boleto, which are processed as Offline Refunds by check or wire transfer. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Consult a TA if the advertiser specifically requests a refund to the payment method instead of a reduction in outstanding charges.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Depending on the scenario, the customer may not be eligible for a refund, eligible for only a partial refund, or, if the root cause was a technical issue, a full refund. Check the refund policy in </span></span><a bookmark-id="1.3" href="#1.3" managed-link=""><span><span><span>section 1.3</span></span></span></a><span><span> below to determine whether a full or partial credit can be offered.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Adjustments must not be split across users or days and must be within a user&#39;s role limit (see </span></span><a bookmark-id="1.5" href="#1.5" managed-link=""><span><span><span>section 1.5</span></span></span></a><span><span>).</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a>1.3 Refund policy</h4>

<p><strong>1.3.1</strong> <strong>For monthly invoice accounts, open a dispute with&nbsp;Global Financial Services&nbsp;(GFS), to suspend monthly invoice collections</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Global Financial Services was also known as Worldwide Online Credit Services (WOCS)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p>If the dispute cannot be resolved same day, Post Collections must be informed to suspend any collections efforts while the issue is open.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Complete the details for <strong>Issue Category=</strong> <strong>WOCS Escalations</strong> &gt; <strong>Issue Type =WOCS Collections Inquiry</strong> and submit an escalation <strong>Sub-Team =</strong> <strong>Regional/WOCS - Dispute/Post-Collections</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Notify Post Collections of the following: </span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Issue related details to suspend collections for Billing &amp; Payments.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><strong>1.3.2 Scenarios eligible for a full activity adjustment:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Technical issue or bug </span></span></strong><span><span>&ndash; A system issue verified by Ad Support that caused unwanted spend or significant issues for the account</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Internal error </span></span></strong><span><span>&ndash; Error made by someone from Microsoft Advertising that caused the customer to have undesired spend.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Trending Now clicks for sensitive topic </span></span></strong><span><span>&ndash; Advertiser saw a sharp spike in traffic due to a trending tragic news event or natural disaster. These are&nbsp;invalid clicks, refundable without escalation to Network Quality Services (NQS) but should be approved by your TA. Be sure to document business justification. Refer to the</span></span><a href="https://sharepoint.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/sites/StandardSupport/l1resources/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span><span><span> Escalation Guide</span></span></span></a><span><span> for Sub-Team details.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Customers filing for bankruptcy</span></span></strong><span><span> &ndash; See resolution steps below.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Customer is now deceased</span></span></strong><span><span><br>
	<strong>Note: </strong>Also pause the account.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1.3.3 Scenarios eligible for partial/negotiated activity adjustment: </strong></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li><strong>User education &ndash;</strong> A customer in good standing did not understand one or more settings&nbsp;in Microsoft Advertising, incurring overspend as a result.<br>
	<br>
	Before applying a refund/credit, provide guidance on the functionality for their future reference, and help walk them through the necessary changes. In &lsquo;User Education&rsquo; instances it is advised to first offer 25% (with up to 50%) of the perceived overspend for charges billed in the last&nbsp;<strong>60 days prior to support contact</strong>. Do not disclose or promise a specific refund value in advance of TA approval. Instead of a specific amount, say <em>&quot;let me see if I can get approval to get you a refund.&quot;</em><br>
	<br>
	For user education scenarios, ensure the advertiser is clear that this is a <strong>one-time goodwill</strong> <strong>credit</strong> as we value his/her business, <strong>not</strong> because of a fault of Microsoft Advertising.</li>
	<li><strong>Customer claims they meant to pause their account months or years ago</strong>. In this case, we can give a refund of 50% of the billed charges for the last <strong>60 days </strong>only once we verify that the account is paused.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>1.3.4 Scenarios where it is NOT permitted to negotiate/offer a customer a credit or refund:</strong></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li><strong>Invalid </strong><strong>clicks</strong> &ndash; Support should not negotiate invalid click refunds with the customer. TQ must investigate and if necessary, refunds will be processed by TQ on the backend of the UI.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Agency mismanagement </strong>&ndash; Customer issue with how their current or former agency was handling their account. These refunds/credits should be deferred to the agency.</li>
	<li><strong>Charges to incorrect card </strong>&ndash; It is the customer&#39;s responsibility to maintain their desired payment method in the UI.</li>
	<li><strong>Bank overdraft fees</strong> &ndash; It is the customer&#39;s responsibility to manage their own bank accounts and not overdraft.<br>
	<strong>Note</strong><strong>: </strong>Bank overdraft fees resulting from the SEPA duplicative charges that occurred on November 2<sup>nd</sup>,&nbsp;&nbsp;2017 ARE eligible for adjustment.</li>
	<li><strong>No Sales/Poor ROI </strong>&ndash; Customer claims they did not receive any sales from their Microsoft Advertising campaign and wants a refund for spend.</li>
	<li><strong>Estimated sales lost </strong>&ndash; Customer went dark prematurely due to either an error with their IO or other budget depletion and wants a refund for time they were offline due to perceived sales they could have made (Exception: If budget depletion or IO error occurred due to technical issue as confirmed by Ad Support).</li>
	<li><strong>Repeat user ed requests </strong>&ndash; Retention credits are only considered for first-time errors.</li>
	<li><strong>Requested changes made on their behalf </strong>&ndash; Customer contacted support and requested advocate to make changes to their account on their behalf, then later calls disputing any charges that occurred due to the changes. If the original change instructions were followed correctly, no refund will be provided.</li>
	<li><strong>Coupon code depleted, charges accrued on pay method </strong>&ndash; Customer contacts support saying that they received spend on their specified payment method after their coupon code depleted/expired and they did not understand that this would occur. The mail that the customer receives with their coupon code clearly states they will begin to spend when their coupon depletes or expires.</li>
	<li>Charges billed over <strong>60 days </strong>prior to the support contact.</li>
	<li><strong>Trending Now clicks for topic relevant to their business model</strong> &ndash; Advertiser saw a spike in traffic due to a topic relevant for their business model trending in search traffic.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Note: </strong>Offer to opt the advertiser out of Trending Now Traffic if they are interested. This is done by escalating to Global Support.</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li><strong>Fraud refunds to online payment methods.</strong> See&nbsp;KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3169386" target="_blank">3169386 Process: Microsoft Advertising: Fraud Status</a>&nbsp;for refund eligibility.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Test Campaigns </strong>- If the advertiser agrees to the changes, the traffic is legitimate. Be sure to document customer agreement of proposed changes in your ticket.</li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Do not over-apologize or assume the advertiser is entitled to a refund. Empathize and inform the advertiser that we won&rsquo;t be able to give a refund. Address what you can offer, such as educational opportunities, assistance with preventing recurrence, or a support coupon.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><em><span><span><span>&quot;We apologize for any inconvenience this issue may have caused, but we do not offer credits or refunds for __________. &quot;</span></span></span></em></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;I will escalate this scenario for review before I can authorize a specific refund value.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;I can definitely understand why you feel that way and can understand your frustration. What I can do is to help you set up ______ to meet your needs.&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;I realize you are unhappy with the way ______ is working. Why don&rsquo;t we take a moment and walk through how this works so that you can set up your campaign/account to help maximize the ROI?&rdquo;</span></span></span></em></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><em><span><span><span>&ldquo;I realize that our tool works differently from other advertising tools.

Prepay balance refunds are <em>not</em> subject to the refund policy below &ndash; available funds <em>must</em> be returned to the customer if requested and will be automatically returned if the account is closed (by fraud or by manual deactivation).</span></span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">

		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If an offline payment was made but has not posted in the UI, contact the GFS (also known as WOCS) CashApps team to get missing offline payment posted before issuing credits. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Prepay customers with a refundable balance may desire reapplication of funds to an existing Microsoft Advertising account (instead of an offline refund). Requests to reapply prepay funds should be raised with a request to CashApps. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>SEPA payments should only be adjusted <strong>after</strong> <strong>eight weeks</strong>.

<p><span><strong><span><span>Account holds &amp; credit limitations</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Prepay customer account hold status is sometimes the result of credit card payment failure. To resolve this the customer may want to use a different payment method (for example, post-pay to prepay) or payment instrument (for example, credit card to bank transfer). However, system limitations don&#39;t always make the desired changes possible. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Below are the top troubleshooting steps to resolve the customer hold. If an account has no current activity, <strong>do not attempt to credit their statement</strong>. This will only show as a pending credit memo (balance will not be reduced, and hold will not be lifted).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Assist customers by:</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Recommend that the customer contact their banking institution to resolve the card failure.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Recommend that the customer switch to another card payment option (contact Global Support if this is an issue).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If they have current activity, you may be able to credit a portion of the current activity to release the hold and allow the charge to settle and/or move to the updated payment method (rebilling all or a portion of that value to the new payment method).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Escalate to your TA if there are scenarios where:</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>We are recommending that the customers create a new campaign. </span></span></span></span></span></li>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Refund receipts for offline payment methods (including check/wire/Boleto methods) will appear in the UI immediately, but do not accurately reflect the status of the actual refund. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>For the customer to receive their refund, CSS must ensure charges are reversed in the UI, then submit an offline refund request to the regional SANOPs Team. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Payments must first appear in the Microsoft Advertising UI before an offline refund can be initiated through SANOPs. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the original payment is missing, submit a request to GFS (also known as WOCS) CashApps to ensure the payment is properly loaded to the prepay account. SANOPs cannot process a refund unless it is showing as&nbsp;<strong>declined&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>failed</strong>&nbsp;in the UI.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note on invoice customers:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Offline Refunds for Invoice Accounts (SAP), including valid or failed credit memos should be directed to <strong>Cash Apps Team</strong> alias, who will take the issue details from UCM and request the refund from their internal GFS &nbsp;Refund Team (who does not use UCM). From there, GFS Refund will work with AP to generate the request. SANOPs does<strong> not</strong> process refunds for invoice customers (SAP payment method), this includes successful and failed credit memos. If the customer is using invoice (SAP) as their payment method, a refund will generate a credit memo the following month to their account, which can be applied to their account balance by contacting their regional <strong>GFS) Collections</strong> team. If the credit memo has failed, the refund is not rendering in the UI, or the customer simply desires their credit returned in the form of a refund, then CSS must escalate to <strong>GFS Collections Account Team </strong>for assistance.</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>UCP (Unclaimed Property or fka Uncollected Property) is an annual process</span></span></strong><span><span> of escheating unused funds on U.S. customer accounts (or accounts considered U.S. aligned by default, due to no registered ABL). If a customers account is deemed inactive due to no login activity, unused funds will be moved from Microsoft to their local states government after a determined time period. &nbsp;&nbsp;You will know if a customers funds have been submitted to UCP or their local state government if the following apply:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Balance will show as $0</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Amount paid will show with refunded value &quot;<em>deemed Unclaimed Property</em>&quot;</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Their last statement will include note that funds went to unclaimed property and to contact ucpcorp@microsoft.om</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>CSS Action: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Authenticated customers inquiring about their funds should be redirected to the ucpcorp alias. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>There is no need to escalate on their behalf. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Customers are advised to provide their last statement to the UCP Team (which includes the reference to <a href="mailto:ucpcorp@microsoft.com">ucpcorp@microsoft.com</a>). This will help validate and streamline their request to the UCP Team. </span></span></span></li>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Tickets should be coded accordingly: </span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Prepay Account Management &gt; General Education &gt; Unclaimed Property</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For context, the complete process for UCP occurs over several months and customers are notified via email along the way. The process occurs as follows:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>US customers who have unspent (prepaid) funds in their account are notified via mail that their funds are with Microsoft Advertising and they have the option to use (spend) or collect their funds (contact Sales or CSS to request a refund).</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If the customer does not claim their funds within the specified time period, the customer will be notified via email that their unused and unclaimed funds have been moved to <a href="mailto:ucp@microsoft.com">ucp@microsoft.com</a> as an interim step. During this interim step the customer should reach out to the UCP team directly. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Once additional time has passed (typically 30 days) the funds that are being temporarily held by UCP Team will be sent to their respective local governments, this process is called escheatment. This state is determined by the customers legal business address OR if left unspecified this will be the state of Nevada (where Microsoft Online Corp. resides). </span></span></span><span><span><span>Customers can tell if their funds have been escheated by looking at the statement for references to UCP, which will direct them to contacting <a href="mailto:ucpcorp@microsoft.com" target="_blank"><span>ucpcorp@microsoft.com</span></a> for next steps. CSS should redirect any customer inquiries related to UCP or escheated funds to the <a href="mailto:ucpcorp@microsoft.com" target="_blank"><span>ucpcorp@microsoft.com</span></a> alias, there is no need to escalate on the customers behalf. </span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: As of August 2018, SANOPs does not perform an automated refund process via check. If a customer contacts CSS for a refund they have not received, SANOPs can check to see if the refund was already sent to the customer, prior to processing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Duplicate offline refund requests:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Submit an offline refund status inquiry to SANOPs to confirm whether a check/wire refund has already been processed for a specific refund billing document.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="2.5" name="2.5"></a>2.5 Invoice activity adjustments</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In monthly invoice accounts, adjustments to activity from a previous month will result in a credit memo, which will be generated at the close of the billing cycle along with all other billing documents.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Credit memo values will not automatically be applied to invoices. The advertiser will need to contact the customer service alias on their invoices to specify how to apply the credit memo against other invoices.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To view adjustments for invoice advertisers:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the adjustment is given to a charge that has already been invoiced, you can view the activity in the online statement in the Microsoft Advertising user interface.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the adjustment is given in the current balance tab (during the month that has not yet been invoiced), it will adjust the amount shown in the current amount column but will not appear as a stand-alone credit or debit.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Invoice payment status is reflected in the UI but does not indicate credit due to overpayment &ndash; this information is stored solely in SAP. If an advertiser overpays an invoice, the overage can be applied to any other invoice just like a credit memo. If a credit has been applied after paying an invoice, the credit will only show in SAP.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="2.6" name="2.6"></a>2.6 Redeeming credit memos</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Credit memos will appear immediately in the Billing tab but will <strong>not </strong>be deducted from the balance due at the end of the next billing cycle. At the close of the next billing cycle, the advertiser will receive the invoice for the full value of activity accrued during that period as well as a separate credit memo for the credits applied. The advertiser must contact the customer service alias noted on the invoice and specify which invoice document number they would like to use the credit memo against. For example: &ldquo;<em>Please apply credit memo ID# against invoice ID#</em>&rdquo;. Then the advertiser should submit payment for any remaining amount due.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link=""><span><span><span><span><span>Return to top</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></a></p>

<h4><a id="2.7" name="2.7"></a>2.7 Prepay refunds</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Payment adjustments should never be processed for more than the available balance remaining on the account. If the advertiser is due back more than the balance, always adjust activity to increase the balance before adjusting a payment transaction. Otherwise, the payment adjustment will cause the account balance to go negative. If the account balance does go negative, do not apply an activity adjustment to solve for this. Instead the customer should submit a new payment.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If an activity credit is granted to a prepay customer, and the customer would like to receive a refund instead of increasing their available balance, the value of the credit must be applied twice: once to reverse the activity, and again as a payment adjustment to send the funds back to the payment method. Doing so will <strong>not </strong>double refund the advertiser.<br>
<br>
As a best practice, do not adjust a payment transaction unless the advertiser intends to discontinue advertising or specifically requests the funds be returned to the payment method.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If an advertiser requests a refund for available funds that were submitted more than a year ago, assist the advertiser with closing their account to auto-generate the refund and proceed with the appropriate offline refund process.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Offline refunds typically occur when a reversal is made to a customer&rsquo;s offline payment method, in which case the refund does not get back to the customers primary PI. Offline refund requests should be sent to SANOPs, unless it&rsquo;s one of the following situations:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>SAP (invoice) is the customers payment method </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the offline payment (check/wire) is not appearing in the UI as expected</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span>Below are common scenarios for requesting an offline refund:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong>Note: </strong>See KB <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3169386" target="_blank">3169386 </a>for offline refund eligibility when an account is closed for some form of fraud and is inquiring about their prepay balance or post pay charges (<strong>Note</strong>: Special process must be followed to determine offline refund eligibility in fraud scenarios)<span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>A balance refund was processed in the UI against an offline payment method (because of manual deactivation, fraud closure, or other payment reversal). </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Refund receipt shows declined by an online payment method (credit/debit card) and Global Support has confirmed the funds were not sent to the customer&rsquo;s financial institution.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>For eligible .fraud accounts, request that the fraud team reviews the account before initiating an offline refund. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The customer requests for WHT/TDS reimbursement of taxes paid to the government. If advertisers are required to pay the Withholding tax to the government, they must provide the tax receipt to request reimbursement. For Offline PI&rsquo;s, you will submit the Foreign Tax Certificate (FTC), along with the refund request. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer does not want to close their account but requires reversal of available balance payment submitted over a year ago, only SANOPs can adjust balance over one+ year. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="3.1" name="3.1"></a>3.1 How to submit offline refunds</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Ensure that the refund is reflected in the Microsoft Advertising user interface before escalating to SANOPs. <strong>Note:</strong> No offline refunds are needed for SAP customers (unless they are closing their account and have no open invoices).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>There are two&nbsp;methods of offline refund payments:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Check -</strong>&nbsp;All checks are sent via from Reno, Nevada (US). Consider this when providing customers with an SLA.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Wire transfer -</strong>&nbsp;For some markets (such as IN and BR) refunds via wire transfer are the only option available even if the payment was initially submitted as a check. In most markets, the form of payment is ultimately the customer&#39;s decision.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span>The following table outlines the primary refund payment method in each market (indicating where check refunds are not available). The &quot;X&quot; indicates the primary method.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>As of July 9th, 2018, there is no need to submit the HBI form. For security and privacy purposes, offline refund requests must be submitted to your regional SANOPs team (prepay payment methods) OR </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>GFS (</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>also known as WOCS) </span></span></span><span><span><span>(SAP payment method). Both options are sent via escalation email from ASD (KB </span></span></span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3170756" target="_blank"><span><span><span>3170756 Process: Microsoft Advertising: Escalating to Partners using UCMT, COSMIC, and CAP</span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span>). If any additional customer documentation or bank details outside of the template escalation are required, you must follow standard DTM protocol, to protect sensitive customer information.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The following fields are required in the ASD escalation: (Sent via email to SANOPs or GFS for SAP, in rare instances)</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Declined billing document ID (if applicable)</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Offline payment receipt ID (if applicable)</span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Payee email contact</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Email language (English is the default, if the customer has another preferred language it can be requested, and they will receive the MPC email and link in this language.)</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>*Items marked should match exactly with Microsoft Advertising and inability to verify may delay process.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong>For all offline refunds (check/wire)</strong>, set customer expectations that they will receive an email from Microsoft Payment Central. The customer must complete the MPC process (including banking information for wire payments and address for check payments)&nbsp;before the refund can be approved and processed. Once the customer is sent a link to Microsoft Payment Central (MPC) they have 30 days to complete the required details, or the link expires. During this initial 30-day period, follow up and communication between CSS, the customer and SANOPs is important to ensure timely completion. Unless CSS requests assistance from SANOPs, they will only&nbsp;keep their ticket open during the first 10 days of this period. Once the customer has completed MPC details, SANOPs will proceed with processing the payment. If there is no communication between CSS and SANOPs within this 10-day period, the ticket will be closed after a 10-day reminder, assuming the customer will complete details on their own or may no longer wish to pursue the refund.<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>During this 30-day period, CSS may assist with customer questions (utilizing SANOPs as an escalation point, if needed) to complete the MPC portion of the process and provide status updates. Should the customer go non-responsive, CSS should make three attempts to follow up with the customer over the course of an extended 10-day period. If the customer remains non-responsive at the time of this outreach, the ASD ticket can be closed. However, CSS should not request SANOPs close the ticket on their end within this 30-day period. Doing so will only confuse the SANOPs and AP teams, who have a 30&nbsp;period in which they are expecting the customer will complete MPC details. Once customer details are completed, internal process and approvals will continue between AP and SANOPs, in the workflow outlined below. During this time, SANOPs may follow up if there&#39;s an update to the refund status which may help set appropriate customer expectations if the customer is still in contact or attempts to contact CSS for status.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Refund SLA&rsquo;s are largely dependent on information provided, customer action, and internal approvals. The process outline for wire refunds is below and offers general guidance on the steps and SLA&#39;s for each portion of the process. <strong>Details of each step are provided as internal guidance only</strong> and may be useful for interpreting updates received from SANOPs. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Keep the ticket open until the customer is non-responsive after three&nbsp;follow-ups (over the course of 10 days). Ideally the MPC link will be sent within this time.

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: For prepay advertisers whose check/wire payments did not reach the UI, reach out to Accounts Receivable (Transfer to WW Online Credit Services&gt;GFS Accounts Receivable) to get the payment applied&nbsp;in the UI. Once payment is viewable in the UI, it will need to be credited out by CSS before requesting an offline&nbsp;refund via your regional SANOPs team.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: For Boleto advertisers closed for fraud with payment that did not reach the UI &ndash; escalate to Fraud Ads to confirm if the account can be reinstated. If the account cannot be reinstated, check with Global Support to confirm if the payment was received. As of January 2019, even failed Boleto payments should render in the UI, allowing SANOPs to process the refund. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Offline refund process workflow (teams and owners)</strong></p>

<p>This is an end-to-end documentation of the offline refund process for customers choosing a wire refund and SLA guidance below is for internal reference provided as a&nbsp;rough estimate of the internal processing time for each step. Processing of offline refunds varies widely, and a perfect&nbsp;end scenario may take&nbsp;an average of&nbsp;10 business days. This does not include dependencies on the customer to provide their personal information through MPC. Any SLA shared with customers should be given as a rough estimate only and times will vary widely depending on approvals required, customer action, country, and banking institution.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Following Safe Approval (step 6), it typically takes one week for most banks to process wire transfer refunds. (<strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;This is longer for emerging markets). After Safe Approval, check payments take anywhere from seven days to eight weeks to arrive, depending on the mailing system in the customer&rsquo;s country. Always set customer expectations that offline refunds take time, especially when payment is outside the United States. While wire refunds are faster, both payments require customer action via MPC, which can pose its own challenges for some customers. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Once SANOPs confirms that the MPC link has been sent to the customer, notify the customer that they will need to take action to complete the MPC details. For follow up with SANOPs:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If customer is requesting refund status, follow the steps below before escalating: </span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Confirm customer has received MPC email.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Confirm they have completed the MPC set up.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><a id="3.4" name="3.4"></a>3.4 Refund to online payment method declined</h4>

<p>If a credit memo is declined, the customer may be eligible for an offline refund.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Confirm the decline reason. Authorized users should access CMAT and search for the account transaction details.
	<ul>
		<li>If the timestamped transaction attempt matching the declined credit memo shows the Final Decision is &quot;bank declined&quot; the advertiser&#39;s bank rejected the refund, possibly because the account is closed. In this scenario, the customer is eligible for an offline refund.</li>
		<li>If the account is marked fraud, offline refunds for declined credit memos should not be processed unless approved by fraud. Cardholders should be redirected to dispute the charge with their bank. Otherwise, the customer may be required to submit a bank statement with the original transaction to prove eligibility for an offline refund.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If there is no rejection reason, there may be a status discrepancy between the Microsoft Advertising UI and the Commerce Platform (CP) through which all billing transactions occur. Escalate to Global Support to confirm whether funds were successfully transferred back to the customer&#39;s financial institution.</li>
	<li>If Global Support is unable to retry or reconcile the UI and CP statuses, request an offline refund via Escalation to your regional SANOPs alias. <strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Reference the Global Support ticket in the request.</li>
</ol>

<h4><a id="3.5" name="3.5"></a>3.5 Check refund status</h4>

<p>In some cases, a refund for a closed prepay account may be automatically issued back to the customer. There is no longer a need to validate whether the check has already been sent before submitting a new offline refund request, SANOPs will validate that the request is new upon receipt. You can expect their initial reply to confirm ability to process the refund within 48 hours.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>To update an already submitted request:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol style="list-style-type:decimal" type="1">
	<li><span><span><span><span>Search for the original ASD ticket.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Confirm </span></span></span></span>that all the information including the Advertiser Name, Account Number, and Company Code is accurate.</li>
	<li><span><span><span>Append the ticket, sending a follow up request to SANOPs</span></span></span>.</li>

<p>Before issuing a new refund request, always confirm the SLA&rsquo;s with the customer and validate that they have followed instructions in MPC (for bank transfer payments).</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>To reissue a check refund:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:decimal" type="1">

<h3><a id="4" name="4"></a>4. When to process rebills</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Like credits/refunds, Tier 1 support team should only process rebill adjustments <strong>under </strong>$10,000 USD or the market equivalent of Credit Level C. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Credits and rebill adjustments <strong>over </strong>$10,000 should be escalated to the regional SANOPs teams after TA approval per the Large/Aged Adjustments guidance below.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>A complete refund and rebill is required in several scenarios. All these scenarios are exempt from the normal 60-day refund policy and are still required even if the invoice is more than one&nbsp;year old or is triggering an &ldquo;invalid&rdquo; error upon adjustment.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>SAP ID Changes to the bill-to or sold-to and the bills need to change immediately.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The incorrect currency was set as part of the account setup, and the advertiser needs to correct this to pay the bill.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The customer resides in a market that charges VAT and did not have their VAT ID associated with their Microsoft Advertising account, so they were overcharged. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>SEPA credits/rebills should not be processed within eight&nbsp;weeks of the payment without TA approval. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>3.&nbsp;<a id="step 3" name="step 3"></a>Create a new campaign and ad group under the campaign for the rebill within the XID. Title this campaign/ad group &#39;Rebill&#39;. Make sure the IO and budget will accept debit and not auto credit or pause the account for delivery. Essentially this means that the daily limit must be set high enough to cover the rebill adjustment amount.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>4. Add keywords, and an ad to the ad group. As a best practice, use the word &#39;rebill&#39; or &#39;rebills&#39; for the keyword to quickly identify the ad and differentiate it from the other ads on the advertiser&#39;s account.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>5. Set the bids to the suggestions that Bing provides. <strong>Do not</strong>&nbsp;set the bids at an extremely high rate if not suggested by Bing.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>6.&nbsp;<a id="step 6" name="step 6"></a>Log out of corpnet. Search on Bing using one of the keywords that you applied. Find the ad and select on it. Log back on to corpnet.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: It can take up to three&nbsp;hours for the click to show in the Balance tab. If you don&#39;t see the click after three&nbsp;hours, click on the ad again.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>8. Once click shows in the Balance tab. Pause the campaign created for the rebill.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Debit/Rebill Charges</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>9. Locate the Ad Group created for the rebill as detailed in <a bookmark-id="step 3" href="#step 3" managed-link="">step 3</a> above.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1">10. Select the pencil icon in the <strong>New Adjustment</strong>&nbsp;column, next to the listed rebill Ad Group, edit any line items necessary, making sure to include amount, adjustment type, adjustment reason and comments on the adjustment.</p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>Note</strong>: For rebills, enter the adjustment amount in the <strong>New Adjustment Field</strong> &gt; select <strong>Debit in Adjustment Type</strong> drop down &gt; enter adjustment reason &lsquo;Account Setup Incorrectly&mdash;Incorrect Currency/Discount/SAP&rsquo; and finally detail adjustment comments.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>11. Select <strong>Save</strong>. This will generate a line item on the next billing statement/invoice to show the spend.

<p class="indent-2"><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Any credits or rebills over $10,000 should be sent to the ART team for complete processing.

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Sometimes a large rebill can cause a monthly invoice advertiser to go on credit hold. To prevent adverse impact to the customer&rsquo;s account while the rebill is underway, <strong>before processing the rebill</strong>, notify Post Collections of the circumstances and they can suspend all action on the account, which will allow the customer an additional two weeks to pay before resuming collections activities (including account holds). This notification should be done via a child ticket UCMT escalation:</span></span></span></span></span></p>
