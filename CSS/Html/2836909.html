<h4><a id="DigitalPartnerOfRecord" name="DigitalPartnerOfRecord">Digital Partner of Record</a></h4>

<p>Digital Partner of Record (DPOR, or POR) is an authorized Microsoft Partner, with a Silver or Gold Cloud Competency rating, that establishes a business relationship to help customers plan or implement Azure solutions on a specific subscription. Customers may request to have a DPOR added at a business relationship level to their subscription.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> A DPOR is not a Service Administrator or Co-Administrator and does not have any admin rights to the subscription. Also, DPOR is only available to OMS accounts, not MINT accounts. More information about Azure DPORs can be found on the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/partners/partner-of-record/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure Partner Incentives</a> page or in the <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/digital-partner-of-record#FAQ" target="_blank">DPOR FAQ</a>.</p>

<p>Customers can add a DPOR in the Account Portal by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Select an active subscription.</li>
	<li>Select <strong>Partner Information</strong>.</li>
	<li>Enter the <strong>Microsoft Partner ID</strong>.
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>The user will need the MPN Partner ID from their Partner or from the MPN admin in their company.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Once the DPOR has been added it may take up to one billing cycle (30 days) for the update to show on the account.</p>

<p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>Azure Government customers can perform the above operation in the <a href="https://portal.azure.us" managed-link="">Fairfax&nbsp;Management Portal</a>.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><a id="SkyKick Cloud Backup Offer" name="SkyKick Cloud Backup Offer"></a>SkyKick Cloud Backup Offer</strong></h4>

<p>Microsoft has included SkyKick as part of their IUR programs, which offers partners free SkyKick benefits. While all partners get a 30-day free trial for their customers, this IUR offer allows customers to back up their company&rsquo;s Office 365 Exchange, SharePoint, and OneDrive for Business data on Azure. Customers also receive unlimited retention, automated backup snapshots (up to 6 per day), and lightning fast search and restorations.</p>

<p>The Azure SkyKick Cloud Backup IUR offer is free for partners forever, but partners have to setup a backup subscription. More details can be found on the<a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/uspartner_ts2team/2015/12/31/microsoft-partner-azure-iur-skykick-cloud-backup-offer/"> </a><a href="https://www.skykick.com/msiur" target="_blank">Azure IUR SkyKick Cloud Backup Offer</a> web page.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>See the <a bookmark-id="Benefit assignment and activation" href="#Benefit assignment and activation" managed-link="">Benefit Activation Workflow</a> in the <a bookmark-id="Support Scenarios" href="#Support Scenarios" managed-link="">Support Scenarios</a> section below.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span><a id="AbouttheMPNPortal" name="AbouttheMPNPortal"></a>About the MPN Portal</span></h3>

<p><span>There are two MPN portals: </span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Classic / Partner Membership Center / PMC</span></li>
	<li><span>New / Partner Center / PC </span></li>
</ol>

<p><span>Starting in 2019, all new sign-ups happen in the Partner Center portal. Existing customers are migrated in phases from the Classic portal to the new portal. This is an automated activity and the order in which customers are transitioned cannot be changed. </span><br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong><span><a id="Differences Between the Old and the New Portal" name="Differences Between the Old and the New Portal"></a>Differences Between the Old and the New Portal</span></strong></h4>

<p><span>It is important to understand which portal the customer is using since the benefit activation workflow, benefit assignment, and troubleshooting steps are portal-specific. Only TAs can identify the customer&rsquo;s MPN portal version (Partner Membership Portal or Partner Center Portal) with the VMT/Prose tool. Ask your TA to validate which version of the portal applies to your scenario. The main difference between the two portals is that the Classic portal allows only MSA accounts to perform any activities, whereas the New portal allows only ORG accounts. </span></p>

			</ol>

			<p><strong>Note</strong>: Customers can remove or re-assign the MPN Action Pack to different users anytime in the Partner Portal. SEs should guide the customer through this process. If the customer encounters any issues in the Partner Portal during this process, the SE should engage the OneVL Team through their TA/PTA.</p>

			<p><strong>Note</strong>: Customers cannot remove or re-assign Silver or Gold Azure Benefits in the Partner Portal. SEs should take the following steps to assist customers who want to remove or re-assign Silver or Gold Azure Benefits:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Check if the user has an active Azure Internal Registration System (AIRS) entitlement and/or has an Azure Subscription.</li>
				<li>If the user meets the requirements listed in step 1, engage the Azure Sponsorship team to remove or transfer the AIRS Benefit to the requested user after receiving the necessary approval. Once the AIRS transfer is completed by the Azure Sponsorship team, move the existing Azure Sponsorship Subscriptions to the requested user and/or guide the user to create new Sponsorship Subscriptions.</li>
				<li><span><span><span>If the user does not meet the requirements in step 1, engage the OneVL Team to work with MPN Global Support to force the transfer of the benefit or re-trigger AIRS so that step 2 can be followed.</span></span></span></li>

			Customers may receive the following error message when trying to associate a partnerID to a subscription: <em>&quot;We don&#39;t have a record of this PartnerID. Validate and try again.&quot;.&nbsp;</em></p>

			<p><em>In these instances, you should do the following:&nbsp;</em></p>

					<li>You can validate this under <a href="https://ocpinsights.microsoft.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://ocpinsights.microsoft.com/</a>&nbsp;by Searching with the <em>Partner ID </em>and navigating to MPN Org Hierarchy section.</li>
					<li>Look for <em>Partner ID</em> under the <em>Org Type </em>set to &ldquo;Location&rdquo; and ensure customer is using the right one based on their desired location (as there may be multiple locations)</li>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>MPNID is missing &quot;Code 99&quot;</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>There is a known issue where the MPNID is valid, has Gold or Silver Cloud Competency, but is missing a property called &quot;Program Code 99&quot; in the MPNID records database. Program Code 99 is required to add the ID as the DPOR in the account portal.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Do the following in CMAT to identify if Code 99 is missing:</span></span></span></p>

			<ol>
				<li><span><span>Switch the CMAT template to </span></span><span>Office 365</span><span><span>.</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>Click the </span></span><span>MPN Partner ID</span><span><span> tab from the search query.</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>Enter the <strong>MPN ID</strong>.</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>Look for </span></span><span>Program Codes</span><span><span> under the <strong>Partner Information</strong> section.</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>If Code 99 is missing from the list, send an email to </span></span><span><span>partsup@microsoft.com</span></span><span><span> to have them add Code 99 to the MPN ID.</span></span></li>
			</ol>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Issues in the Account Portal</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>The customer tried to add a valid Partner ID and the error they receive is due to a problem in the Account portal. Before determining the error is due the portal, check for the following using the steps above:</span></span></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span>The MPN ID is valid</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>The MPN ID has the right Competency</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>Program Code 99 has been added</span></span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><span><span><span>Once these have been verified, collect the following data from the customer and open an IcM to the ASE team (see </span></span></span><span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3093263"><span><span>TSG 3093263</span></span></a></span><span><span>)</span></span><span><span><span>:</span></span></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span>A screenshot of the error: Include the whole screen showing the subscription details, login name, and the error.</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>A screenshot of the MPN portal showing the Partner ID is valid and has Silver or Gold Competency.</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>A network trace that captures the actions of your customer logging in to the Account portal. End the trace when the error message is received.</span></span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> For general MPN questions about the MPN ID, engage your TA. They will address your questions or direct you to the proper team for help.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><strong><span><span><span>Customer is unable to make the updates on their own</span></span></span></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>If the customer cannot make updates after troubleshooting with ASMS and needs ten or more subscriptions updated with a new DPOR, engage PayOps with the following information so they can make the bulk updates:</span></span></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span>Partner / Organization Name</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>Subscription IDs</span></span></li>
				<li><span><span>Corresponding tenant GUID</span></span></li>

		<li>Work with a TA, as they can engage the RSC team. They will get the required details for the customer and a contact from the MPN team if required.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>While transferring the MPN subscription from one account to another, does the destination account need to have benefits entitled?
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>Yes, so that the subscription does not get suspended when the BG runs an entitlement check.</li>
		<li>In certain cases, we can perform the SOT if the destination does not have the entitlement. Work with your TA to assess the situation before performing the SOT.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The customer is in the old MPN portal and has not been migrated to the new Partner Center portal. The MPN Action Pack Azure subscription is already active and they want to have it moved to another account. In this case it is an ORG account. What must be done to accomplish the transfer?
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>Work with a TA and they will advise accordingly.</li>
		<li>For more information, see the <em>Subscription Ownership Transfer (SOT) of MPN 25P</em> section above.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The customer has been migrated to the new portal and wants to transfer the existing Azure MPN subscription to a work account. How do we do this?
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>The new portal supports the addition of work accounts.</li>
		<li>Once the customer adds the desired work account or if the account has already been added, the subscription can be transferred from CMAT.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A customer who had an Azure MPN subscription under a work account has been migrated to the new Partner Center portal and wants to have it transferred to another work account from the same tenant. Can this be done and what is the process?
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li>Yes. The benefits from the current work account can be reassigned so that the Global Admin can assign the benefits to the desired account</li>
		<li>The subscription can then be transferred from CMAT.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>
