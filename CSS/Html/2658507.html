<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>In most cases, supporting indirect Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers involves many of the same processes as supporting direct EA customers. This article highlights the key differences between direct and indirect customers.<br>
<strong>Applies To: </strong>Azure indirect EA customers.</p>

<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<ul>
	<li>If partners are contacting ASMS directly, direct them to the <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/oas/?prid=14238">support link</a> in the upper right corner of the EA portal.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>For other issues not highlighted here, follow the process from existing EA TSGs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Indirect Customers</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>An indirect EA customer can be identified by the partner name below their company name.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Indirect customers must contact their partner for all billing, pricing, invoice, and credit scenarios.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Indirect customers must also contact their partner for usage credits, double billing, and proactively issued credits.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If your customer is an existing customer of a partner, provide them the name of the partner company and instruct them to escalate their issue with the partner.</li>
	<li>On the Azure Enterprise Portal (AEP), indirect customers cannot access the <strong>View Price Sheet</strong> or <strong>Usage Summary</strong> pages. They will instead be presented with a <strong>Service Usage Report</strong> view that does not include any pricing information.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Partner Price Markup</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Partner Price Markup is a feature that the partner must enable, but it is available. Until it is enabled, the indirect customer will not be able to view their cost information.</li>
	<li>EA indirect customers of Large Account Resellers (LARs) can only view pricing information when the Partner Price Markup feature is enabled. Then, when the customer downloads the Usage Data report, it will also include cost information.</li>
	<li>The Partner Price Markup feature allows Licensing Solution Providers (LSP) partner administrators to add a percentage markup to their indirect Enterprise Agreements.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <em>The Price Point Markup </em><em>PDF</em><em> is available to download from the portal by the </em><em>p</em><em>artner</em><em>. It is located</em><em> under the <strong>Help</strong> menu on </em><em>the </em><em>top right-hand side of the portal.</em></p>

<p><strong>Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA)</strong></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;<span>MPSA agreements are discontinued.</span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA) is an offer like EA where customers can access and manage their consumption through the EA portal. ASMS can assist with resending MPSA activation emails as with EA customers. MPSA could be described as regular EA with overage.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>MPSA customers get discounts like EA customers, but since they don&rsquo;t purchase any monetary commitments, they will always be indirect enrollments through their partners. Any consumption under these enrollments is invoiced as overage on a quarterly basis.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Account and enrollment transfers from MPSA-to-EA or EA-to-MPSA are performed using the same method as EA-to-EA.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Azure MPSA customers have an enrollment provision in the EA portal. Therefore, any customer is entitled to move from Pay-As-You-Go/Trial/Azure in Open to MPSA/EA in the usual way (adding the Account owner ID as a new account owner in the EA Portal, which allows for automatic conversion).&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>MPSA customers cannot have Marketplace deployments under their enrollment. However, they can have such deployments outside their enrollment.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Service Impacting Event (SIE)/credit/refund requests from MPSA customers should come from the partner. However, the process for handling&nbsp;EA SIE requests is the same. See <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/2872061" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2872061</a>&nbsp;for more guidance.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Credit-applied post invoices are generated for subscriptions under MPSA, so either the invoice is canceled and a new one is generated, or a credit memo is issued.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Direct MPSA customers should contact their assigned <strong>Microsoft Inside Sales Rep </strong>for any issues with ordering, licensing or billing.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>If the customer does not have an assigned Rep, they can contact the <strong>My Ops Team</strong> (<a href="mailto:myops@microsoft.com">myops@microsoft.com</a>) for further assistance.</li>
</ul>
