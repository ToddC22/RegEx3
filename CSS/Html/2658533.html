<ul>
	<li><span>EA customers are under very specific contracts which detail exactly how they can and cannot be compensated. Take extra care to stay In-Policy for cases involving EA customers.</span></li>
	<li><span>In-depth information about credit policies can be found in the <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/Azure%20Credit%20Policy%20Process%20and%20Controls%20ver%2024-Approved.pptx?d=w265fb55921454def8c46cc544ce7da44">Azure Credit Exception Policy PowerPoint deck</a>.</span></li>
	<li><span>If a customer is dissatisfied with a credit, ask them to contact their Technical Account Manager (TAM) or the Accounts team to further discuss their concerns.</span></li>
	<li><span>Because Marketplace purchases do not consume Monetary Commitment (MC), crediting Marketplace purchases requires the Enterprise Azure Operations (EAO) team to give the customer a credit note. </span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>Credit notes can only be applied to invoices, so in this situation the customer needs to wait for their invoice to be generated before the EAO team can be engaged.</span></li>
		<li><span>All of ASMS are&nbsp;empowered to create credits of up to $250 USD outside these policies (M1s up to $500)</span></li>
		<li><span>If there is a strong justification to go beyond our policies (including executive escalations) for a higher amount, the TA/Manager should engage the EAO team.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>If a customer asks to be connected to the EAO team, inform them that the EAO team is not customer-facing and that you will engage them as needed on behalf of the customer.<span> </span><span> </span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="Engaging the Enterprise Azure Operations Team for Credit Requests" name="Engaging the Enterprise Azure Operations Team for Credit Requests"></a>Engaging the Enterprise Azure Operations Team for Credit Requests</h4>

<p>The EAO team reviews TFS tickets to verify the <a href="http://aka.ms/AzureCreditPolicy" managed-link="" target="_blank">credit reason codes</a> (CRC) and the policies referenced. Follow the guidelines outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4094770">TSG 4094770</a> to engage the EAO team via TFS for credits.</p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> The Service Level Agreement (SLA) for the EAO team to reply to a TFS ticket is 2-3 business days. All credits and refunds must be sent to the EAO team (via TFS) for processing.</p>

<p>All tickets sent to the EAO team must include a CRC. Use <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3045635/azure-support---credit-reason-codes">TSG 3045635</a> to determine the correct CRC.</p>

<p>Credit empowerments must follow credit policy refund limits. For good will and surprise bill scenarios, we can provide <em><span>only</span></em> 60 days of credit, or 120 days for Service Impacting Event (SIE) scenarios.</p>

<p>All credit requests must be submitted within 120 days of the service impact dates.</p>

<p><strong><span>SIE credits:</span></strong> A technical evaluation is required to check whether a specific customer is affected by a SIE, even if the SIE is reported in the Service Health Dashboard. This is because some customers have repeatedly taken advantage of the Dashboard information to claim credits for SIEs that did not actually affect them.</p>

<h4>Acknowledging Customer Requests and Setting Expectations Regarding Communication Frequency</h4>

<p>Inform the customer that you are collaborating with an internal partner team, and that <span>it may take at least 3-5 business days</span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span> to find a resolution. If the customer&rsquo;s Account Team TAM is unknown, assist the customer in getting that information from <a href="https://www.explore.ms/">Explore.ms</a>. For more information about Explore.ms, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4463565">TSG 4463565</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="Customer Experience and Provisioning" name="Customer Experience and Provisioning"></a>Customer Experience and Provisioning</h3>

<p>Customers with Azure EA agreements receive special pricing, with special <span>stock keeping units</span><span> </span><span> </span> (SKUs) created for the base commitment, as well as for overages if the commitment amount is used up before the end of the calendar year.</p>

<p>The pricing sheet for an enrollment is available to customers on that enrollment in the EA portal. The <strong><span>View Price Sheet</span></strong> <span>tab</span><span> </span><span> </span> shows the pricing sheet and defines all SKUs used by the customer for billing purposes. Direct customers can also edit the pricing for their own indirect customers.</p>

<p>More information about the Partner Price Markup can be found <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/LegacyUploaded_BemisRepository/Bemis/BemisUploadedFiles/BemisDocuments/302/bemisdocuments/Commerce/Weblinks%20for%20Commerce%20TSGs/PartnerPriceMarkup.pdf">here</a>. (PDF)<span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>

<p>EA agreements are set up in the EA Regional Operations Centers (EA ROC) with pricing specific to each customer contract. If the customer notices that SKUs or Prices are missing or incorrect compared to their contract, they should engage their Partner or Software Advisor to contact the EA ROC.</p>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<p>Questions from customers regarding their bill can come through two different teams, <strong>ASMS</strong> and <strong>EA ROC</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>If your customer disagrees with their bill and wants a credit:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Look up the customer&rsquo;s account in the Azure Enterprise Portal (AEP) using the <strong>Search </strong><strong>function</strong>.

	<ul>
		<li>For more information, please see the EA Eligibility Check TSG (<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658469">TSG 2658469</a>).</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Select your customer from the search results.</li>
	<li>In the <em>Reports</em> area, go to <strong>Usage</strong><strong> Summary</strong>.</li>
	<li>Verify the specific billing issue with the customer.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>If your customer is dissatisfied with their service and wants a credit (includes SIE credits):</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>Look up the customer&rsquo;s account in AEP using the <strong>Search </strong><strong>function</strong>.</li>
	<li>Verify the specific service issue with your customer.</li>
	<li>Check your customer&rsquo;s usage in the Enterprise portal.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>To</strong><strong> calculate the claim amount:</strong></p>

<p>Wait until the end of the current billing cycle so that credits are not calculated until the outage month closes (typically between the 6th and 10th of the following month). The available credit is dependent on when the outage occurred, so check Jarvis for specific outage details before continuing.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the service outage was between the guaranteed SLA uptime and 99% availability, then the credit is <strong>10%</strong> of the service used amount for the entire month.</li>
	<li>If the service outage dropped service availability below 99%, then a credit of <strong>25%</strong> of the service used amount for the entire month is provided.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="Calculate the Credit Amount According to the Posted SLAs" name="Calculate the Credit Amount According to the Posted SLAs"></a>Calculate the Credit Amount According to the Posted SLAs</h4>

<p>After determining the correct percentage for the SLA credit, calculate the total charge on the account by downloading usage details for that month from the EA Portal. Determine whether to apply the credit to the entire invoice charge or to a specific service based on what services were impacted.</p>

<p><strong>Calculating the SLA credits for EA customers:</strong></p>

<p>SLA Credit must be calculated based on Service Type, Service Tier or Service Instances, depending on what MSFT Engineering Team confirms the impact:</p>

<div>
<ul>
	<li>If the Engineering Team or CSS confirms that the impact was at the Subscription level, meaning that all services under the subscription were impacted, we will calculate the SLA Credit for all of the subscription consumption.</li>
	<li>If Engineering Team / CSS confirms that the imapct was just a specific Service tier, or that just a specific Service Instance that was impacted, we will calculate the SLA Credit only for the Service Tiers or Service Instances impacted.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<ol>
	<li>Download the <strong><span>Usage Data</span></strong> for the month of the outage from the EA Portal as an .xlsx file.</li>
	<li>Open the file in Excel and click the <strong><span>Enable Editing</span></strong> button.</li>
	<li>Open a new tab.</li>
	<li>Insert a pivot table.</li>

	<li>Add the words <strong>Pre-approved</strong> in the title if you or the TA/M1 has already approved the credit to speed up processing. You must note who has approved this credit.</li>
	<li>The EAO team will apply the credit and note it in the TFS ticket. If necessary, the EAO team will work with the EA ROC.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Where will direct customers see their SLA credit?</strong></p>

<p>In Volume Licensing (VL), direct customers will receive a credit note on their account. <span>They will receive a Statement of Account email once per month. </span> The credit will appear as a negative amount with a credit memo reference number.&nbsp;(See&nbsp;<strong>Figure 1</strong>.)</p>

<p><span asset="4467441" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4467441]</span></p>

<p><strong>Figure 1. Statement of Account.</strong></p>

<p>This reference number is displayed on the credit memo (Figure 2) that the customer receives from the Operations team.</p>

<p><strong>Where will indirect customers see their credit memo?</strong></p>

<p>In VL for indirect customers, the credit will be provided to the Partner as a credit note. The partner is responsible for ensuring that the credit is passed on to the customer.</p>

<p>The credit memo will contain additional details of the SLA Credit such as <strong><span>Credit Type</span></strong>, <strong><span>Original Invoice Number</span></strong>, Service Request number (<strong><span>SR#</span></strong>), and the <strong><span>date of the outage</span></strong>. (See <strong><span>Figure 2</span></strong>.)</p>

<p><span asset="4467440" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4467440]</span></p>

<p><strong>Figure 2. Credit Memo</strong></p>

<p><strong>Credit Utilization</strong></p>

<p>When the customer receives the credit note, they can offset the credit against any existing invoices on their account, up to the amount of the credit note. This does not have to be the original invoice to which the credit note was added. Customers are encouraged to use their credits, either via invoice offset or refund, within 90 days from date of credit issuance. Global Financial Services (GFS) (formerly known as <em>Global Credit Services (GCS)</em> or <em>Worldwide Online Credit Services (WOCS)</em>)&nbsp;will guide customers throughout the credit clearing process.</p>

<h3><a id="Engagement and Escalation Path" name="Engagement and Escalation Path"></a>Engagement and Escalation Path</h3>

<h4><strong><span>Finding the Enrollment number for an EA customer:</span></strong></h4>

<ol>
	<li>Use the company name listed in CMAT or in the customer&rsquo;s signature.</li>
	<li>If you are still unable to find the Enrollment number, try searching the domain in CMAT.</li>
	<li>If the company name has multiple words, try searching for individual words.</li>
	<li>If the steps above fail, ask the customer.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Escalations to Enterprise Azure Operations team</strong></p>

<p>For Credits or Refunds engage the EAO team via a TFS ticket, following the instructions in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4094770">TSG 4094770</a>.</p>

<p>Use the following process to determine whether a credit approval should be sent to the EAO team.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Do the services listed match the verbatim statement given by the customer?</li>
	<li>Does the customer&rsquo;s verbatim statement make sense on its own?</li>
	<li>What is the issue from the customer&rsquo;s perspective?</li>
	<li>Why did the issue happen?
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Include Root Cause Analysis (RCA) or other technical assessment details.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Who is at fault: Microsoft or the customer?
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>If Microsoft, objective evidence from a technical source in Support is needed.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>What was the impact on the customer? How did it specifically affect them?</li>
	<li>What times and dates did the issue occur?
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Include times up to the minute if possible.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>What services were impacted?</li>
	<li>Provide a readable (not too technical), high-level explanation of the impact on the customer so that the approval is handled effectively.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span>Verify Whether Credits Have Been Applied</span></strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Access the enrollment in the EA portal.</span></li>
	<li><span>Click <strong><span>Reports</span></strong>.</span></li>
	<li><span>Click <strong><span>Usage Summary</span></strong> and switch to <em><span>Monthly</span></em> view.</span></li>
	<li><span>The credit amount is shown as <strong>Adjustments</strong> with a short description. Hover over the dollar amount to see a more detailed description of the credit.</span><br>
	<span><strong>Note: </strong>These Adjustments will expire when the current anniversary term ends. If the current billing cycle is the last one of the current anniversary term,&nbsp;add the Adjustment to the first month of the next anniversary term by requesting so in the EA TFS ticket.</span></li>
