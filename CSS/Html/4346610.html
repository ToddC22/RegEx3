<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This procedure is to be used&nbsp;when assistance is required to progress, a case, either across technology or within the same technology. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Collaboration is when one engineer requests another engineer with a different skillset to help solve a customer issue. When implemented through current case management tools, collaboration requires dispatching an object to a queue.</p>

<p><strong>When to Swarm or Collaborate?</strong></p>

<p>Use <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4464163" target="_blank">4464163 Procedure: Swarming</a> to step through the collaboration procedure &nbsp;in real time with engineers that support a different but relevant technology, where available. Work with the engineer to assist case progression while retaining ownership and managing the customer experience end-to-end.</p>

<p>If swarming does not enable real time collaboration with engineers in the relevant technology, or that technology is not enabled for cross-technology swarming, then continue with collaboration procedure below.</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: When should I use the Assistance feature?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: When you need to collaborate with someone and don&rsquo;t know the collaborative engineer&rsquo;s name.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: Can I use the Assistance feature to request assistance from a specific engineer rather than a team?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: Currently no. When you request assistance, you specify a team. Any user who has the appropriate skills will see the assistance case and will be able to accept it.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: How many people can I request assistance from at one time on a ticket?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: There is no limit. You can request assistance from as many teams as needed.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: When I create an Assistance request, is there another ticket number?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: From the Rave side, there&rsquo;s just one case number. This case will appear in the My cases view for the case owner and any user who has accepted the case to provide assistance.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">From the SD side, there will be a SD case and a corresponding Rave case (the numbers will be different).&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: What skills will a user need to see assistance cases?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: There is no additional skill required. All users can see assistance cases. However, you must have the appropriate skills to see the case. For example, if the case is a Premier Escalation case and the case owner needs assistance from the EnterpriseOneDrive team, you will need to have both the Premier Escalation and EnterpriseOneDrive skills to see the case. The same is true for the language of the case.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: What case information will a user see when they accept an Assistance case?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: The full Rave case history can be found in Rave.&nbsp; However, if the request is initiated from SD, the case communication will be copied from SD case to Rave case and also whatever was written in the SD collaboration task will show up in the Assistance Request Description filed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
<span asset="4498795" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4498795]</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: How can I tell which cases I own vs. those for which I&rsquo;m providing assistance?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: In your My cases view, you&rsquo;ll see the blue <strong>ASSISTANCE</strong> stamp on cases for which you are providing assistance.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: How can I tell who the main case owner is?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: The case owner (agent) is displayed in the Case Summary pane.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: How can I tell if my assistance request has been accepted?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: The Assistance pane will show the name of the user who has accepted the assistance request.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: What happens if I close the case before the Assistance case has been closed?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: Rave won&rsquo;t allow the case to be closed until the Assistance case has been closed.</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">SD cases CAN be closed with an open Rave assistance request. </span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: Can I </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB">transfer or </span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB">reassign an Assistance Request that I accepted?</span></strong></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span lang="EN-GB">A: Yes, the Assistance Request owner can transfer or re-assign the current Assistance Request to another Support area or Agent by clicking on</span>&nbsp;<strong>Update</strong> button in the Assistance pane.&nbsp;In order to reassign an Assistance Request to another user, you need to have one of the following roles (Premier Lead, Group Admin, Site Admin) and be within the same Rave org as the Assistance request. Requests for Service Desk users are sent to support areas within the CSS-C&amp;AI Rave organization, so users within Modern Workplace will not be able to assign requests to Service Desk users.<span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: Can I accept or make update to the Unassigned Assistance Requests?</span></strong></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span lang="EN-GB">A: Yes, </span>an&nbsp;<strong>Accept</strong> or <strong>Update</strong>&nbsp;button in the Assistance pane allows users to&nbsp;<strong>Accept or Update</strong>&nbsp;the assistance request by moving the request to another support area or assigning it to a user. In order to reassign an Assistance Request to another user, you need to have one of the following roles (Premier Lead, Group Admin, Site Admin) and be within the same Rave org as the Assistance request. Requests for Service Desk users are sent to support areas within the CSS-C&amp;AI Rave organization, so users within Modern Workplace will not be able to assign requests to Service Desk users.</p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can a Collaboration Task from SD be rerouted to update Assistance Request support area in Rave?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>A: No, updating the Collaboration Task from Windows to Office as an example will not work in Assistance Request in Rave. A new Collaboration Task for Office should be created in order to have a proper Assistance Request generated in Rave. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: What notifications will I see?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: You can see when an Assistance case has been accepted or closed by looking in the Assistance pane. You can see when case notes have been updated by checking the case communication history.</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB">Q: Is the Assistance feature available for all users?</span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">A: Assistance Request is available to all support, however O365 Broad Commercial&nbsp;support engineers can accept RA, but not submit a RA.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Some US Government cases will route to the Azure CXP ACE team initially. At times the Azure CXP ACE may need technical expertise from a CSS engineer to solve their customers problems. When this happens the ACE engineer will open a new case (just like a normal customer would), that CSS will use to provide assistance. These customers have special confidentiality agreements that require CSS to proceed as explained below.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Expectations for these cases:</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Cases will be created as a generic customer and will have the Azure CXP ACE engineer as the primary customer contact (contact details).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Cases will be identified as being an assistance request from Azure CXP ACE and contain a reference to this knowledge article.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Cases will include the question or information the ACE Engineer needs.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Cases will include limited information about the issue and the real customer behind the questions &ndash; ACE will determine what information can be shared.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Case severity will be set based on the customer scenario, so respect the severity and response SLAs accordingly &ndash; only ACE will have full details of the customer scenario.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Cases will be used for a single request for assistance &ndash; they will not be kept open to ask questions for different customer engagement that ACE is handling.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Customer data expectations:</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>No information about the real customer and its cloud subscription/tenant will be available to CSS in Service Desk. This means that tools that rely on customer accounts like ASC will not be usable.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Some data that comes from the technology itself can be shared. Example: Error messages, the status of a field in a log file, etc.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can engage other CSS engineers to help with the collaboration case. Any data that is shared in the case to CSS can be shared with any engineer in CSS necessary to address the question from ACE.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span><span>Expectations for the CSS Engineer:</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Treat these cases as you would cases from an external customer. This will impact case prioritization, labor logging, and what channels you respond with.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Answer questions to the best of your ability. Keep your mindset on walking the Azure CXP ACE through your troubleshooting steps. Provide guidance and suggestions for next steps and things the ACE should look for.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do not ask questions about the customer themselves.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do ask about the technical errors being encountered, and specific results that may be seen in a log file.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Example: You advise the ACE Engineer to access ASC for the customer account, run a specific test, and let you know the results.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Do share data queries that need to be performed with the ACE engineer.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Example: You need to know a specific result from a Kusto query, so you share it with the ACE engineer that works with the customer to generate the additional data needed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If you do not hear from the ACE engineer or feel the severity has been set incorrectly, do not contact the account&rsquo;s IM. Instead contact the ACE OneGov Leads team: &lt;</span></span></span></span><span><span><a href="mailto:aceonegovleads@microsoft.com" target="_blank" title="mailto:aceonegovleads@microsoft.com"><span><span><span>aceonegovleads@microsoft.com</span></span></span></a></span></span><span><span><span><span>&gt;.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Once you have helped, get confirmation the ACE Engineers question are answered, then close the case.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>You will not be asked to submit an ICM escalation to engineering nor participate in a root cause analysis.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: Collaboration is when one engineer requests another engineer with a different skillset to help solve a customer issue. When implemented through current case management tools, collaboration requires dispatching an object to a queue.</p>

<p>Swarming is a method of collaboration, established in real time, that enables multiple engineers with different skill sets to work together as a virtual-team to solve a customer issue.</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>A: Swarming should be the preferred method of collaboration for all situations where there is a live customer issue and a customer waiting for resolution. Swarming enables a shift in Microsoft support where customers don&rsquo;t need to wait for the right engineer to be found, but instead engineers with the right skillset are engaged in real-time to immediately continue solving the customer issue.</p>
