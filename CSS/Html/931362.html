You may have to ask the customer to try to start the program again to reproduce the problem. If the customer does see the Program Compatibility Assistant this means that the Application Compatibility testing that was completed by Microsoft has determined that the program will not work correctly in Windows Vista. The Program Compatibility Assistant may generate either a &quot;hard block&quot; or a &quot;soft block.&quot;<ul class='sbody-free_list'><li><span class='text-base'>Hard Block</span><br><br>A hard block occurs when the Program Compatibility Assistant is aware of an issue with the program that will leave Windows Vista in a damaged state if installation continued. When a hard block occurs, installation cannot continue. Instruct the customer to click <strong class='uiterm'>Check for solutions</strong> to obtain information about the next steps they can take to troubleshoot the issue. Advise the customer to follow those steps to resolve the issue. Typically, those steps involve obtaining an update or a newer version of the program from the Independent Software Vendor (ISV). Refer the customer to their ISV for additional support. <br></li><li><span class='text-base'>Soft Block</span><br><br>A soft block occurs if there is a known issue with the program when it is running under Windows Vista. The soft block will notify you that the program may not work as expected with Windows Vista. You can click <strong class='uiterm'>Run Program</strong> to continue to install the program. However, the software will likely not function correctly after it is installed. Instruct the customer to click <strong class='uiterm'>Check for solutions</strong> for more information about the next steps that they can take to troubleshoot the issue. Advise the customer to follow those steps to resolve the issue. Typically, those steps require that the customer obtains an update of the program or a newer version of the program from the ISV. Refer the customer to the ISV for additional support. <br></li></ul>If the program does not install after you follow the steps in the &quot;Support Agent Directions&quot; section, go to the &quot;Run the program installer in compatibility mode&quot; section. </div><div class='kb-moreinformation-section section'>To troubleshoot a program that does not run as expected after it is installed or to troubleshoot a program that produces an error message after it is installed, use the following advanced troubleshooting methods.<h4 class='sbody-h4'>Method 1: Disable Aero Glass when you run the program </h4>In some cases, a program may not be compatible with the new Desktop Window Manager and Aero Glass functionality in Windows Vista. Symptoms that indicate that a program is incompatible with Aero Glass include any of the following:<ul class='sbody-free_list'><li> A flickering screen<br></li><li> Desktop and window artifacts</li><li>A program window not painting correctly on the screen</li><li>A program window not painting at all and possibly causing a black window</li></ul>To determine whether the program compatibility issue is related to Aero Glass,  follow these steps: <ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <strong class='uiterm'>Start </strong><img class="graphic" src="/library/images/support/kbgraphics/public/en-us/vistastartbutton.jpg" alt="Start button " title="Start button ">,  and then type the name of the program in the <strong class='uiterm'>Start Search</strong> box.</li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>Programs</strong> list, right-click the program that you are troubleshooting, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Properties</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong class='uiterm'>Compatibility</strong> tab, click to select the <strong class='uiterm'>Disable desktop composition</strong> check box. </li></ol>When you select the <strong class='uiterm'>Disable desktop composition</strong> option in the program properties, Windows Vista disables Aero Glass every time that you run the program. Aero Glass is re-enabled when the program is closed.<br><br>If the program still does not work correctly, go to  the next method. <h4 class='sbody-h4'>Method 2: Run the program in safe mode</h4><span class='text-base'>Note</span> To start the computer in safe mode, press the F8 key while the computer is starting. You must press the F8 key  before the Windows Vista progress indicator appears.<br><br>To determine whether the issue that occurs with the program is caused by another program that is running in the background, we recommend that you restart the computer in safe mode and then test the program. If the program runs correctly in safe mode, but does not run correctly in normal mode, there likely is another program that is conflicting with the program in question. <br><br>To determine which program is causing a conflict with the program in question, we recommend that you perform a &quot;clean boot&quot; of the computer.  A clean boot is intended to disable as many background services and programs as possible. This helps determine which service or program may  be causing the problem.<span>For more information about how to perform a clean boot for troubleshooting, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br><br><div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-6' href='/en-us/help/929135'>929135 </a> How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista<br><br></div></span>If the program still does not work correctly, go to the next method.<h4 class='sbody-h4'>Method 3: Repair the program installation</h4><span class='text-base'>Note</span> Before you repair the program,  we recommend that you create a System Restore Point.

In some case, activation may be unsuccessful if the software vendor disallows installation under a new operating system. Activation is a process that makes sure that the software that you are using is licensed to run on the computer where it is installed.  Typically, activation requires that the software vendor’s Web site is contacted over the Internet to verify the validity of the program installation. Contact the software vendor if you have any questions about the activation process for the software vendor&#39;s program.<br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span> You may be prompted to enter a code that was provided by the software manufacture.<br><br>If the program still does not run correctly after you follow these steps, the program may not be compatible with Windows Vista.</div><div class='kb-moreinformation-section section'><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Support Agent Directions</h3><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Contact the Consult line for an Escalation Approval if the customer has already visited the software vendor for support and has been referred back to Microsoft</h4>As part of the customer&#39;s troubleshooting, if the customer has already visited the software vendor for support and was referred back to Microsoft, contact the Consult line, and ask whether the issue should be escalated.
