	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>The business location is the country or region that an advertiser&rsquo;s business is legally registered. If the customer is an agency, then it is the region where their client is legally registered.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Based on the business location, the customer might be required to pay tax on their advertising charges. Although this applies mostly to customers in Europe, <strong>all customers </strong>need to verify their business location, for each of their accounts. This is so that we can ensure that customers aren&rsquo;t erroneously taxed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>As of January 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019, customers must have complete Account Business Location (ABL)<strong> </strong> details in their details and a tax ID, or risk deactivation of their account due to eNF failure. </span></span></span></span></span>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>There are two unique tax statuses in Brazil which are self-proclaimed by our Microsoft Advertising Advertisers: Business and Personal. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Regardless of tax status, all Brazilian customers will be charged ISS tax on all invoice transactions (prepay, threshold and monthly invoice) as of the effective date. To successfully generate an eNF, we must have complete and accurate address details for all customers. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The difference is whether a valid tax ID must be provided.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Business customers are <strong>required</strong> to provide a registered business tax ID (CNPJ).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft will ship invoice transaction details to City Hall daily and eNFs are expected to be returned and linked to the Microsoft Advertising Billing grid within about 48 hours, although there is no published SLA with City Hall.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="4.3" name="4.3"></a>4.3 eNF | Customer specific or Microsoft General eNF</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Brazilian government introduced new legislation at the end of January 2018 to assist service providers in the transition period to the ISS law for online advertising. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The new legislation <em>Instru&ccedil;&atilde;o Normativa 22/17</em> [IN 22/17] allows service providers to submit <strong>one monthly</strong> general eNF to City Hall for all invoice transactions from February 13<sup>th</sup>, 2018 through&nbsp;December 31<span><span><span><span><span><sup>st</sup></span></span></span></span></span>, 2018. Brazil Tax and Compliance agree that Microsoft Advertising should proceed in a hybrid manner.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Customer Specific eNF</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Microsoft Advertising will respect the original legislation where possible and generate the Customer specific eNF when complete and accurate address and tax ID details are provided.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Microsoft General eNF</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: For those accounts with incomplete or inaccurate customer details, Microsoft Advertising will send those invoice transactions to City Hall on a General Monthly MSFT eNF.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Customers invoices that are covered in the General Monthly MSFT eNF will <strong>not</strong> receive an individual eNF and this is supported through the above legislation IN22/17. <strong>If a customer specific eNF is requested</strong> by the customer, we will <strong>not</strong> supply one to them. Based on the IN22/17, the individual eNFs will be <strong>replaced</strong> by the monthly general eNF.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Business</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> customers are more likely to request the customer specific eNF as they are traditionally required to present their eNF to their tax authorities. Since the government published legislation IN 22/17, they are aware that the customers may have a reconciliation gap. Customers may choose to supply the Microsoft Advertising commercial invoice as IN 22/17 is the legal basis to support this.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Personal</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> customers are less likely to request and require the customer specific eNF as they are not required to present their eNF to their tax authorities. Brazil does provide a unique opportunity to Personal customers where <strong>if </strong>they are registered with City Hall, they are entered in a lottery, and if they win the lottery they can reclaim their taxes paid from City Hall.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Once rendered, eNFs can be electronically cancelled if a full adjustment is processed within the grace period. Partial adjustments do not affect eNFs, nor will any other tax document be generated. Advertisers should use the original eNF generated for all tax and accounting purposes and consult with their local tax authority with further questions. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>SAP Monthly invoice grace period</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> is through the final calendar day of the month that the Microsoft Advertising invoice was generated.<strong> </strong>For example,<strong> </strong>an invoice that was generated on March 1</span></span></span><sup><span><span><span>st</span></span></span></sup><span><span><span>, 2018 must have the cancellation requested and full credit processed in Microsoft Advertising by March 31</span></span></span><sup><span><span><span>st</span></span></span></sup><span><span><span>, 2018.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Prepay and </span></span></span>Threshold invoice grace period</strong>&nbsp;is the 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;calendar day of the month following the invoice generation. For example, a prepay invoice that was generated on March 29<sup>th</sup>, 2018 must have the cancellation requested and full credit processed in Microsoft Advertising by April 5<sup>th</sup>, 2018.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Manual cancellation of an eNF is only possible outside of the grace period once the full value is credited. Send the following information to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:brzfisca@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">brzfisca@microsoft.com</a>: customer-specified cancellation reason, eNF#, customer name, customer address (ABL), and taxID (CPF/CNPJ).

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Notes</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>It may take up to one year for S&atilde;o Paulo City Hall to review and approve a manual eNF cancellation request. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>There is no guarantee the request will be approved. </span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>CPOM, short for <em>Cadastro de Empresas Fora do Munic&iacute;pio</em>, which is Portuguese for Register of Companies from Other Municipalities, is a mandatory registration for legal entities that provide services and issue </span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://thebrazilbusiness.com/article/the-difference-between-recibo-and-nota-fiscal" managed-link="" target="_blank">invoices or equivalent documents</a><span><span><span> in a different city from where the company is legally established.

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customers requesting reimbursement for tax submitted directly to their municipality must provide their tax certificate/receipt as reasonable proof of eligibility for reimbursement.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Only BR WHT reimbursements may be processed directly in the UI as an <em>activity </em>adjustment for the full amount of the tax withheld by the customer. </span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft accepts the risk that activity adjustments for tax purposes will be slightly higher due to the application of tax on the amount adjusted (for example, a 10 BRL adjustment value will process with an additional 2.99% tax on the adjustment, resulting in 10.299 BRLs to return to the customer). </span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising is required to charge a Goods and Services Tax (GST) on all search advertising costs in India at the current local tax rate. This tax is applied to all billing documents beginning July 1</span></span><sup><span><span>st</span></span></sup><span><span>, 2017. If customers in this market are seeking tax exemption approval (Special Economic Zone (SEZ) exemption <strong>or</strong> Withholding Tax exemption (WHT)) in this market, all requests must go through SANOPS.

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="6.2" name="6.2"></a>6.2 India e-invoice</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For businesses located in India, changes to billing documents are occurring as of October 1<sup>st</sup>, 2020, as required by the Government of India for e-invoicing.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><strong><span><span><span><span>QR code: </span></span></span></span></strong><span><span>Each <span><span>billing document will contain a QR (Quick Response) code that can be scanned to display the details of a billing document on a separate mobile or tablet device. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><strong><span><span><span><span>IRN: </span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>If you provide a Goods and Services Tax Identification Number (GSTIN), we&rsquo;ll supply a government issued Invoice Reference Number (IRN) on your billing document.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>All customers in India will encounter system validation to ensure their</span></span></strong><span><span><span><span> business address in Microsoft Advertising matches the registered address on their GSTIN. The first two digits of the customers GSTIN should also match the first two digits of the state code. If there is a mismatch between their complete address (including PIN) and the registered address on their GSTIN, then </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>won&rsquo;t be able to issue a government approved tax invoice.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<div class="col-xs-24">
<p><span><span><span><span>These official tax documents (called an e-invoice) are possible with the help of India government records validation. The validated IRN (tax number) and QR code make the tax document unique and only available when validation successfully occurs between the customer entered data points in the Microsoft Ads platform (customers GSTIN tax ID and business entity) and what is on file with the India government. Once validation is successful, an e-invoice is successfully rendered in the tax documents section of the billing grid. If an e-invoice fails, the validation was not successful (for example, a mismatch between what&rsquo;s entered in the UI and what is on file with the India government) and the customer will have an option to update the UI details to fix it. </span></span></span><span> </span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>There are four potential statuses in the UI for tax invoices:</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><strong><span><span>Available</span></span></strong><span><span> &ndash; e-invoice generated successfully.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><strong><span><span>Pending</span></span></strong><span><span> &ndash; e-invoice is awaiting generation and should be available soon.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><strong><span><span>Failed</span></span></strong><span><span> &ndash; occurs when an update needs to occur in the UI via the &lsquo;fix it&rsquo; link (due to missing or incorrect tax details).</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><strong><span><span>Failed</span></span></strong><span><span> &ndash; this status can remain following completion of the &lsquo;fix it&rsquo; workflow, while system is awaiting new invoice generation.</span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span>How to identify and resolve failures due to incorrect tax ID&rsquo;s or ABL details:</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Depending on the advertiser&rsquo;s payment method, the success, failure, and resolution of failed e-invoices will differ. Always check the customer payment method to determine how to assist with resolution:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Postpay threshold:</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>When a billing document is issued a incorrect or mismatched tax ID or business location details, it will result in failed status with a &lsquo;fix it&rsquo; link.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>The &lsquo;fix it&rsquo; link will take the client to update their tax ID or ABL details. Once updated, the system will automatically do a credit and rebill.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: The tax document will still show as &lsquo;failed&rsquo;, but the &lsquo;fix it&rsquo; link will disappear.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Once complete, a credit memo will be generated, along with a rebilled billing document and tax document.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Prepay (online payment method):</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><span><span><span>Tax validation occurs when a client attempts to add their funds. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If an account has an incorrect tax ID or business location, they will not be able to add funds until the mismatch is fixed.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If the tax ID or business location does not match, auto-recharge will be disabled.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>There will be no failed tax documents for online prepay customers due to these preventative measures.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Prepay (offline payment method):</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><span><span><span>With offline payments (such as, check or wire), there is no online tax validation.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Once the offline payment is received and posted to the account, tax validation takes place.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>If the tax ID or business location does not match, the tax document will have a failed status and &lsquo;fix it&rsquo; link.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>The &lsquo;fix it&rsquo; link will take the client to update the tax ID or ABL.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Once updated, the message will change, telling the client to &lsquo;Contact Support for assistance&rsquo;.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>CSS will need to manually initiate a credit for offline payment methods, resulting in a credit memo for the offline payment.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Once the credit memo has generated, CSS should request that CASHAPPS reapply funds (as identified by the credit memo). As an alternate, the customer can obtain an offline refund (via SANOPS). </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Reminder: To request reapplication of funds from CASHAPPS, use UCMT. This team does not get a lot of requests of this nature, so be clear in your request by:</span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span>Clearly stating your subject line: Reapply offline payment to Microsoft Advertising customer account.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Always include the customer&rsquo;s account number, amount, credit memo, and note the original form of payment (check/wire).</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Explain that a refund occurred but the customer desires to reapply the prepaid funds to their account.</span></span></span></span></li>

		<li><span><span><span><span>Escalate to your TA if there are issues or complications with this process beyond four day SLA.</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Monthly invoice:</span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Monthly invoice customers will be validated similarly to postpay threshold.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>When a billing document is issued, incorrect or mismatched tax ID or business location details will result in failed status with a &lsquo;fix it&rsquo; link.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The &lsquo;fix it&rsquo; link will take the client to update their tax ID or ABL details. Once updated, the fix it link will disappear.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The credit memo and rebilled document will <strong>not</strong> appear until the 1<sup>st </sup>or 2<sup>nd</sup> day of the following billing month (just like standard invoice billing).</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>From the adjustment tab, internal users will see that the invoice has a credit and rebill pending.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="6.3" name="6.3"></a>6.3 Request for tax reimbursement</h4>

<p><span><span><span>There are special circumstances for India where customers may request tax reimbursement from Microsoft. Validation of such requests must be done via SANOPS. This can require extensive SLA&rsquo;s given nuances in market and lack of systematic process to validate and provide such refunds. Never promise tax refunds in advance of validation and authorization. Once a tax refund has been authorized and approved, determine how the advertiser prefers to receive the refund. It could be in the form of a credit in UI or require a credit/rebill. For questions or concerns with how to issue such refunds, refer to the tax authority (via SANOPS) or your TA: <strong>Pre/post-pay customers &ndash; Full credit and rebill required</strong>.</span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="6.4" name="6.4"></a>6.4&nbsp;FAQ</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What is India GST?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>India Goods and Service Tax (GST) is a new tax regime in India which applies to Microsoft Advertising. This new tax regime replaces an existing service tax in India. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What&#39;s changing?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Customers in India (with their account business location in India) will receive three different tax line items on their invoice. Depending on their location, different tax rates will apply. Combined, all tax rates will be 18% vs. 15% which is applied prior to GST. Furthermore, customers will need to provide their GSTN and PAN numbers (local tax numbers). These numbers will be surfaced on the customers&rsquo; invoice. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What is the impact on my customer?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> We are asking all customers with ABL = India who have not provided their full account business location (ABL) address details, their PAN (required) and&nbsp;GSTIN (optional) number to provide this. This address is collected at the account level and can be updated from the <strong>All Accounts</strong>&nbsp;grid or the <strong>single account view</strong>. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Why is my customer seeing a lightbox?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The lightbox is triggered if a customer in India has not provided their PAN number or the full ABL address yet. <span><span><span><span><span>Non-SAP accounts are required to provide this information as it is vital for us to gather this data from customers.</span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Why are we doing this enforcement?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> We are doing this enforcement because we want to have the legally registered business address to help us identify, and understand the companies we are doing business with. This address is also used to determine if and how much tax should be applied to the customer. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: From whom do we need the address if my customer is an agency?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>The address information which we are collecting at account level is based on the <strong>Sold-to</strong>,&nbsp;this means we must collect the address of the end customer, not of the agency.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What about SAP customers?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong>For SAP customers, we leverage the Sold-to SAP information of the customer to determine the legally registered business address. All&nbsp;information is stored in SAP and must be manually updated by SAP. We should already have all&nbsp;information, but help collect the PAN &amp; GSTIN Number reactively and send it to GFS (also known as WOCS) per your standard operating procedure so that it can be added to SAP.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What happens if my customer does not provide this information now?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Your customer is running the risk to not be tax compliant which could mean your customer is unable to claim tax back from the government.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What if I have both a personal PAN and a business PAN &ndash; which should I use?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>The customer should always use the PAN their <strong>business</strong>. If the owner is a company and not an individual, then the company PAN should be used. It is important that the customer name and PAN match. If the customer shell is set up as an individual (with the individuals name) they should use the individual PAN. If it is a company, it should be the companies PAN. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I do not run my advertising campaigns in India. Am I still required to pay taxes?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes, Microsoft Advertising is mandated by the Indian Government to collect this tax, regardless of where your campaigns are running/targeted.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer provides a business location in <strong>one of the thirty-one</strong>&nbsp;countries and territories that Microsoft Advertising charges Value Added Tax (VAT), they will also be prompted to provide their VAT Registration Number in order to avoid the VAT tax (except in Ireland, Switzerland, and Lichtenstein where an exemption certificate is required to avoid VAT charges). When VAT ID/Exemption is applied, a 0% VAT will be applied to the customer&#39;s invoice and billing statements.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Some territories within VAT-eligible countries are automatically exempt. This exclusion will be automatic (even if the VAT field is displayed) based on the business address provided by the customer.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Microsoft VAT IDs</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
The VAT ID for Microsoft Ireland (MIOL) billing center is IE8256796U. If the customer&#39;s invoice VAT rate is 0% (for instance, they are exempt from VAT charges), this Ireland VAT Number will be displayed on the customer&#39;s invoices. If the customer VAT rate is &gt;0%, the local country MIOL VAT Number will be displayed (for example,&nbsp;DE192876773). These VAT IDs should not be entered on customer accounts because they are Microsoft&#39;s VAT IDs. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="9.7" name="9.7"></a>9.7 No VAT number: Claims of &#39;In Business&#39; from Sole Proprietor</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Sole Proprietors are businesses that are owned and run by one natural person in which there is no legal distinction between the person and the business. If one of these customers cannot provide a valid or invalid VAT number (with justification and alternative proof for the invalid number), they will be subject to receive VAT on their Microsoft Advertising costs. The VAT percentage will be based on the rate of their business location.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Impact of a postpay refund on an account with VAT.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>All adjustments over 10k must be processed by the regional SANOPS (aka AdOps) team. The below is intended for an understanding of the impact.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If a taxed payment is adjusted, taxes will be calculated into the refund, which will be slightly higher than the amount adjusted.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Postpay credit card example: 100 clicks each cost $1 = 100$ + VAT 20%=$120 charged on the card. A $10 goodwill adjustment from the statement tab would refund $10 + 20% = $12 back to the credit card.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In the above example, an invoice customer would receive a credit memo for $12.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Dual October invoices:</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer received an invoice from both Microsoft Online, Inc. (MOI) AND Microsoft Ireland Operations, Ltd (MIOL) for the October 2016 billing period, it is due to the billing transition resulting in the customer having minor spend for the first few hours/days before cutover. The customer is responsible for paying both invoices but <strong>will </strong>be able to pay both of these invoices with a single payment referencing their Microsoft Advertising account number and the associated invoices with a single payment to the MIOL bank remittance.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Two currencies on invoice:</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Invoices may reflect the balance amount in two currencies if the customer&#39;s billing currency in Microsoft Advertising differs from the VAT filing currency associated with the Sold-to country. As an example:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customer&#39;s billing (account) currency is set to EUR.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customer&#39;s Sold-To location is Switzerland and VAT filing currency is CHF for Sold-to Location of Switzerland.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Two columns will show on the customer&#39;s invoice.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Example: Totals row will show 1&#39;797.54 (CHF) ____1&#39;650.64 (EUR).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Remittance instructions will be based off the Bill-to information.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span><span>Agency questioning the lack of VAT on their client&#39;s invoice:</span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Check the account to see if there is an account business location listed. If there is no Sold-to SAP ID associated with the client account, the accounts business location will default to &lsquo;NULL&rsquo; in the database or blank in the UI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Check to see if a Sold-to SAP ID exists on the client&rsquo;s account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Look up under the Accounts tab in the UI.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Scroll down to the payment method section. Next to the &lsquo;Sold-to payment method&rsquo; see if there is a drop-down list available for you to select a SAP ID.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If there <strong>is&nbsp;</strong>a Sold-To ID available, direct the agency to select it, or select it on behalf of the agency.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>By doing this, it will define the ABL for the client account based on the Sold-to SAP address of the client. If the client is in a VAT market, they will also need to apply their VAT ID to the account. Assist them by following the process above for <strong>Invoice Customer Is Unable to Update their VAT ID or Business Location on their Own</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If&nbsp;there is&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;a Sold-to SAP ID, send a request to&nbsp;GFS (also known as WOCS) to add a Sold-to SAP ID for the client account to solve for this issue. Before escalating, confirm the client&rsquo;s business location. If they are in a VAT market, also send their VAT ID in the escalation to get it applied to their account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Once the Sold-to SAP ID is available, direct the agency to select it, or select it on behalf of the agency. By doing this, it will define the ABL for the client account based on the SAP address of the client (instead of it being NULL).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Agency customer wants to know why the Bill-to party is liable for the VAT if the advertiser information appears on the invoices:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Bill to party does <strong>not</strong> determine the VAT treatment in MIOL&rsquo;s invoices but rather the Sold-to party location and VAT status does. Customers should contact their tax advisers or local tax office for advice, if needed.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="9.8" name="9.8"></a>9.8 Agency wants their ABL and VAT to appear on their client invoices for taxes purposes</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span>Some agencies may request that their set up reflect the agency as the Bill To ABL and utilize the VAT (tax application) for their Sold-to client accounts&#39; invoices. To have this type of setup, advise the customer that individual advertiser details will <strong>not</strong> show on the invoices going forward. Instead, the agency details will show as both the Bill-to and the Sold-to party.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Starting March 2020 Microsoft started an effort to migrate SoldTo SAP IDs to Full ABLs. Invoice customers will see that any previously applied Sold To details will now default to their entered ABL details. This change applies to agency linked accounts, and allows Microsoft to identify who the end customer is (see FAQ in this section for more details).</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>FAQ</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: How should we treat customers with an agency hybrid shell?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span></span></strong><span><span><strong>A:</strong> If the agency is linked to an advertiser shell, and the advertiser is the bill-to and sold-to party, then the advertiser is the end customer and should therefore have to enter their ABL and VAT.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Q: What is a SoldTo SAP and how is it changing?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> Think of it as the payment method that is associated to an invoiced account. This payment method (just like a credit card) contains crucial customer information that is utilized to run checks against a customer&rsquo;s financial history for us to extend them with a credit line that they can use to accrue charges. A SoldTo SAP is specifically created and used to find out the end customer for which we are delivering ads. The party who ultimately is getting the return out of the advertising.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>In SoldTo deprecation, we will only perform checks against the BillTo SAP that is associated to an invoiced account. The SoldTo details are being replaced with Full Account Business Location, allowing us to store this information for taxation and sequential liability purposes. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Q: Why use Full Account Business Location?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> Full Account Business Location will start being enforced in the product. With this effort we will be collecting the same type of information that we have for SoldTo SAPs at the account level. This will allow us to get the information upfront and remove the dependency on SoldTo SAPs to know who the end customer for an account is.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The information available for Full ABL contains the same required for a SoldTo SAP. The plan is to utilize it to collect the required information that can be passed to WOCS for validation of who the end customer is for a managed invoiced account.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Q: Who is benefited by this change of using Full Account Business Location instead of SoldTo SAPs?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> Most importantly, the managed customers who are linked to another party responsible for billing. Customers will not have to wait for offline processes to complete to get their accounts eligible for delivery and spend. If they are linked to another party who becomes responsible for billing, they will spend against the credit limit already assigned for that party. <strong>Important</strong>: Our direct advertisers or accounts who are managed by another party that is <strong>not</strong> taking over billing will go through the same process of needing an SAP ID.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Q: What about existing accounts that are set up with a SoldTo SAP?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> For accounts in the system that currently have a SoldTo SAP that is different than the BillTo SAP we will start grabbing the corresponding information from the SAP and migrate it to Full ABL. We will migrate incrementally by market groups.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Q: What happens after SoldTo SAPs get deprecated and migrated to Full ABL?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> Upon being migrated, an invoiced account does not have a dependency to have a SoldTo SAP anymore. From that point onwards all workflows where the SoldTo SAP was being surfaced will now surface the Full ABL.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>All workflows or rules that relied on SoldTo SAP should start only utilizing Full ABL. Allowing the end customer to enter the information inline, which will be immediately sent for WOCS Risk review in the form of a system triggered UCM-T ticket.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>AMs and support advocates do not need to do this on behalf of the customer through an offline ticket. The customer can perform the action or if hand holding is needed this can be done by internal users in the product. Full ABL will be required for invoiced accounts when taking over billing, agency linking with billing takeover and payment option switching to invoice. We are now enforcing Full ABL everywhere. No more accounts without it.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Q: What is the process if any follow up is required?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> An account will be placed on manual hold while the clarifying information is provided. If customer outreach is required, WOCS will reach out to CSS (or AM for managed advertisers) to request customer outreach for necessary information. </span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: What does this mean to your customers? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>A:</strong> All customers who are managed by agencies (with linked accounts) where the agency is responsible for billing will be required to provide a Full Account Business Location.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>The business location should be that of the end customer as called out in the help pop up in the product.</span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span>Business location</span></span></span>

		<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li><span><span><span>What it is: This is the country/region where your business is legally registered. (If you are an agency, this is the country/region where your client is legally registered.)</span></span></span></li>
			<li><span><span><span>Why is it important: Business location determines your tax accounting obligations.</span></span></span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong> </strong></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: There will be accounts that will transition from MOI to MIOL (Microsoft Ireland Operations Limited) based on the country submitted in the business location. We had instances where a lot of customers had NULL SoldTo information and now is our opportunity to get their real location.</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>A:</strong> We look at the <strong>Account Business Location (ABL)</strong> on file for each individual account. If the country is in an in-tax scope market, the account will be taxed unless a TAX VAT ID/Certificate is provided.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>If the ABL=blank on the account, the customers will be forced through several workflows to provide this information. In this scenario accounts whose country falls into MIOL will transition to that company code.</span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span>When this is the case two billing documents will be generated. All remittance instructions and the reason for the change are being exposed in the invoices for customers to understand how to proceed moving forward.</span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span>The customer may be prompted to enter their TAX VAT ID, if it is not already on the account. In such cases, the ensuing billing cycle will generate only one billing document for the month, regardless of when the TAX VAT ID was added to the account.&nbsp; It will reflect the TAX/VAT amount and apply it for the entirety of the month.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: How will this impact my customers account activity? Is there a chance they will go dark? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> Accounts will continue to deliver during this transition. There is no expected downtime. </span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: Will this introduce any new tax treatment for our customers? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>A:</span></strong><span> Yes, this change introduces taxing if the Full Business Location country falls under a taxable country/company code. </span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: How does the deprecation impact monthly invoice customers? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong>A: </strong>Monthly invoice customers who transition to Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd., will need to update their payment remittance instructions for all invoices issued by MIOL. This is explained in the billing documents. Impacted accounts have been transitioning since Mid-April, as this is mainly for EMEA. The United States and France are scheduled to transition in July. The customer may receive two invoices for the month when their SoldTo SAP ID is deprecated and if they move to MIOL. </span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: Why will my customer possibly see two invoices for the month they transition to MIOL? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong>A:</strong> Depending on the exact date and time the account SoldTo SAP ID deprecates, the system will generate two invoices. One invoice will reflect ad delivery and revenue associated with Microsoft Online Inc., and the other invoice will be from the transition date onward reflecting ad delivery and revenue associated with Microsoft Ireland Operations Ltd.</span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: Can my customer pay for two invoices with one single payment? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We are aware that some customers may only be able to issue a single payment to a vendor for a billing period. Our accounts receivable team can accept and acknowledge payment for two invoices with one payment if the following requirements are provided with the payment: </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Customer name </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Billing document numbers </span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Q: Where will my customer find more information about the changes to monthly invoice remittance changes? </span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Customers will be notified within their monthly invoice documents issued starting in March. The Microsoft Advertising Help files will also be updated to include this information. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span> Some larger advertisers may require Microsoft be established within their accounting systems as an established vendor/supplier to remit payment for services rendered. These requests usually referenced as &lsquo;Vendor&rsquo; or &lsquo;Supplier&rsquo; forms. Microsoft Advertising customers should use these forms to establish Microsoft in their Accounts Payable systems to remit payment to Microsoft for charges due.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Provide the advertiser the pre-signed Microsoft as a vendor/supplier form as well (as the W-9 for US-based customers):</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>In cases where the advertiser submits their own third-party form for completion by Microsoft, refer the customer to the pre-signed form listed below.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>In cases where there are language challenges for the advertiser, advocates may assist the advertiser in completing the form.</span></span></span></span></li>
