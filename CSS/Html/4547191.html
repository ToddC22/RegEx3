<h3 class="kb-symptoms-section section"><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Dunning overview</h3>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>If Microsoft tries to process but can&rsquo;t collect a recurring subscription charge, the subscription enters a collections process called dunning. Microsoft will periodically try to collect the past due balance when a subscription is in dunning. Customers can also pay manually using Pay Now flows on </span></span></span><span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services" target="_blank"><span><span><span>https://account.microsoft.com/services</span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span> or Xbox consoles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Renewal charges fail for a variety of reasons, including:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Expired payment instrument</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Low CSV account balance</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Insufficient funds</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Closed account</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Risk rejection from the card provider or from Microsoft</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>From a customer&#39;s perspective, the dunning process maintains uninterrupted subscription benefits when a temporarily issue prevents a charge from completing successfully. If the problem persists, dunning will pause subscription benefits until the balance is paid. If a customer&rsquo;s payment instrument is expired or not working, they may also have trouble completing other purchases. However, dunning itself does not prevent other purchases.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>If a customer contacts us for help with a subscription in dunning, you can help cancel the subscription or pay the balance using Pay Now in MST. A new payment method is usually required to complete the charge using Pay Now.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Dunning has two primary phases.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span><span>Phase 1: Dunning grace</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> starts when the subscription renewal charge doesn&rsquo;t complete and can last from days to a couple of weeks.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>During dunning grace, the customer <em><span>should</span></em> be able to use subscription benefits (such as games and online multiplayer) because they remain entitled in our system.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>Dunning grace is not a trial period.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span><span>Phase 2: Dunning locked/suspended</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> starts when the grace period ends, and entitlements are locked.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>During dunning locked, the customer can&rsquo;t use their subscription because entitlements are expired in our system.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>If the past due balance isn&rsquo;t paid by the end of phase 2, the subscription will eventually expire and cancel. The past due amount will be written off with no collections or credit reporting implications for the customer. After a subscription cancels, a new one can be created.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Supporting a customer in dunning - do&rsquo;s and don&rsquo;ts</h3>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>When supporting customers in dunning (grace or locked), remember these simple rules:</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span>Do</span></span></h3>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Help the customer cancel their subscription or pay the balance using Pay Now.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h3><span><span>Don&rsquo;t</span></span></h3>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span><span><span>Suggest a refund</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Don&#39;t offer or suggest a refund.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span><span><span>Issue a code</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Do not generate or give CSV to help a customer pay the balance. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Do not generate a subscription token to help a customer token out of dunning.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span><span><span>Suggest creating another account</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Don&#39;t suggest customers open another account.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Don&#39;t tell customers ways to use their home console to share and use a friend&#39;s subscription.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span><span><span>Give the customer dates/timelines of the dunning cycle</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Don&rsquo;t tell customers specific details on the dunning cycle (how many days grace, locked, how long before their account clears). Our system can vary, and dunning timing is not something that we share with the public.</span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>If a customer doesn&rsquo;t want to pay and intends to let the subscription lapse, and then asks how long that takes you may say &ldquo;<em><span>in a few months your subscription will cancel itself and the balance will clear, this can take two to three months. Your credit won&rsquo;t be impacted and you aren&rsquo;t sent to collections or penalized for this</span></em>&rdquo;,<strong> </strong>so they know there is no financial or credit risk to lapsing if they choose.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><a id="4" name="4"></a>4.&nbsp;<span><span><span>Token out of d<span>unning</span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></h3>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Token out of dunning is not advertised to customers and should not usually be promoted. However, customers can cure subscriptions from dunning by redeeming prepaid subscription codes. Token out of dunning enables customers to redeem tokens in this scenario. The result is essentially the same as paying a past due balance with Pay Now.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>When a subscription is tokened out of dunning, it is technically canceled, and a new subscription is created based on the prepaid code&rsquo;s time minus the grace time already used. Overall, the customer will not lose any time through this process so it&rsquo;s a great self-serve option.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span><span><span>Notes:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The token must be for the same product as the subscription in dunning.</span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>An exception is Game Pass Ultimate in dunning grace. Any Gold or Game Pass token should be redeemable provided the converted time will cover grace time already used.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>A token may be a useful recommendation in limited cases where customers are unable to Pay Now with an advocate. For example, if a customer does not have a payment method that can be added or used to Pay Now (for example, some CSV scenarios), a token from a retailer can get the customer back to gaming.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Customers can&rsquo;t downgrade or otherwise change the subscription product (such as, Ultimate to Gold) through token out of dunning. They must cancel the subscription using available options, and then purchase the desired subscription.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Customers who say they already have a token may be able to token out of dunning. This means they may be able to apply a prepaid subscription code to the account and the dunning balance will be removed as part of a conversion.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>This is not advertised and should not be offered to the customer as a solution to get out of dunning. But if a customer already has a prepaid code that you think may work, you can help them try. Never promise they can token out of dunning.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>If the customer has a smaller token (for example, a one-month Gold token is less expensive than a three-month Game Pass Ultimate) there will be a conversion, and the customer will get the amount applied to the current subscription. Once the conversion is complete and the past due balance is resolved, they can then cancel and change subscription type.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>Customers can&rsquo;t downgrade using token out of dunning (for example, they cannot downgrade from Ultimate to Gold using a token) at this time. To do that they should pay the balance, or you can process a cancellation on the subscription in dunning.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><span><span>If a customer is attempting to token out of dunning and it is not working, a cancellation can be processed. </span></span></span></span></p>
