<p><span><span><span><span>Review account activity to determine if the customer is possibly engaging in fraud.<br>
<br>
To improve Microsoft&rsquo;s ability to identify and hold fraudulent parties accountable:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Clearly communicate when a customer&rsquo;s request is denied.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Document within the service request when a customer&#39; request is denied and summarize the reasons why it was denied.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Determine if there is a history of policy abuse by reviewing previous service requests and escalate if the customer has already received a denial message for the same or similar requests.</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>If there are no previous service requests on the account, search for the customer by using their phone number to see if there are related accounts. Report if you find multiple accounts associated with the same phone number showing similar behavior.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>Do not report if:</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The account does not show a history of refund/credit, promotion, subscription, or hardware replacement abuse:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>There are no previous SRs on the account in question and no secondary accounts are located when searching with the customer&rsquo;s phone number (for example, no history of possible fraud or abuse linked with the account).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>A denial message has not been previously delivered and documented by another support advocate.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
