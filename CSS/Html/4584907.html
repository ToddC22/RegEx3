<h3><span><span><span><span><span>What is this article about?</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>This article steps the user through how to create, persist and pin a custom view and creating a Pin to support custom view in the CRM tool. </span></span></span></span></span></p>
<h3><a id="Procedure" name="Procedure"></a></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>In some instances, it might be important to create, persist and pin a custom view. While the filter function of the various system view is convenient for quick, narrow searches, it does not persist. This will be a general guide for how to create, persist and pin a custom view. It will work on most pages where there is a funnel in the black bar. We will be using the Collaboration-&gt;Case Assignment-&gt;Assignments as the sample.<br>
<span asset="4584908" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4584908]</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Navigate to the Collaboration-&gt;Case Assignment-&gt;Assignments view. </span></span></span></span></span></span><br>
	<span><span><span><span><span>The default view is Active Bookable Resource Bookings. This view shows you all of the resources in CRM that have had cases booked for the last few months.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Click on the funnel noted above. This will open up a new advanced find page.<br>
	<span asset="4584909" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4584909]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Items of interest are Results, Save As, Edit Columns, Details, Saved Views and the Grouping options.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>First think needing to be done is make this view editable. Click on Details.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>This will change the bottom of the view to something similar to this.<br>
	<span asset="4584910" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4584910]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can now edit the view. If you want to add date ranges, click on the Select and you will be presented with a drop-down. The first part, Fields, are the fields available. You can only display these fields. Further down the list is Related. These are the other views that can be joined to this view.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select Start Time. You will be presented with a drop-down of options. I have one built using today only.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>While this is a good start, the filter is still too wide. You will want to filter to your team/region.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Click on the </span></span><span><span><span>Select</span></span></span><span><span>. This time scroll down to <strong>Related</strong> until you locate <strong>Resource</strong>. This will add the Resource view.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Click on the </span></span><span><span><span>Select</span></span></span><span><span>, again. This time scroll down to until you locate <strong>Site</strong> in <strong>Fields</strong>. This will add the site field to filter on. The easy way to determine you site is to open your resource record and locate the <strong>Site</strong> field under organization details. Add a filter of *<em>Equals</em> and enter your site name. This value is validated. This will limit the view results to just your team.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Click on the <strong>Results</strong> </span></span><span><span><span>!</span></span></span><span><span> to confirm the accuracy of your filter.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Once confirmed, click on the <strong>Advanced Find</strong> and return to the filter builder.<br>
	<span asset="4584911" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4584911]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Click on the </span></span><span><span><span>Select</span></span></span><span><span>, again. This time the filter will be for <strong>Country</strong> the </span></span><span><span><span>Equals</span></span></span><span><span> your country.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Click on Save As and give your filtered view a name.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Note, if you want to share this view after you have saved it, click on the <strong>Saved Views</strong>. Put a check mark by the view you just created. Then click on the <strong>Share</strong> in the menu bar You will be prompted for the name of the team or person you want to share this with.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Here is a screenshot of a view used for the AKS team.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br>
	<span><span><span><span><span><span><span asset="4584912" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4584912]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>To use the Or/And grouping, click on the down arrow just to the right of the field and choose select row. Once multiple rows are selected you can group them accordingly. You can also delete rows using the down arrow.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Click on the push pin just to the left of the view title. This will pin the view so the next time you go to Collaboration-&gt;Case Assignment-&gt;Assignments you will see this view.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br>
	<span><span><span><span><span>This completes the creation of your first filtered view. Explore other pages where you can do this to streamline your workflow.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
