<p><span><a id="4" name="4"></a>There are different types of offers that can be published to Marketplace. The following do not have any publishing fees:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Listing &ndash; a basic listing with &#39;contact me&#39;&nbsp;for lead generation</span></li>
	<li><span>Trial &ndash; offers a free trial to demonstrate solution&rsquo;s capabilities and help convert customers faster</span></li>
	<li><span>Bring your own licence (BYOL) &ndash; for customers to quickly deploy an offer</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span>If a solution is purchased via Commercial Marketplace (Transact), then revenues for software licence are split between the publisher and Microsoft. T</span><span><span>his is done in accordance with&nbsp;the terms and conditions in the </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://cloudpartner.azure.com/Content/Unversioned/PublisherAgreement2.pdf" managed-link="" target="_blank">Marketplace Publisher Agreement</a><span><span>.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The below table also provides information on which offer types can currently be published to which storefront.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Publisher pricing options and fees for transact offers</strong></p>

<p><span><span>Microsoft enables the sale of third-party software, and deployment of some offer types to the customer&#39;s Azure subscription. The publisher must consider the billing of infrastructure fees, and the publisher&#39;s own software licensing fees, when selecting a billing model and offer type. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The transact publishing option is currently supported for the following offer types: Virtual Machines, Azure Applications, and SaaS Apps.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span asset="4541243" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4541243]</span></p>

<p><strong>Publisher payout</strong></p>

<p>The standard rate for publishing is a 20% fee for transactions conducted via Azure Marketplace or AppSource, Microsoft field-assisted (Eg Co-sell), and Cloud Solution Provider (CSP). As an example: If a product was listed at $100.00 (USD), when sold Microsoft would pay $80.00 to the publisher and retain $20.00. IP Co-Sell eligible SaaS applications qualify for 10% off the standard publishing fee; the effective fee for transactions is then 10%. Using the same example above, Microsoft would pay $90.00 to the publisher and retain $10.00 for the SaaS application.</p>
