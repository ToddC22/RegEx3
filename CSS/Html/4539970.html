<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This TSG explains Azure services and charges.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This TSG applies to SEs and TAs who are monitoring the following queues:</p>

<p><strong>Overage Notification Received While Monetary Commitment is Available</strong></p>

<p>This may occur if the Enrollment has usage of services charged separately from Azure Pre-payment. These are listed in the usage reports in the EA portal under <strong>Charges Billed Separately</strong>.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>Billing of Charges Billed Separately and Azure Marketplace services</strong></p>

<p>Services consumed under Charges Billed Separately and Azure Marketplace are published by third-party publishers. <span><span>Azure Pre-payment can be used for </span></span><a href="https://admin.ea.azure.com/enrollmentHelp?enrollmentId=100951"><span>a subset of these charges</span></a><span>.</span> Services consumed under Charges Billed Separately or Azure Marketplace are invoiced on the same cycle as Azure Service Overage invoices.</p>

<h4><a id="Changing Purchase Order Numbers" name="Changing Purchase Order Numbers"></a>Changing Purchase Order Numbers</h4>

<p>The EA Portal automatically generates a default <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4536699">Purchase Order Number</a> unless the customer sets one in advance of the invoicing date. The customer can update a Purchase Order Number in the EA Portal by doing the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span>Log in as an EA Administrator.</span></li>
	<li><span>Navigate to the <strong>Reports &gt; Usage Summary</strong> page.</span></li>
	<li><span>Click <strong>View/Edit PO#</strong>. This opens a panel in which you can edit the PO Number. </span></li>
</ol>

<p>An EA Administrator can update the Purchase Order at any time before the invoice is generated for the current Billing Quarter, and <em>up to 7 days after receiving the automated invoice notification email.</em> If that deadline has passed, the EA Admin should complete a credit and rebill. The SE can submit a request for the Billings team to do this using the customer&rsquo;s desired PO number.</p>

<h4><a id="Checking Azure Services pricing" name="Checking Azure Services pricing"></a>Checking Azure Services pricing</h4>

<p>Direct Customers can check their price sheet for Azure Services in the EA Portal by doing the following:</p>

	<li><span> Click <strong>Price Sheet</strong>.</span></li>
	<li><span> Click <strong>Download</strong>.</span></li>
</ol>

<p>Indirect customers should reach out to their Channel Partners to get their price sheet and pricing details.</p>

<h4><a id="Reconciling Azure Usage to SKUs" name="Reconciling Azure Usage to SKUs"></a>Reconciling Azure Usage to SKUs</h4>

<p>The customer can reconcile Azure Usage to their purchased SKUs and validate it against their Overage invoice by downloading their Usage Summary and price sheet in CSV format from the EA portal.</p>

<h4><a id="Updating Billing Contact Information" name="Updating Billing Contact Information"></a>Updating Billing Contact Information</h4>

<p>The Customer should reach out to their Partner or Software Advisor to update the Bill-to Contact at the agreement level.</p>

<p>Partners and Software Advisors should submit a Customer Information Change Request (CICR) form to the ROC to update the Bill-to Contact. <span>This can also be done through </span><a href="https://eagreements.microsoft.com/AgreementWeb/Login.aspx"><span>eAgreements</span></a> <span><span> </span></span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span>, which only Partners and Software Advisors have access to.</span></p>

<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<h4>Billing for Expired or Terminated Enrollments</h4>

<p>We <strong>can</strong> bill expired Enrollments for overage that happened before the expiration date, but <strong>cannot</strong> bill for overage that happened after the expiration date.</p>

<p>We <strong>cannot</strong> bill an Enrollment whose status is terminated, unless the ROC can confirm that the termination letter requires the end customer to pay Azure Overage charges.</p>

<h3><a id="Customer Experience and Provisioning" name="Customer Experience and Provisioning"></a>Customer Experience and Provisioning</h3>

<h4><a id="Purchasing Azure Services" name="Purchasing Azure Services"></a>Purchasing Azure Services</h4>

<p><span><span>Customers can purchase Microsoft Azure Services in one or more of the following ways.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Azure Pre-payment</strong>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Fully Prepaid Option: The customer chooses to be invoiced for the full amount up front. They have access to the entire Pre-payment throughout the term of its Enrollment. Any unused Pre-payment will be forfeited at the end of the Enrollment.</li>
		<li>Annually Prepaid Option: The customer chooses to be invoiced for Pre-payment on an annual basis. They have access to an Allocated Annual Commitment each year of the Enrollment, and any unused Allocated Annual Commitment will be forfeited on the following Enrollment anniversary date. The customer may contact Microsoft or the reseller about increasing its Pre-payment or reducing the Allocated Annual Commitment for any future Enrollment anniversary. Resellers must process reductions with Microsoft before the next anniversary.  </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Consumption<span>:</span></strong><span> The customer pays based on the amount of Microsoft Azure Services consumed during a billing period. Certain features of the Microsoft Azure Services may only be available for purchase on a consumption basis.</span></li>
	<li><strong>Microsoft Azure Services Plan<span>:</span></strong><span> The customer may be able to subscribe to a Microsoft Azure Service as a Microsoft Azure Services Plan.</span> Aside from Azure Stack, Services purchased as a Microsoft Azure Services Plan are not eligible for the Hosting Exception in the Online Services Terms.</li>
	<li><strong>Automatic Provisioning<span>:</span></strong><span> As part of the Server and Cloud Enrollment, customers who have not ordered Microsoft Azure Services as part of their Enrollment may receive an activation email from Microsoft inviting them to provision Microsoft Azure Services under their Enrollment without Pre-payment.</span></li>
	<li><strong>Azure Reservations<span>: </span></strong><span>Azure Reservations are advance purchases of eligible Azure services. They are purchased for specified terms of one or three years using either a single up-front payment or a monthly payment plan. They expire at the end of the specified term. The customer is not refunded payment for unused Azure Reservations. Unless the customer&rsquo;s volume licensing agreement says otherwise, <span>fixed pricing does not apply to Azure Reservations. </span></span><span> </span><span> </span><span>Azure Reservation pricing will be based on the available pricing at the time of each purchase.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="Payment and Fees" name="Payment and Fees"></a>Payment and Fees</h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Using Pre-payment:</strong> Each month, Microsoft deducts the monetary value of Customer&rsquo;s usage of eligible Microsoft Azure Services from the customer&rsquo;s Pre-payment or Allocated Annual Commitment. Once the customer&rsquo;s Pre-payment or Allocated Annual Commitment balance has been exhausted, any additional usage will be invoiced as overage.</li>
	<li><strong>Invoicing Pre-payment:</strong> If the customer chooses the Fully Prepaid Option, Pre-payment will be invoiced immediately. If the customer chooses the Annually Prepaid Option, the first Allocated Annual Commitment will be invoiced immediately, and future Allocated Annual Commitments will be invoiced on the anniversary of the Enrollment effective date.</li>
	<li><strong>Invoicing Pre-payment Overage</strong>: If the customer&rsquo;s usage is higher than either their Pre-payment under the Fully Prepaid Option or their Allocated Annual Commitment under the Annually Prepaid Option, <span><span><span>that excess will be invoiced as overage to the customer or the reseller in the month following the end of the current billing period.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><strong>Consumption (Overage) Invoicing</strong>: If the customer provisions Microsoft Azure Services without Pre-payment, they or the reseller will be invoiced monthly as overage. All usage of the Microsoft Azure Services after the expiration or termination of the customer&rsquo;s subscription term will be invoiced to the customer or reseller at then-current Consumption Rates on a monthly basis.</li>
	<li><strong>Azure Services Plan Invoice</strong>: The purchase of a Microsoft Azure Services Plan will be invoiced to the customer or reseller according to the terms of the customer&rsquo;s volume licensing agreement governing payment terms for the order of Online Services generally.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Pre-payment cannot be applied to the purchase of a Microsoft Azure Plan, but if a Microsoft Azure Services Plan includes the purchase of an initial quantity of a service (&ldquo;Initial Quantity&rdquo;), usage that exceeds the Initial Quantity will be billed as overage, and Pre-payment can be applied to that overage.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Azure Reservations</strong>: The purchase of Azure Reservations will be deducted automatically from any available Pre-payment. If the customer has used all of their Pre-payment or if the cost of Azure Reservations exceeds the available Pre-payment balance at the time of purchase, the excess will be invoiced as overage.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Azure Reserved Instances for a virtual machine or for Azure SQL Database services cover compute only (the base rate) and do not include the cost of the software (for example, Windows Server or SQL Server), storage or back-up.</li>
		<li>Azure Reserved Instances for software do not include the cost of compute.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Pre-payment vs. Overage: </strong>Pre-payment is not required in Enterprise Agreements. Customers can choose to start with a small Pre-payment and pay monthly, or start with no Pre-payment and consume as overage<span>. </span><span> </span><span> </span>The pricing stays the same regardless of how they choose to pay Microsoft.</li>

<h4><a id="Billing Schedule" name="Billing Schedule"></a>Billing Schedule</h4>

<p><span><span>The system usually starts a job to calculate the charges for a given month on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of the following month. The system batch job will take some time to run, but charges for a given month are usually finalized by the 5<sup>th</sup> of the following month. Invoice summary notifications are usually generated on the 5<sup>th</sup> or 6<sup>th</sup> of the following month. The date the notification was sent can be seen in the EA Portal on the <em>View Invoice List &ndash; Modern View</em>.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Note: </span></span></strong><span><span>The<strong> </strong>EA Portal uses UTC time.   </span></span></p>

<p><span asset="4539976" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4539976]</span></p>

<p><span><span>After the notification is sent, the customer (for direct customers) or partner (for indirect customers) has 7 days to update the PO number or dispute charges, after which the invoice will be visible in </span></span><a href="http://www.explore.ms/"><span><span>Explore.ms</span></span></a><span><span>. Most invoices are created between the 11<sup>th</sup> and the 15<sup>th</sup> of the month. Invoices which require review or manual adjustment will be released slightly later in the month, after the review is completed. </span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><a id="Receiving Azure Service Overage Invoices" name="Receiving Azure Service Overage Invoices"></a>Receiving Azure Service Overage Invoices</span></span></h4>

<p><strong>Direct Customers: </strong></p>

<p>Direct Enterprise Azure (EA) customers are set up on an annual, quarterly or monthly billing cycle whose timing depends on when the enrollment is created.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>For Annual billing, the billing cycle is based on the Enrollment anniversary date, the date the agreement took effect. A customer will receive their first Azure Service Overage invoice when the total of their commitment usage and service overage exceeds <em>150%</em> of their Pre-payment threshold.</span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>The customer&rsquo;s Pre-payment includes their initial monetary commitment, new purchases, and any monetary commitment adjustments made to date.</span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>Once usage exceeds 150% of the Pre-payment threshold, the customer will be converted automatically to a Quarterly Billing cycle based on the Anniversary date. If the customer does not surpass 150% of their Pre-payment threshold, the Enrollment will stay on an Annual Billing cycle and receive the Overage invoice at the end of the Commitment year. </span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Example scenario: </strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span>If the Anniversary date is February 1, the Quarters will be:</span>

	<ul>
		<li><span>February &ndash; April </span></li>
		<li><span>May &ndash; July </span></li>
		<li><span>August &ndash; October </span></li>
		<li><span>November &ndash; January </span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span>If the Anniversary Pre-payment for the Commitment Year is $30K, the customer added New Purchases of $15K in March, and there was a monetary commitment adjustment of $5K provided in April: </span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span>To receive an Azure Service Overage invoice and convert to a Quarterly Billing cycle, usage would need to surpass 50K*150%=<strong>75K</strong>. </span></li>
		<li><span>If, by mid-June, consumption is at $76K, then the customer has passed the 150% threshold. The Overage invoice will be released at the end of the Billing Quarter, and the customer&rsquo;s billing cycle will be quarterly for the rest of the Commitment year. In this scenario, the first overage invoice will be released in mid-August, after the end of the May-July quarter. </span></li>
		<li><span>If consumption stays below $75K, the agreement remains on an Annual Billing cycle, and the customer will receive any Overage invoices at the end of the Commitment year. </span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Direct enrollments created between 1 Dec 2017 and 30 April 2018 are on a Quarterly billing cycle, while those created on or after 1 May 2018 are on a monthly billing cycle. The customer will receive the invoice around mid-month after the quarter or month has closed.</p>

<p><strong>Indirect Customers: </strong></p>

<p>Indirect EA customers are set up on a Quarterly Billing cycle (enrollments created before 1 May 2018) or a Monthly Billing Cycle (enrollments created on or after 1 May 2018). The Channel Partner (CP) will directly invoice the customer.</p>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<h4><a id="Request for Invoice Copies" name="Request for Invoice Copies"></a>Request for Invoice Copies</h4>

<p>This scenario applies when a customer requests copies of their invoice.</p>

<p><span><span>Invoice copies are sent to the Bill-to Contact set up under the agreement. This information is available on </span></span><a href="http://www.explore.ms" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Explore.ms</span></span></span></a><span><span>.

<p><strong>Validating Requests</strong></p>

<p>You may provide invoice copies to people in the following roles:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Microsoft internal users</li>
	<li>Enterprise Administrators, Software Advisors, or Billing Contacts of direct Enrollments</li>
	<li>Resellers or Billing Contacts of indirect enrollments.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the requester is not in any of these roles, ask them to get in touch with a person in one of these roles about the request.</p>

<h4><a id="Misalignment Between Azure Service Overage invoice and EA Portal Usage Report" name="Misalignment Between Azure Service Overage invoice and EA Portal Usage Report"></a>Misalignment Between Azure Service Overage invoice and EA Portal Usage Report</h4>

<p>Direct the customer to make sure their invoice is reviewed against EA Portal usage data after the end of the billing cycle. Each billing month closes on the 5<sup>th</sup> of the following month. This is reflected in the EA Portal UI as well as all featured Usage Summaries and detailed reports.</p>

<h4><a id="Requesting Final Pay-As-You-Go Invoice Balance" name="Requesting Final Pay-As-You-Go Invoice Balance"></a>Requesting Final Pay-As-You-Go Invoice Balance</h4>

<p>Customers who have migrated from a Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) agreement to an EA Enrollment may request a copy of the final PAYG invoice balance, as well as details of how the customer&rsquo;s Pre-payment has been applied to that balance.</p>

<p><span>Assist the customer in downloading their invoice using </span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646733#Customer%20Unable%20to%20Download%20Invoice">TSG 2646733</a> (How to Download Billing and Usage Files).<span> </span><span> </span></p>

<h4><span><a id="Overage Invoice Received after End of Agreement" name="Overage Invoice Received after End of Agreement"></a>Overage Invoice Received after End of </span>Agreement</h4>

<p>After the end of an Agreement, the Enrollment enters an indefinite Extended Term. This allows services to continue while a new payment instrument is determined or the enrollment is renewed. Any usage during Extended Term will be invoiced monthly&nbsp;as an Azure Service Overage.</p>

<h4><a id="India Credit and Rebill Due to Wrong Ship-To" name="India Credit and Rebill Due to Wrong Ship-To"></a>India Credit and Rebill Due to Wrong Ship-To</h4>

<p>This scenario applies when a customer wants to credit and rebill an India invoice due to an incorrect ship-to address.</p>

<p><strong>SE Directions</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span> <span><span>When the Partner opens a case with ASMS, direct the Partner to return their invoice to the warehouse.</span></span><br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> In some cases, you will find the invoice number in the file with &quot;Hold&quot; in the comments. This is because the Partner receives a soft copy of the invoice before the warehouse sends the hard copy. If the Partner realizes that the ship-to address on the invoice is wrong before the hard copy is sent, they may ask the warehouse not to send it. In that case, the warehouse will update the file with the invoice number and add a &ldquo;Hold&rdquo; comment. Since the invoice was never sent to the Partner, the Partner does not need to send it back to the warehouse and you can proceed with step 5 in the process. </span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Direct the Partner to provide the warehouse&rsquo;s confirmation that the invoice is returned. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Open a </span></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4094770"><span><span>non-credit issue TFS</span></span></a><span><span> to Billing to request a cosmetic rebill. Include the invoice return confirmation.<br>
	Once the rebill is generated, the India partner has 7 days to update the ship-to address. This is self-serviceable through the partner portal. After 7 days, the rebill will be released from SAP hold and generated with the corrected ship-to address. For more information on India processes, </span></span>see <span><a bookmark-id="India Invoice Hold" href="#India Invoice Hold" managed-link="">India Invoice Hold</a> </span><span> </span><span> </span>below.</span></li>
	<li><span><span>After the invoice with the corrected ship-to address is sent back to SAP, you can verify in </span><a href="http://www.explore.ms/"><span>Explore.ms</span></a><span> that the new invoice has been generated. You can then close the case. </span></span></li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>India Invoice Hold </strong></p>

<p>All Azure overage invoices for India go on hold, and the Partner is asked to confirm the ship-to address within seven calendar days. Once the ship-to address is confirmed, the invoice is automatically sent within a few hours.</p>

<p>If the partner takes no action within seven calendar days, the invoice will be sent to the most recently used ship-to address for that end customer. If there is no previous ship-to address, the ROC will contact the Partner up to three times to confirm the ship-to address. If the partner does not reply after three attempts, the order will stay on hold. </p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: If an invoice is released in the last week of the month, and the 7 day period extends into the next month, follow <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4463565">the ROC escalation </a> process to expedite the hold process.</p>

<p>Tax information is not available in the EA portal. It is configured in SAP. All questions about Tax or VAT should be addressed by the Regional Operations Center (ROC).</p>

<p>If the request comes from a customer, direct them to contact their Partner or Software Advisor to submit a Call Logging Tool (CLT) ticket to the ROC. If the SR comes from a partner or Software Advisor, use the <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4463565">Warm Transfer Process</a> and create a ticket to the ROC on their behalf. </p>
