When they select the link to validate the product, the customer enters a Microsoft account.

<ol start="4">
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Shop</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>:&nbsp;Your purchase processed and completed in the Microsoft Store.

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong><span><strong><span><span><span>Will customers receive Biz-Bar notifications to check eligibility to renew or buy their subscription?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>From May 11</span></span></span><sup><span><span><span>th</span></span></span></sup><span><span><span> through 28</span></span></span><sup><span><span><span>th</span></span></span></sup><span><span><span>, 2020, HUP is running an experiment on the in-app Microsoft 365 Biz-Bar. Normally this is to inform the user that it&rsquo;s time to renew their subscription. The experiment will send a small percent of customers who are eligible for renewal or in grace period (dunning) two Biz Bar messages: </span></span></span><em><span><span>&ldquo;USE OFFICE AT WORK?&rdquo; and Your employer may be eligible to offer you a 30% discount on Microsoft 365 subscription for your personal use.</span></span></em><span><span><span> The customer can select the <strong><span>Check Eligibility</span></strong> button. This doesn&rsquo;t mean they are eligible, as the Biz Bar messages don&rsquo;t have a target audience (except for customers eligible for renewal).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>After selecting the <strong>Eligibility</strong> button, the customer will go to the Home Use Program sign up page. The customer should enter their <strong>work</strong> email credentials to check eligibility. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If eligible, they will get an email with a link to sign up with a personal Microsoft account (not their work email) and purchase Microsoft 365 at a discount. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If not eligible, they will receive an email that they are not eligible to buy, and the email should direct the customer to make a purchase online at regular price. Using the consumer SKU Chooser Page.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong>The employee has likely double-clicked the&nbsp;<strong>Get started</strong>&nbsp;button.

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I never received an email after entering in my work or corporate email address on the HUP Program page, should I expect one?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Standard troubleshooting includes asking the employee to check their junk or spam mail. Ensure they are not blocking any emails from </span></span></span><span><span><span><span><a href="mailto:account@microsoft.com" target="_blank"><span><span>account@microsoft.com</span></span></a></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>. If they still have not received an email 24 hours after entering their work email address, refer them to their benefits or IT admin for their employer for further support. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I received an error when signing in after selecting Login to my Personal Account on my eligibility email. What should I do?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Most sign in problems appear when customers are trying to login using their work or corporate email address again, instead of using a personal Microsoft account email. Confirm they are signing in using a personal email address.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can I take advantage of the HUP offer if I already have Microsoft 365 Family or Microsoft 365 Personal installed on my personal device? (Office only)</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Yes. If you already have Microsoft 365 Family or Microsoft 365 Personal, you can still take advantage of this discount and apply it to your current Microsoft 365 subscription. Once purchased, an additional year stacks to your existing subscription, and the discounted rate will begin at your existing subscription&rsquo;s annual renewal date. Be sure to specify the Microsoft account that&rsquo;s associated with your current Microsoft 365 subscription.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q:&nbsp;</span></span></span>Why am I seeing Office at 30% off pricing on the HUP page, but it changes to full price during checkout or in the cart?</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If an employee has not completed all steps for eligibility (see the employee walkthrough above), and are on the Office assortment page, they will see discounted pricing. This is because the messaging on this page is static and does not change whether you are eligible or not. Once they select <strong>Buy Now</strong> and go to the store cart, it will revert to full price. The HUP Office assortment page has static messaging built on the page. It will appear as $69.99 or $49.99 (30% off) to all visitors regardless if you are eligible for HUP or not.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To solve this scenario, guide the customer back through all the eligibility steps, by going to the </span></span></span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://microsoft.com/home-use-program/home" target="_blank"><span><span>Microsoft Home Use Program</span></span></a></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> and entering in their work email address and following all the correct steps to become eligible.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>After selecting <strong><span>Buy Now,</span></strong> if the customer sees the full price in the Microsoft Store cart, make sure they&rsquo;re signed in with an eligible HUP personal Microsoft account. &nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Can I share my subscription purchased through Home Use Program with members of my household?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> If you have a&nbsp;Microsoft 365 Family subscription, you can share it with up to five additional members of your household (up to six users total). Each household member can install across their devices including PCs, Macs, iPads, Android tablets, Windows tablets, iPhones, or Android phones get 1TB of OneDrive storage, and manage their own installs from </span></span></span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/services/" target="_blank"><span><span>https://account.microsoft.com/services/</span></span></a></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Which email account do I use to install or manage Microsoft 365 and my subscription?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Always use your personal Microsoft account to install Microsoft 365, manage your subscription, and sign into Microsoft 365 on your personal devices. Your Microsoft account is your personal email address, not your corporate email address. Log in to account.microsoft.com and select <strong>Services/Subscriptions</strong> to access or manage your subscription.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How do I renew my Microsoft 365 subscription?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> When you start your Microsoft 365 subscription, recurring billing is already on, and we will bill you automatically until cancelled. If you cancel or turn off recurring billing, you can renew your subscription at </span></span></span><span><span><span><span><a href="https://products.office.com/buy-office-365-home" target="_blank"><span><span>www.office.com/renew</span></span></a></span></span></span></span><span><span><span>.
