<p><span><span><span><span>A CSP Partner contacts Partner frontline support requesting a</span></span></span><span><span><span> CPE credit for one of their customer&rsquo;s their online service. CPE (Customer and Partner Experience) relates to the goal of becoming more customer-focused and connecting with customers and partners. A CPE credit can be used to help retain a customer who is dissatisfied with a service or with their support experience.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="2" name="2"></a>Policy </span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>CPE credits can be used to help retain a CSP customer who is dissatisfied with the service or with their support experience. CSP support team is authorized to approve CPE credits according to the thresholds and approved scenarios listed in this document.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>This policy and process are for CSP subscriptions sold to Direct CSP partners or Indirect Provider CSP partners <u>only</u>. It is therefore very important that the credit request is submitted by the CSP partner (not by the end customer or the Indirect Reseller), along with all the required information, such as the </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/LegacyUploaded_BemisRepository/Bemis/KMSFiles/KBGRAPHICS/OUTSOURCER/EN-US/4023102/CSP%20Credit%20Refund%20Form.docx" managed-link="" target="_blank">CSP credit refund form</a> downloadable from Partner Center.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If the CPE credit is approved, Microsoft will process the credit onto the CSP Partner&rsquo;s account (the credit is normally visible on next month&rsquo;s invoice). It is the partner&rsquo;s responsibility to provide credit to their customer(s).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p>A CPE credit can be used to help retain a customer who is dissatisfied with a service or with their support experience with a confirmed technical issue (bug) not covered by SLA. Some examples:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><span>Customers may receive a CPE credit for bugs that result in data loss. </span></li>
				<li><span>Customers may receive a CPE credit for systemic issues resulting in the inability to use a portion of their service over time that did not breach SLA in a given month. </span></li>
				<li><span>Multiple SIEs over the course of many months eroding customer confidence in a product</span></li>
				<li><span>Customers may potentially receive a CPE credit when a portion of a Suite Sku is unavailable in a sovereign cloud or provisioned into the incorrect service instance.</span></li>
				<li><span>A Service is not correctly provisioned in GCC (in the standard Service by error) and has been in use by the customer.</span></li>
				<li><span>Microsoft committed to a service availability date in a Go-Local or Sovereign cloud and the availability was not met. Where the customer purchased in anticipation of that date. </span></li>
				<li><span>A service, feature or capability is deprecated by Microsoft which will result in significant effort on behalf of the customer and proper notice was not given for the deprecation. </span></li>

			<ul>

			<p>Example 1: customer transitioning to another partner and a discounted offer (like D365 SMB) is no longer available.</p>

			<p><span><span>New reseller will provision the existing offer at full price.</span></span></p>

			<p><span><span>Once new subscription is active,&nbsp;a discount can be applied to align to old pricing (= SMB offer price) but only until the <strong><u>original subscription end date</u></strong> </span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span>Example 2: customer might decide to move all their subscriptions to a new tenant. Since MSFT doesn&rsquo;t offer any subscription transition capability for license-based offers, the customer will have to repurchase all the services. If customer had a retired offer on the old tenant (like D365 SMB), they will have to buy an existing offer at full price. Once new subscription is active, a discount can be applied to align to the old pricing but only until the <strong>original subscription end date.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span>Example 1: partner might have agreed on a special pricing approved by Partner Business Desk. If partner gets charged differently, we must honor whatever pricing is stated in the DAF. See more details in article id </span></span></span>4038716,<span><span><span> section Discounts / Special pricing.</span></span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><span>Example 2: if Price list says that offer xyz is priced at $10 per unit/month, but then the same offer is priced at $12 per unit/month in the PC catalog, MSFT has a contractual obligation to give partners a 30-day notice period before introducing any price changes. In this situation, we must honor the price list price even if it was incorrect.</span></span></span></span></p>
