This article provides a brief overview of wireless access points, and instructions to configure your wireless base station. <br><br><a managed-link="" href='#1' target="" bookmark-id='1'>back to the top</a><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='3'></a>Overview of Access Points</h3>With a wireless access point, computers that have wireless network adapters can  connect to each other and to computers on the wired (Ethernet) section of the network. Wireless base stations and routers include a built-in access point to provide wireless functionality. When a wireless base station is set up to function only as an access point, it functions as a bridge, creating connections between two separate segments of your network. In this case, the access point creates connections between the 802.11b wireless  network segment and the Ethernet network segments. <br><br><br>This is similar to how a hub or switch works. However, a wireless access point works with wireless connections instead of Ethernet connections. You can configure newer wireless routers, such as the Microsoft MN-500 Wireless Base Station, either as a router or a bridge. <br><br>A base station configured as a router protects your network with a firewall and Network Address Translation (NAT) features. A base station configured as a router also controls how computers on your wireless and Ethernet networks connect to each other and the Internet. When a wireless base station is configured in bridge mode, the base station becomes a simple access point. With this access point, wireless computers can  communicate directly with the Ethernet network. All security features are disabled and the base station cannot control how your computers use the network. The wireless base station also stops assigning IP addresses through DHCP, so either you must have an existing DHCP server, or you must assign static IP addresses to all devices on your network. <br><br><br><div class='indent'><span class='text-base'>Important: </span>While the base station is in bridging mode, you cannot access the Base Station Management Tool to modify your settings. To return your base station to the default router mode of operation, or to change your access point settings, reset the base station to its factory default settings. </div><br><span>For additional information about how to reset the base station, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br><div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-1' href='/EN-US/help/331949'>331949 </a> MSBBN: How to Reset the Base Station <br></div></span><a managed-link="" href='#1' target="" bookmark-id='1'>back to the top</a><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='4'></a> Add an Access Point to Your Network</h3>There are many possible network configurations for   access points. Most common network setups belong to  one of the following two scenarios:<ul class='sbody-free_list'><li><span class='text-base'>Add Wireless Functionality to an Existing Network</span> You have a working Ethernet network and you just want to allow access to the network from computers that use 802.11b-compatible wireless network adapters.<br><br></li><li><span class='text-base'>Configure Wireless-Only Access to a Broadband Modem</span>  <br> You have a broadband modem that includes built-in security features such as a firewall or NAT. You want to use 802.11b-compatible wireless network adapters on all computers that connect to the Internet through your modem.<br><br></li></ul>The configuration options for these two scenarios are very similar. When you add an access point to an existing Ethernet network, you connect your wireless base station to an existing router or gateway on your network. If you are not using any Ethernet computers on your network, you can connect the wireless base station in bridge mode directly to the broadband modem.<br>  <br><br><br><a managed-link="" href='#1' target="" bookmark-id='1'>back to the top</a><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='5'></a> Security Considerations</h3>Make sure that you have a firewall to protect your computers from unwanted intruders on the Internet. Make sure that you have a network device between your computers and the Internet to provide network security. In bridge mode, the base station does not provide this type of protection.<br><br>With the access point, you can use Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) to protect your wireless signals from eavesdroppers. However, WEP does nothing to protect your computers from hackers and viruses that enter through your Internet connection.<br><br><a managed-link="" href='#1' target="" bookmark-id='1'>back to the top</a><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='6'></a> Configure the Base Station as an Access Point</h3>The following steps show the first-time setup of a Microsoft Wireless Base Station as a wireless access point. With these steps, you connect the Wireless Base Station to a computer for configuration, and then connect the Wireless Base Station to the base station, router, or gateway. The  base station, router, or gateway is connected to your broadband modem.<br><br>To configure the Wireless Base Station as a wireless access point, follow these steps:<ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Connect the Wireless Base Station to a computer for configuration. Because it is more secure, set up the base station  through a wired connection first, and then switch to a wireless connection.  For information about how to do this, see the User&#39;s Guide for the Wireless Base Station. <br></li><li>Start the Base Station Management Tool.  In the logon box, type your password. <br><br>The default password is <span class='sbody-userinput'>admin</span>.</li><li>Click <strong class='uiterm'>Wireless</strong>, and then click to select  the <strong class='uiterm'>Enable wireless access</strong> check box. <br></li><li>If you want to change the wireless channel, click a number in the <strong class='uiterm'>Wireless channel number</strong>  list box. <br></li><li>If you want to change the network name, type a new network name in the <strong class='uiterm'>Wireless network name (SSID)</strong> box. <br><br>The network name is case sensitive and cannot be greater than 32 characters. <br></li><li>To save your changes, click <strong class='uiterm'>Apply</strong>. <br></li><li>In the Base Station Management Tool, click <strong class='uiterm'>Security</strong> in the right pane. <br><br><br>The <strong class='uiterm'>Security</strong> menu appears in the center pane.</li><li>If you want to use WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) security on this access point, follow these steps:  <br><ol class='sbody-alpha_list'><li>On the <br><strong class='uiterm'>Security</strong> menu, click <strong class='uiterm'>Wireless Security</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong class='uiterm'>Enable wireless security</strong>. <br></li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>Encryption strength</strong> list box, click either <strong class='uiterm'>128-bit</strong> or <strong class='uiterm'>64-bit</strong>. <br></li><li>In the first (upper left) <strong class='uiterm'>Key</strong> box, type an encryption key. <br><br>Encryption keys contain hexadecimal digits that are numbers 0 through 9 or letters in the range A through F. <br></li><li>If you selected 64-bit encryption, set the key index to <span class='sbody-userinput'>1</span> in the <strong class='uiterm'>Key index</strong>  list box. The key index number indicates which of up to four WEP keys are enabled on the network. <br></li><li>To enable the wireless security, click<strong class='uiterm'> Apply</strong>.</li></ol></li><li>If you want to limit wireless access so that only certain computers can connect, configure MAC filtering now. <br><br>As soon as you turn on bridging, you cannot access the Base Station Management Tool, the interface that you use to configure the Wireless Base Station. For information about how to configure MAC filtering, see the User&#39;s Guide for the Wireless Base Station. <br></li><li>On the <strong class='uiterm'>Security</strong> menu, click <strong class='uiterm'>Network Mode</strong>. <br></li><li>Click to select the <strong class='uiterm'>Bridging Mode</strong> check box. <br></li><li>To save your changes, click <strong class='uiterm'>Apply</strong>. When you are prompted to confirm the switch to bridging mode, click <strong class='uiterm'>OK</strong> to continue. <br><br><br>The base station resets itself, and then the base station enters bridging mode. The Base Station Management Tool stops functioning.<br></li><li>When the power LED light  on the base station turns solid green to indicate that the reset is complete,  turn off the computer and the base station. <br></li><li>Turn on the base station, and then turn on the computer.<br></li><li>Move the wireless base station to the location where you want it. Use an Ethernet cable to connect   to the base station, router, or gateway that is connected to your broadband modem. <br><br>Because the wireless base station is now functioning as a wireless access point, it does not have to be connected directly to a computer with an Ethernet cable.</li></ol><a managed-link="" href='#1' target="" bookmark-id='1'>back to the top</a><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='7'></a>Troubleshoot</h3><br><span class='text-base'>Problem</span> You have two Microsoft base stations. One base station functions as a router, and one base station  functions as an access point. The network has problems staying connected with your wireless computers.<br><br><span class='text-base'>Solution</span> Both base stations may be using the same internal IP address of 192.168.2.1. To resolve this problem, change the local area network (LAN) IP address of the wireless access point to a different IP address. Make sure that this new IP address is outside  the range of IP addresses that you use for your computers. For example, you can configure the access point to use the LAN IP address of 192.168.2.50 and keep your router as 192.168.2.1.<br><br><a managed-link="" href='#1' target="" bookmark-id='1'>back to the top</a></div><div class='kb-securedata-section section'>Author:<br>Writer: v-bobbid <br>Tech Reviewer: v-grantw<br> Editor: v-dianag</div>
