<h3><span lang="EN-GB">What is this article about?</span></h3>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong>This procedure describes Advisory Support for Microsoft Unified Support customers &amp; Premier customers.</p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Advisory Services is an hourly fee-based or pre-packaged service, consultative support option that provides proactive support beyond the Customer&#39;s break-fix product maintenance needs. This support option includes working with a CSS Engineer for assistance on issues like product migration, code review, or new program development.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This service is typically used for shorter engagements and is designed for developers and IT professionals who do not require the traditional onsite consulting or sustained account management services that are available from other Microsoft support options.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Engineer scopes issue with the customer and determines the incident type is Advisory based on the definitions for Advisory Services and Break/Fix issue.</li>
	<li>Ensure case is correctly coded as Advisory.
	<ul>
		<li>For cases in Rave
		<ul>
			<li><span lang="EN-GB">For online cases no action is required as there is no way to differentiate Advisory or Reactive type.</span></li>
			<li>For on-premise cases, Case Type should be set to Advisory.</li>

			</div>
			</div>
			</li>
			<li>
			<p>In Rave there is no way to change the entitlement of a case. Even if you were able to change the eligibility from Reactive Incident to Advisory in the corresponding SD shadow case, it would not change the entitlement of the Rave case.</p>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>For cases in Service Desk
		<ul>
			<li>For Premier cases, CSS support engineers should confirm with IM before changing case eligibility. It is not necessary to get IM approval to change case type to Advisory for Unified Support cases.</li>
			<li>In Service Desk, Case Types are directly related to the entitlement used on a case. Depending on the entitlement selected for the case, Service Desk will resolve the Case Type to Reactive Incident, Advisory, Support Consulting, or Developer Consulting. All Broad Commercial/ Professional cases are default to Reactive Incident and can&#39;t be associated to Advisory.</li>

<h3><a id="Proc3" name="Proc3"></a>3. Supporting&nbsp;information or articles</h3>

<div class="divvalue">
<p>If you find that a Unified Support case would take longer than 6 hours after initial scoping, it is only valid to split the case into multiple cases if there are distinctly separate scopes. You cannot break up one single Advisory topic into multiple 6-hour cases. If the support case cannot be supported, then:</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li>For Unified Core Support:
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
		<li>Engineer explains to the customer the Advisory Support scope and ask them if they want a Microsoft rep to contact them. If no, the Engineer closes the case.</li>
		<li>If yes, the Engineer let the Support Account Coordinator team (sacteam@microsoft.com) know about the opportunity and closes the case.</li>
		<li>SAC team will help identify the assigned seller who will follow up with the customer. Custom Proactive is not available to Core customers.</li>
