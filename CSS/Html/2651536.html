<header><h1>ASMS – How to Edit and Re-enable a Subscription</h1></header><p>Submit a <a href="http://sharepoint/sites/fastrack/Lists/ModTrack/NewForm.aspx?RootFolder=">ModTrack</a> request to update this TSG.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>This TSG provides guidance on how to re-enable both invoice and credit card subscriptions, when the customer is unable to do so via the self-serve option in the portal.</p>

<h3><strong><a name="_Hlk496687051"></a>Policy</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Subscriptions suspended by ART/Risk/HIT/ Fraud can only be re-enabled by ART. ASMS does not have permissions to re-enable, please escalate to ART for these re-enablement&rsquo;s.</li>
	<li>When a subscription is disabled, the customer&rsquo;s running applications are affected.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Azure Cloud Services will be removed.</li>
		<li>VMs will be put into a stopped state.</li>
		<li>SQL services will be read only.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1">However, when a subscription is re-enabled, the subscription will continue to be consumed at the same location. Customers will have to redeploy their cloud services as they would have been deleted and restart their VMs.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Note:</strong> Storage services are untouched when a subscription is disabled.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A new Subscription Anniversary (SA) date will be assigned to subscriptions that have been re-enabled.&nbsp;The number of days (interval) in which the subscription was suspended, will be added to the original SA date.&nbsp;Any Anniversary date falling on the 29th, 30th, or 31st&nbsp;will result in the SA date being set to the 1st&nbsp;of the following month.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Example:</strong></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li class="indent-1">The customer&#39;s original Subscription Anniversary is the 25th.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">The subscription was suspended on 10/3&nbsp;and re-enabled on 10/9.&nbsp;</li>
	<li class="indent-1">The subscription was disabled for 6 days (interval of 6).</li>
	<li class="indent-1">The interval is then added to the original SA, and the sum becomes the new SA date (25+6=31).</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Note</strong>: In this example, since the SA date is now greater than 28, the new SA date will be the 1st of the following month.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="Helping Customers Recover from a Subscription Disablement" name="Helping Customers Recover from a Subscription Disablement"></a>Helping Customers Recover from a Subscription Disablement</strong></h4>

<p>When a customer&#39;s subscription has been re-enabled, the customer may need technical assistance. For example, the customer may need assistance re-deploying their Cloud Services (which is deleted when the subscription is disabled) or recovering their IP addresses (which is deleted unless the customer is using Reserved IPs).</p>

<p>In these instances, Support Engineers (SEs) should open a new case on behalf of the customer and route it to the correct Azure Technical Support team queue. ASMS is not equipped or trained to provide technical support to customers, so we should not attempt to assist the customer beyond this point.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Customer Experience and Provisioning" name="Customer Experience and Provisioning"></a>Customer Experience and Provisioning</strong></h3>

<p>Customers&rsquo; subscriptions are disabled when the following have occurred:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Payment has not been received and they are disabled for non-payment.
	<ul>
		<li>Missing Payment for Invoice Customers: Customer states the payment has been made but is not showing for subscription or was misapplied. Refer to TSG - <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646868" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How to handle misapplied payments</a>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Customer has abused the Terms of Use.</li>
	<li>Customer&rsquo;s subscription expired at the end of term (Auto-renewal was not set).</li>
	<li>Customer has exhausted their subscription monetary credits.</li>
	<li>Customer accidently canceled their subscription.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following methods of payment are how customers can settle their outstanding account balance (The method of payment is based on the account type settings and location).</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Credit Card Customers:</strong>&nbsp; To update or add a new credit card, customers will need to do so via the Azure Portal.&nbsp; Public facing guidance can be found <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/change-credit-card" managed-link="" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Invoice Customers: </strong>Mail in a check &ndash; Refer the customer to the payment instructions on their invoice as checks aren&rsquo;t accepted in every country.</li>
	<li><strong>Invoice Customers:</strong> Send in a wire transfer - Refer the customer to the information as noted on their invoice. See TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658076/AzureSupport-WireTransferAccountsandPaymentAddresses">2658076</a> for more details.</li>

			<p>Customers should attempt to settle their balance on the account via the self-serve option in the Account portal.</p>

			<p>Use the following document to walk the customer through the self-serve portal experience: <u><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/SSIS.pdf" target="_blank">SSIS.pdf</a></u></p>

			<p><strong>Note</strong>: The customer self-serve functionality for immediate settle is designed to work even if the subscriptions have been disabled for non-payment as part of the dunning process, as long as the unpaid charge is not yet in the <strong>WriteOff</strong> state.</p>

			<p>If the customer is <strong>unable to self-serve </strong>in the portal take the following actions:</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Ask the customer to provide screenshots of the errors they are receiving when trying to perform the immediate settle.</li>
				<li>Gather all standard ASE-required data.</li>
				<li>Engage ASE as outlined in TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3093263/azure-support---ase-engagement">3093263</a>.</li>
				<li>While waiting for ASE to investigate, follow these steps to enable the subscription:</li>
			</ol>

			<ul>
				<li>Ensure the customer has a valid CC associated with the subscription. If so,<strong> enable subscription. If not, w</strong>ork with the customer to get a PI associated before enabling.</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Note: </strong>If the credit card has become banned, but it&#39;s their only card, you can try to unban the PI in CMAT and try charging the PI again. For more details follow TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4010492" target="_blank">Unban PI</a>.</p>

			<ol>
				<li>In CMAT, navigate to the <strong>Payment Instrument</strong> view to complete an immediate settlement of the charges.</li>
				<li>Expand the payment instrument linked to the service with the past due balance.</li>
				<li>Click the <strong>Settle Balance</strong>* icon in the bottom of the pane.</li>
			</ol>

			<p><strong>No</strong><strong>te</strong>: This action will settle ALL charges associated with the credit card, including O365 and any other Microsoft services the customer may have running. We do not have visibility into where the charges are from presently. So be sure to let the customer know if you see other charges that aren&#39;t in line with Azure and get permission from the customer prior to settling the balance.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>If the number of transactions are less than 20, process using CMAT.</li>
				<li>If <strong>Immediate settle</strong> fails through CMAT, verify the CC has the proper limit to settle and then retry the operation in CMAT. If it still fails, escalate to your TA/PTA so they can check the reason for card failure.</li>
				<li>If number of transactions is more than 20, escalate to your TA/PTA to settle.&nbsp; If the customer has questions on the Non-azure charges at the time of immediate settle, escalate to PayOps.
				<p>If the credit card can&#39;t accept the charge due to amount, PayOps can do a split charge. Escalate to Payops for the split charge.</p>
				</li>
				<li>Check <strong>Split Payment Option limitations</strong> under <strong>Customer is in dunning and their subscription has been disabled for nonpayment AND they don&rsquo;t have a cc that can clear the charges (i.e. the credit limit is too low, etc.) AND wants to make a one-time payment via invoice or wire transfer, or a split payment between 2 credit cards</strong> section of this TSG before offering this to the customer.</li>

			<p class="ExternalClassC9D7E9960A104C2AAC49008404A06E66">Split Payment is a one-time courtesy option provided by PayOps, when a customer is unable to settle a balance using a single transaction. There are two options for splitting a payment:</p>

			<div class="ExternalClassC9D7E9960A104C2AAC49008404A06E66">
			<ul>
				<li>Split the payment using two credit cards.</li>
				<li>Split the payment over 2-3 transactions using one credit card. &nbsp;
				<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
					<li>Splitting the charges multiple times tampers with the invoice, so set the customer&#39;s expectations accordingly.</li>
					<li>Do not accept requests where the customer wants to split the charges to more than three transactions (e.g. split $10,000 in 10 transactions of $1000 each) unless there is a strong business justification. Always consult with your TA in these instances, so they can add their approval to the PayOps ticket to avoid denied requests.</li>

<h4>To better understand the Settle Balance feature, review the terms and defintions below:&nbsp;</h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Open Balance:</strong> A customer&#39;s current unbilled charges that incurred based on the daily consumption of the services deployed.</li>
	<li><strong>Ready Balance:</strong> The amount that is currently invoiced. This will include any requested amounts that are already being declined on the PI or in Delayed Writeoff.</li>
	<li><strong>Process Balance:</strong> The act of processing a balance, in which the Open Balance amount moves to Ready Balance.</li>
	<li><strong>Settle Balance:</strong> The act of settling the current outstanding amount that shows up under Ready Balance on the customer&rsquo;s desired PI.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Note</strong>: Settle Balance will settle ALL charges associated with the credit card, including O365 and any other Microsoft services the customer may have running. We currently do not have visibility into where the charges are from. So be sure to let the customer know if you see other charges that aren&#39;t in line with Azure and get permission from the customer prior to settling the balance.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Process Exceptions" name="Process Exceptions"></a>Process Exceptions</strong></p>

<p>If the customer is an EA customer and they have an old charge associated with their MOSP subscription (that is in the same account as their EA subscription account) and are in good standing, re-enable the customer and assist them with refunding the charges (if within your empowerment, TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3084129/azure-support---applying-credits-refunds-in-cmat">3084129</a>) or assist with a latent onboarding credit (TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2909478/azure-support---ea-latent-onboarding-credit-request">2909478</a>).</p>

<h3><strong>Azure Internal offer subscription re-instate process</strong></h3>

<p>If you receive any subscription re-enable request for Azure Internal Consumption offer, please ensure to check in AIRS registration site (<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/airs" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://aka.ms/airs</a>) to verify that the Account Admin has an active AIRS registration. Only then re-instate.</p>

<p>If no active registration found or if you have any doubts to proceed with re-instating the subscription, please reach out to AIRS escalation &quot;Azure Internal Offer (MSFT only)&quot; per TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2927087/azure-support-team-engagement" managed-link="" target="_blank">2927087.</a></p>

<h4><strong><a id="How to Re-enable a Subscription" name="How to Re-enable a Subscription"></a>How to Re-enable a Subscription</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>The subscription status will be noted as Disabled in CMAT (it will show as Canceled on the customer&rsquo;s Account Portal on azure.microsoft.com)</li>
	<li>After 90 days, the subscription status will be noted as Deprovisioned. this state indicates the data is permanently deleted and cannot be recovered. (It will no longer show at all on the customer&rsquo;s Account Portal). At this point, subscriptions cannot be re-enabled.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Select the <strong>subscription</strong> that you want to re-enable in CMAT.</p>

<p><img border="0" src=" https://internalasset.blob.core.windows.net/asset/kbgraphics/outsourcer/en-us/azure/2651536/2.png"></p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Select <strong>Reinstate</strong> Subscription.</p>

<p><img border="0" src=" https://internalasset.blob.core.windows.net/asset/kbgraphics/outsourcer/en-us/azure/2651536/3.png"></p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Enter <strong>comments</strong> and select <strong>arrow</strong> to proceed to next screen.</p>

<p><img border="0" src=" https://internalasset.blob.core.windows.net/asset/kbgraphics/outsourcer/en-us/azure/2651536/4.png"></p>

<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Enter the <strong>Service Request</strong> (SR) number and select the <strong>check bo</strong><strong>x </strong>to proceed to the next screen.</p>

<p><img border="0" src=" https://internalasset.blob.core.windows.net/asset/kbgraphics/outsourcer/en-us/azure/2651536/5.png"></p>

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Confirm that the status has been changed to <strong>Active</strong>.</p>

<p><img border="0" src=" https://internalasset.blob.core.windows.net/asset/kbgraphics/outsourcer/en-us/azure/2651536/6.png"></p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Follow the steps below to verify that the customer&rsquo;s subscription is fully active:</p>

<ol>
	<li>In CMAT, check that Subscriptions Status, Entitlement Status, and Fulfillment Status are all set to <strong>Active</strong>.</li>
	<li>In Jarvis, run <strong>AzureRT / Subscription Management / Get Subscription With Details</strong> to check for <strong>SubscriptionStatus:Active </strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note 1:</strong> All four statuses in CMAT and Jarvis must show <strong>Active</strong>. If not, the subscription should not be considered fully active and you should engage PayOps (TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2651579/azure-support---payops-engagement">2651579</a>, <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3030324/azure-support---handling-subscription-disabled-cases">3030324</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Note 2:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Keep in mind that once the subscription has been fully re-enabled, a new Subscription Anniversary date will be assigned to the subscription as outlined in the Policy section of this TSG.&nbsp;</p>
