			<p><strong>Inactivate account</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p><span><span><span>This can be done in the UI by selecting <strong>Deactivate</strong>. This is also performed in cases of system deactivation, typically occurring when an account has not had spend for 15 months or longer. Both manual and system deactivation result in an <strong>inactive</strong> account status and make the account inactive.</span></span></span></p>

			<p>Manual deactivation is typically done only if the customer has no plans of using the specific account in the future, but desires to maintain their customer shell.&nbsp;Customers can deactivate an account themselves or it may be done systematically. Once deactivation occurs, only CSS support teams can determine reactivation eligibility before switching the account to active.</p>

			<p>Deactivating requires that the customer pay any open balance and customers with prepaid funds will be refunded at time of deactivation. An alternative to deactivating is to simply pause the campaigns, which will stop ads from running and charges from accumulating.</p>

			<p>Fraud customers are not eligible for CID deletion via support and should be directed to the Privacy Response Center per KB&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4094951" managed-link="" target="_blank">4094951 Procedure: Privacy: Handling data subject rights requests</a>.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>This is the permanent deletion of the customer account or customer shell.&nbsp;This is a change that cannot be performed by the customer or CSS. Once complete, it cannot be reversed by Global Support or Engineering, so be sure the advertiser requires a permanent deletion before any request to partners is made.&nbsp;Deletion is not necessary to prevent an account from active status, and deactivating is typically a preferable option, giving customers some flexibility and historic account access.</p>

			<p>Customer deletion will also delete all information associated with the account, and there will be no way for us to retrieve this information for a customer later. Consider this change carefully with the customer as changes will implicate accounts linked to the primary customer shell.&nbsp;</p>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
			<p><strong>Reactivating account</strong></p>
			</td>
			<td>
			<p>This can be done only if the account was previously inactivated (not deleted).</p>

			<p>To verify if the customer is eligible for a reactivation, first locate their account in the UI.&nbsp;If you can pull up their account, check for a banner notification stating their account is at risk for deletion and to contact support. If there is a banner notice or the customer has received an email stating their account will be deleted, they are part of the Account Cancellation process and should only be reactivated after the NQS team reviews their account for eligibility. If they do not have a banner, have spend in the last 15 months, and no email was received, they are eligible for reactivation per normal process (select reactivate). If you are unable to locate their account, it means the account or shell has been deleted from the system and cannot be retrieved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span><span>Before choosing which option to take, ask the advertiser if they want to later access any of their Microsoft Advertising data. In most cases, it&rsquo;s recommended that customers pause or deactivate their account. After 15 months of no spend, their account will be put into an inactive state and will be earmarked for deletion in the months that follow. Never recommend deletion for a customer that desires to access future data. Deleting a customer account is a process only available to Global Support and should be used in rare situations. It is recommended that we offer instead the process that makes the campaigns or account status inactive.</span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><a id="4" name="4"></a>4. Account cancellation</span></span></span></h3>

<h4><span><span><span><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 Account cancellation pilot</span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span>As of July 2020, there is an effort to move non-spending accounts for proposed deletion. Old accounts which have not spent within a 15-month timeframe, will be system deactivated and (if no action is taken to spend or contact support for reactivation) later permanently deleted. Any concerns from customers or unexpected push back can be escalated for visibility to NQS (see template below). </span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><span><span>What changed:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>On July 17th, Microsoft Advertising updated our System Policy section </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/relevance-and-quality-policies" managed-link="" target="_blank">here</a> <span> </span><span><span>to include notice of our ability to deactivate or delete customer accounts that have been inactive for over 15 months. This change serves as official notice to customers that deactivation may occur on accounts that do not incur spend within that timeframe. Customers desiring a historical view of changes to our policies can </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/microsoft-advertising-policies-change-log" managed-link="" target="_blank">view the log here </a><span> </span><span><span>(under July 2020). By removing unused accounts, Microsoft is helping to protect our customers data, privacy and retains optimum platform performance. System deactivation differs from elective account deactivation that is performed by the advertiser or CSS, it is done on the backend to select accounts deemed inactive for a period of time. To be reactivated, customers with a system deactivation notice need to contact support for assistance and, if CSS deems the account eligible for reactivation, the fraud team must conduct a review of the account and requestor, before CSS initiates reactivation. In the event reactivation does not occur, the accounts will be marked for permanent deletion at a future date. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><span><span>What to expect:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>When a customer account is impacted by systematic deactivation, both internal and external users will see the banner &ldquo;<em>For security purposes, this account has been deactivated</em>&rdquo; &ndash; example below. This is the only way internal users can distinguish between standard deactivation (initiated by the customer) and system deactivation. Along with this banner, the Super Admin will be notified via email (via alerts set on the account). At this point, customers may elect to contact support requesting reactivation of their account or have questions about what the notice means.</span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><a id="4.2" name="4.2"></a>4</span></span><span><span>.2 What CSS can do</span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span>If a customer contacts support to request reactivation, CSS must follow standard process for authenticating the customer on every account. Unlike standard reactivation requests, a system reactivation process requires that CSS first manually vet the account as eligible for reactivation. Reactivation is <strong>not</strong> a guarantee until after CSS has conducted an initial review to confirm historic spend <strong>and</strong> the fraud team has approved reactivation. Set customer expectations appropriately that escalation for review of reactivation does not guarantee reactivation. As a alternative, customers can create a new account.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Different and appropriate coding in ASD should be used when customers are seeking reactivation due to system deactivation. Follow the L4 option of &ldquo;Deactivated &ndash; pending deletion&rdquo; whenever there is a customer inquiry related to an identified system deactivated account.</span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><a id="4.3" name="4.3"></a>4.3 CSS review</span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span>Customers desiring to maintain their system deactivated account, must not be reactivated by CSS until an NQS review is conducted. To determine this, CSS must follow the below protocol:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Check for historic spend: Using the billing tab or UCM, alter filter for the account to <strong>Entire Time</strong> and confirm if there is historic account spend.</span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>If <strong>yes</strong> &ndash; Customer is eligible for fraud review for reactivation.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>If <strong>no</strong> &ndash; Customer is <strong>not</strong> eligible for fraud review. Deliver deactivation denied messaging.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>If <strong>customer persists</strong> &ndash; Customers that are adamant that they <strong>must</strong> retain the account for some other purpose should be advised to copy their information over to another account. If this does not suffice, CSS may send to the fraud team for review.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If <strong>eligible</strong>, send for NQS review: Include reference to &lsquo;System Deactivation Review Requested&rsquo; in the escalation to NQS.</span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>Using the escalation template below, include confirmation of historical spend and reason for reactivation review.</span></span></span></span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Issue Category</span></span></strong><span><span>: NQS &ndash; Traffic Quality Escalations</span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span>If an escalation to NQS is warranted (historic spend is showing on the account), this must be approved by NQS. Once approved, CSS may follow standard protocol for reactivating the customer&#39;s account, using the <strong>Reactivate</strong> button. Always confirm with the customer if they desire to resume spend or not. Customers who are not eligible for reactivation (they do not meet the spend criteria) should be given the following message:</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><em><span><span>&ldquo;Dear &lt;advertiser name&gt;</span></span></em></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><em><span><span>Thank you for your patience as we investigated your account reactivation request. For safety and security reason, we are unable to reactivate your account.

<h3><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. FAQ</h3>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: Can you close my account for me?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>Yes, but let&#39;s make sure this is the right option. Do you ever plan on using this account again? If so, I can help you pause it. If you never intend to use it again, I can help you inactivate it. This will make it show as inactive in the UI. There is no way to delete/close at account level. To do this:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>All existing campaigns must be paused. </span></span></strong></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Any remaining balance must be settled before an account can be closed. If you want to settle your charges, I can force bill your credit card now or you can select the Bill Me Now function. Force bill requests are processed immediately. Otherwise, all current charges will be billed to your credit card during the current billing cycle. If your account has a billing address in India, I cannot perform the force bill; you must perform the Bill Me Now function yourself in the user interface. I am happy to walk you through this process.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Be aware that your account will be listed as <strong>Inactive</strong>.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: Why does my account remain listed as Inactive?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Your account is listed as Inactive so that you have the option of referencing your account information if you need it in the future. There is no way to delete an account. The only way to permanently delete is at the customer level. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: I know that I will never have to access my account information again. Can you completely remove my account from the system?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A: </strong>There is currently no way to remove an inactive account from the account list. We apologize for any inconvenience that this might cause. The only way to permanently delete an account is at the customer level. Doing this will permanently delete all accounts under the customer shell and permanently delete all historical data associated with the account. This information can never be retrieved once the deletion is processed. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Q: I still receive Microsoft Advertising email messages even though my account is closed. Can you completely remove me from your contact lists?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>A:</strong> Unfortunately, we cannot opt you out of critical alerts. The only way to do this is to delete the account entirely, which will permanently delete all information within the account.</span></span></span></p>
