When you use the software restriction policies, you can identify and specify the software that is allowed to run so that you can protect your computer environment from untrusted code. When you use the software restriction policies, you can define a default security level of <span class='text-base'>Unrestricted</span> or <span class='text-base'>Disallowed</span> for a Group Policy object (GPO) so that software is either allowed or not allowed to run by default. To create exceptions to this default security level, you can create rules for specific software. You can create the following types of rules: <br> <ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Hash rules</li><li>Certificate rules</li><li>Path rules</li><li>Internet zone rules</li></ul> A policy is made up of the default security level and all of the rules applied to a GPO. This policy can apply to all of the computers or to individual users. The software restriction policies provide a number of ways to identify software, and they provide a policy-based infrastructure to enforce decisions about whether the software can run. With the software restriction policies, users must follow the guidelines that are set up by administrators when they run programs. <br><br> With the software restriction policies, you can perform the following tasks: <br> <ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Control which programs can run on your computer. For example, you can apply a policy that does not allow certain file types to run in the e-mail attachment folder of your e-mail program if you are concerned about users receiving viruses through e-mail.</li><li>Permit users to run only specific files on multiple-user computers. For example, if you have multiple users on your computers, you can set up software restriction policies in such a way that users do not have access to any software except for those specific files that they must use for their work.</li><li>Decide who can add trusted publishers to your computer.</li><li>Control whether software restriction policies affect all users or just certain users on a computer.</li><li>Prevent any files from running on your local computer, your organizational unit, your site, or your domain. For example, if there is a known virus, you can use software restriction policies to stop the computer from opening the file that contains the virus.<br><br><span class='text-base'>Important</span>: We recommend that you do not use software restriction policies as a replacement for antivirus software. </li></ul><a managed-link="" href='#toc' target="" bookmark-id='toc'>back to contents</a><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='2'></a>How to use Software Restriction Policies with AppLocker</h3> Although Software Restriction Policies and AppLocker have the same goal, AppLocker is a complete revision of the software restriction policies that are introduced in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. You cannot use AppLocker to manage the software restriction policy settings. AppLocker rules are only enforced on computers that are running Windows 7 Ultimate and Enterprise editions or all editions of Windows Server 2008 R2, whereas the software restriction policy rules are enforced on these and earlier versions.<br><br>In addition, if AppLocker and the software restriction policy settings are configured in the same GPO, only the AppLocker settings will be enforced on the computers that are running Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2. Therefore, if you must use both Software Restriction Policies and AppLocker in your organization, it is the recommended practice to create AppLocker rules for computers that can use AppLocker policy, and software restriction policy rules for computers that are running earlier versions of Windows.<br><br>For more information about how to use these two software restriction technologies, see the <span class='sbody-italic'>AppLocker</span> topic in the Microsoft TechNet Technical Library: <div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-1' href='http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd723678(ws.10).aspx' target='_self'>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd723678(WS.10).aspx</a></div><a managed-link="" href='#toc' target="" bookmark-id='toc'>back to contents</a><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='3'></a>How to start Software Restriction Policies</h3><h4 class='sbody-h4'><a class='bookmark' id='4'></a>For the Local Computer Only</h4><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Programs</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Administrative Tools</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Local Security Policy</span>.</li><li>In the console tree, expand <span class='text-base'>Security Settings</span>, and then expand <span class='text-base'>Software Restriction Policies</span>.</li></ol><a managed-link="" href='#toc' target="" bookmark-id='toc'>back to contents</a><h4 class='sbody-h4'><a class='bookmark' id='5'></a>For a Domain, a Site, or an Organizational Unit on a Member Server or a Workstation that is joined to a Domain</h4><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Open Microsoft Management Console (MMC).
