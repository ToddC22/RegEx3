<h3><strong><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</strong></h3>

<p>CSP cases which come in with the correct entitlement should be worked by SEs/TA/PTAs that handle Premier, Pro-Direct, and Partner volume.</p>

<p>If you receive a case with such an entitlement and it was incorrectly assigned to your queue (e.g. by the Duty Manager (DM)), move it to the respective&nbsp;ASMS Premier queue (See TSG&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3189895/asms-internal-alias-use-and-ta-pta-alignment" managed-link="" target="_blank">3189895</a>&nbsp;for specific queue names) and email the DM asking them to assign it to a Premier/Pro-Direct/Partner&nbsp;resource. Be sure to re-title the case by adding CSP at the start of the title field.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Refer to TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2786284/asms-support-entitlement-handling">2786284</a> to learn more about handling various entitlements.</p>

<p>Also, some scenarios may be out of scope for ASMS. In those scenarios ASMS should engage with the Region Support Center (RSC) for assistance. For more information on how to engage this team, see the <a bookmark-id="Engagement and Escalation Path" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3078989#Engagement and Escalation Path" managed-link="">Engagement and Escalation Path</a> section at the bottom of this TSG.</p>

<p>Below are a few key details you should know about this offer:</p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>This offer is only available to Partners. </strong>

	<ul>
		<li>Partners are resellers who control the customer&rsquo;s subscriptions.</li>
		<li>ASMS will only assist partners, not customers. Only the Account Admin (Partner) will be able to contact Support. If a customer of one of the partners contacts us, we won&rsquo;t be able to find the email address they contact us with, as the email will more than likely not be associated with anything. In those instances, redirect that customer to contact their partner.
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>If a Partner requests that ASMS reach out to their customer, it is okay to do so as long as the Partner is on <strong>all </strong>customer<strong> </strong>communication interactions. In these instances, the Partner will need to be the first to loop in the customer.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>The partner creates subscription on behalf of their customers and controls everything about them. </strong>
	<ul>
		<li>Partners will be the Admin on behalf of (AOBO) customers and manage customer deployments through Ibiza. However, what the partners will see may differ from what they can do from within Ibiza, based on how the customer has been set up via Role Based Azure Control (RBAC) role assignment.</li>
		<li>By default, customers are the end users of the services running, not the administrators of the subscription. (They have no direct access to the subscription). The Partner manages everything for their customers.</li>
		<li>If the CSP partner user is included in an end Customer AAD tenant as guest, the CSP Subscription is not displayed in Ibiza portal to manage services. The Partner center portal would allow him to click the link to manage services, but the Ibiza portal will not load the Subscription content properly. This is a known by design limitation. In order to display the Subscription content as expected, the CSP Partner user must be removed from the third party AAD tenant as guest. After some minutes, the Subscription will be displayed again correctly.<br>
		In case of further issues, ASE can help to confirm the above cause and identity team could also help to identify the AAD tenant which includes the guest role for the impacted user. As workaround, the CSP Partner could use a different CSP partner user to manage services instead of the one that is also a guest in the other customer&#39;s tenant.</li>
		<li>Partners can add more than one Azure subscription per customer via the partner center portal. Steps on how to do this can be found in the following links:</li>

	</li>
	<li><strong>Security Requirements for CSP</strong></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1">Microsoft is introducing a set of mandatory security requirements for partners participating in the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) program, Control Panel Vendors, and Advisor partners.</p>

<p class="indent-1">The requirements are:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1">Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all partner users (administrators and end-users) of partner tenants at no cost via Azure Active Directory baseline policy.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Implement the secure application model to integrate with Partner Center API and other APIs using app + user authentication such as Microsoft Graph or automation using tools such as PowerShell.</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1">The new security requirements terms will be included to the CSP Program Guide (August 1, 2019) and Microsoft Partner Agreement (available on September 1, 2019).&nbsp;The same security requirements will be enacted for the Advisor program as well.</p>

<p class="indent-1">Partners who fail to abide by these security practices and obligations will not be able to transact in the Cloud Solution Provider program or manage customer tenants leveraging delegate admin rights, once these partner security requirements are enforced.</p>

<p class="indent-1">We are in the process of establishing an enforcement date for the requirements and will notify partners of the date with detailed information.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Customer Experience and Provisioning" name="Customer Experience and Provisioning"></a>Customer Experience and Provisioning</strong></p>

<p>All CSP partners have a tenant in Azure Active Directory (AAD). The process of becoming a CSP partner creates three groups in the partner tenant: AdminAgents, HelpDeskAgents and SalesAgents. The partner administrators populate these groups with employees (users).</p>

<p>When a CSP partner makes a sale, they provision a new subscription for their customer. The customer may already exist in AAD or this may be a new Microsoft cloud customer. In the latter case, the customer is created in AAD and the subscription is provisioned. This could be a seat-based subscription such as Office 365 (O365) or Enterprise Mobility Suite (EMS) or, from July 2015, an Azure Pay-As-You-Go subscription. The operation of provisioning new subscriptions is available to partner-users who are members of the AdminAgents or SalesAgents groups.</p>

<h4><strong>1. </strong><strong>Admin on Behalf of (AOBO)</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>When a partner provisions a subscription, they are automatically provided with the following administrative permissions:
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>The partners AdminAgents group is added to the customer&rsquo;s TenantAdmin role.</li>
		<li>The partners HelpDeskAgents group is added to the customer&rsquo;s UserAdmin role.</li>
		<li>For Azure, the partner&rsquo;s AdminAgents group is made the Owner of the subscription.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>This configuration is modeled by the creation of a Foreign Principal Object (FPO) in the customer directory, representing each of the partner agent groups, and the FPOs are inserted into the customer admin roles. Members of the partner AdminAgents group can then operate on all the partners&rsquo; customers as a tenant admin and on all the partner&rsquo;s Azure subscriptions as a subscription owner.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A partner AdminAgent accessing the Partner Center portal will see a list of their customers. The agent can select a customer and links are made available to allow the agent to navigate to the admin portals for all purchased services (e.g. the O365 admin portal, or Ibiza for Azure.) When the agent navigates to these portals, they will be in the customer&rsquo;s context and see only those subscriptions purchased from the CSP partner by that customer.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Larger CSPs may want to integrate Directory Management with their own customer management systems. AAD PowerShell lets the AAD Graph API support the partner authentication model, providing scriptable/programmable access to the directory. Similarly, partners who want to call Azure PowerShell and REST APIs will need the same capability. Azure PowerShell has added a &ldquo;&shy;&ndash;tenant&rdquo; parameter to support this.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>2. </strong><strong>Multi-tier and Delegated Admin provisioning</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Partners are split into two categories; Partners that deal directly with their customers and those that work through their own reseller channel (Distributors.) In this model the Distributor partner acts as the CSP and provisions the customer subscriptions and is responsible for paying the Microsoft bill.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Resellers (which are also provisioned in AAD as a CSP or Advisor partner) can send an AOBO request to the customer admin. If the customer decides to grant the reseller access, their agent groups are configured in the same way as the CSP partner. The result is that both partners (Distributors and Resellers) have AOBO rights for the customer tenant.</li>
</ul>

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
	<li>To obtain Azure, the Distributor will use Azure PowerShell to add the reseller partner&rsquo;s AdminAgents group as a subscription Owner.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Contributor - Contributors can manage everything except access.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Owner - Owner can manage everything, including access.</li>
	<li class="indent-1">Reader - Readers can view everything but are not eligible to make changes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. Service Availability</strong></p>

<p>Resource management for Azure CSP subscriptions are done using the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Azure Portal</a></li>
	<li>Azure PowerShell (in ARMmode)</li>
	<li>Azure CLI (in ARM mode)</li>
	<li>Azure Resource Management REST API</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>A list of Azure services in CSP can be found on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">the Public facing Azure website</a>.<br>
<strong>Also see: </strong><a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/Release%20Notes%20for%20Azure%20CSP%20-%20Updated%20March%201%202017.docx?d=w4ce477a93e4646cfad1d029099b1a6da">Release Notes for Azure CSP</a></p>

<h4><strong>4. All partners get a 15% discount from retail rates in CSP</strong></h4>

<h4><strong>5. If the Partner has an issue with Azure specifically, they can file a support request via the Ibiza portal</strong></h4>

<p>However, if the customer is requesting assistance with Office 365, Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online, Enterprise Mobility Suite for CSP, the partner can submit a request on behalf of the customer by following the steps outlined <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/report-problems-on-behalf-of-a-customer" managed-link="" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h4><strong>6. All CSP partners have the &#39;Cloud Solution Provider&#39; technical support plan by default</strong></h4>

<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
	<li>The support plan encompasses all their end customers. Partners can add on other support plans and they can then decide which support plan to use when submitting tickets on behalf of their end customers.</li>
	<li>If they can&#39;t file a technical ticket, send them back to the Partner Center to file a request to get it enabled.</li>
	<li>Partners can find the instructions to enable technical support in <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020188/technical-support-for-microsoft-partners?ocid=cs-pcsupport-msporducttechsupport">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4020188/technical-support-for-microsoft-partners?ocid=cs-pcsupport-msporducttechsupport</a></li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>7. Billing/Usage Reports</strong></h4>

<ul>
	<li>Partners manage the billing relationship with their end customers and send their own bills to the customers. Customers will not have access to any billing details from Microsoft, unless provided by the partner. ASMS has no visibility into the billing of the customer.</li>
	<li>The partner is also responsible for paying Microsoft for these subscriptions. A multi-subscription, multi-customer aggregated bill is sent to the partner each month.</li>
	<li>Partners have access to the usage report from the CPC portal. They will need to follow the below steps to obtain this information:</li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li>Search by the partner&#39;s <strong>Tenant GUID</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>arrow</strong> to go into the partner&#39;s profile.</li>
	<li>Within the profile, click the <strong>Billing</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Within the Billing tab, click on <strong>Invoices</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the appropriate usage file by clicking on <strong>First_Party_Azure</strong> for the relevant month.<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> CSP&#39;s usage file is referred to as a &quot;recon file&quot; and contains multiple subscriptions.</li>
	<li>Within the appropriate file, filter on the relevant subscription.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The MPN ID that displays in the recon file references the partner&#39;s&nbsp;subscription. If a partner has concerns about discrepancies of the MPN ID in their recon file, ask them to also check the subscription in the Partner Center,&nbsp;where they can update the MPN ID. If a customer needs assistance using the subscription areas of Partner Center, refer to table in the <strong>Engagement and Escalation Path</strong> section&nbsp;in this article.</p>

<p><strong>Usage console - FTE only</strong><br>
The Usage Console is for looking up CSP related usage. This tool has been available to the TAs and is now available to all FTEs. All FTEs can request access to this tool by following the guidelines in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2651548" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2651548</a>. If you are non-FTE and need access to the CSP usage information, engage a TA/PTA.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once approved, access the tool at <a href="https://adminconsole.usage.cp.microsoft.com/Subscription" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://adminconsole.usage.cp.microsoft.com/Subscription</a>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ensure the Environment is set to <strong>Production</strong>.</li>
	<li>Enter the <em>CSP Subscription GUID</em>, <em>Start Date</em>, and <em>End Dat</em>e.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Download Aggregated Usage</strong> to download the report.</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>8. How to Suspend and Activate&nbsp;a CSP Subscription from the Partner Center Portal:</strong></h4>

<p>Partners can enable and re-enable customer subscriptions via the Partner Center Portal.</p>

<ul>
	<li>To re-activate a subscription, follow the same steps and select <strong>Activate</strong> instead of <strong>Suspend</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>9. How to r</strong><strong>ename CSP subscriptions</strong></h4>

	<li>Select the customer under whom the subscription needs to be renamed.</li>
	<li>Click on the subscription that you would like to rename.</li>
	<li>Update the subscription nickname and click <strong>Submit</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h4><strong>10. Digital Partner of Record (DPOR)</strong></h4>

<p>There is no DPOR functionality&nbsp;on CSP subscriptions. However, a customer&rsquo;s CSP partner will automatically get recognition for the consumption and usage that occurs. CSP consumption and usage will count towards a partner&rsquo;s Cloud Competency Attainment.</p>

<p>CSP partners may also be eligible to earn incentives on CSP usage and consumption. More details on the specific partner incentives are available at: <a href="https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/partner-incentives">https://partner.microsoft.com/en-us/membership/partner-incentives</a></p>

				<li>Search for the subscription in CMAT; this will provide you the <em>Partner Tenant GUID</em> in the search result.</li>
				<li>Copy the <em>Partner Tenant GUID</em> and put it in the search bar under <strong>Tenant GUID</strong> in CMAT.</li>
				<li>Open the search result and navigate to the <strong>Subscriptions tab</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select <strong>reseller</strong> and enter the <em>Customer Tenant ID</em>.&nbsp;</li>
			</ol>

			<ol start="6">
				<li>Expand the <strong>Azure CSP subscription</strong> and click on the <strong>Transactions</strong> option.</li>

				<ul style="list-style-type:disc">

			<p>In this scenario, attempt the following troubleshooting steps:&nbsp;</p>

			<ol>
				<li>Advise the customer to work with their Global Admin on the partner tenant,&nbsp;to enable MFA for the Admin Agent account. In return this should give the Partner the ability to manage&nbsp;customer&#39;s subscriptions.
				<ul>
					<li>Provide the customer with steps on how the to enable MFA. Steps can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/set-up-multi-factor-authentication-for-office-365-users-8f0454b2-f51a-4d9c-bcde-2c48e41621c6" managed-link="" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>If the customer is facing issues setting up MFA after attempting step 1, then engage the Cloud Identity Team (AAD- Authentication Queue). See TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2832928/asms-azure-active-directory-aad" managed-link="" target="_blank">2832928</a>&nbsp;for additional guidance.&nbsp;</li>
			</ol>

			<p><strong>Root Cause of issue:</strong> If the customer tenant has MFA setup (which is added security for all customers logging to the tenant) but the partner Admin Agents who have delegated access to the customer&#39;s tenant do not have MFA setup, then login request to the customer&#39;s tenant for Admin Agents will get denied access.&nbsp;This happens because Admin Agents do not meet the AAD security standards which are set on the customer&#39;s tenant and all login attempts from any user who does not have MFA setup would be denied.</p>

<p><strong>Diagnostics:</strong></p>

<p>Since CSP subscriptions have no RDFE footprint, RDFE operations from Jarvis will not yield any result. For example, the Jarvis command (RDFE &gt; Subscription Management &gt; Get Subscription with Details) will not yield any results. That said, use the operations below to obtain the details about the subscription:</p>

<p><strong>Using Jarvis:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li>In Jarvis, navigate to: Azure Resource Manager/Subscription State Management/Get subscription &quot;quotaId&quot;: &quot;CSP_2015-05-01&quot;</li>
	<li>Ensure that the offer is of the 145 type.</li>
</ol>

<ol>
	<li>For issues that you assess as RSC scope, send a task to your TA to have them review the request and engage the CSP&nbsp;aligned TAs.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
	<li>If it is unclear who owns the scope of the issue, any TA can leverage the accsp@microsoft.com DL to obtain guidance before engaging the CSP&nbsp;aligned TAs.</li>
</ol>

<ul class="indent-1">
	<li>If it is determined that it is ASMS scope, the TA of the originating POD will respond to the SE via the original task providing context and next steps.</li>
	<li>If it is determined that it is RSC scope, the TA of the originating POD will send a task to the CSP aligned TAs requesting the creation of a CAP case and provide the following details:</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There is a 24-hour response SLA from members of this distribution list.</p>

	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
	<li>The CSP TAs will then respond to the original task confirming creation of the (CAP) ticket on the customer&rsquo;s behalf, including providing the CAP case number.&nbsp;They will also&nbsp;regularly check the CAP ticket and update the SD ticket with any CAP case notes.</li>
	<li>The SE (case owner) will then communicate with the customer, letting them know of the next steps. You may consider leveraging this template to update the customer.</li>
