<header><h1>ASMS – First Quality Response</h1></header><p>Submit a <a href="http://sharepoint/sites/fastrack/Lists/ModTrack/NewForm.aspx?RootFolder=">ModTrack</a> request to update this TSG.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>This article describes how to respond to new support cases, with a focus on First Quality Response (FQR). FQR combines Initial Response (IR), Scope, and Solution emails into one email &ndash; the First Contact Resolution (FCR) email. This takes the place of separate IR and scope emails. The focus of the Support Engineer (SE) is to achieve as quick of a resolution as possible rather than just trying to meet the initial response Service Level Agreement (SLA) with a generic email.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Proper FQR should include at least one of the following:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>A solution to the issue.</li>
	<li>A question that requires a response.</li>
	<li>Information that lets the customer know that you are actively working their issue at this very moment and a time estimate on how long it will take to complete your assessment/investigation and/or deliver a solution. Valuable details for this type of communication are:
	<ul>
		<li>Time estimate of when the customer should expect the next communication from you/MSFT in which more/additional details will be shared.</li>
		<li>If you are working with another internal team on the solution, share that information and that you are waiting on their input (please see TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2927087/azure-support---team-engagement">2927087</a> for how to reference internal MSFT teams).</li>
		<li>Although you aren&rsquo;t giving them a solution or asking them for further information, you are giving them a quality response that action is being taken presently. If you are not actively working on their case, you should not use this as a workaround to meet SLA.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The following does not qualify as an FQR communication:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Sending a response to meet SLA when you are not actively working the case in that moment.</li>
	<li>Sending a templated response.</li>
	<li>Sending an update email that contains only information the customer already has (no additional information).</li>
</ul>

<p><span><sup><span><span><span>1</span></span></span></sup><span><span><span> Follow-up communications every 24 hours, during the work week only.<br>
<sup>2</sup><strong> </strong>Customer may request 24/7 support; customer must be available to troubleshoot as needed. Communications frequency may change at the request of the customer.<br>
<sup>3</sup> Refer to TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2786284"><span>2786284</span></a> for more information on Microsoft Unified Support.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>You may also review the customer-facing information about support scope and response time on the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/plans/response/">Azure webpage</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Contact Policy</strong></h3>

<p>You can contact customers by phone if you feel it is the best way to address their issue, even if they have selected &ldquo;email&rdquo; as their contact preference. <span>Call the customer only during business hours&nbsp;(9 AM to 5 PM in the customer&#39;s time zone), unless the case requires 24/7 support.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>24/7 Support: </span></strong><span>If the customer has selected 24/7 support when submitting their case, you may call the customer outside business hours if you feel it could resolve the issue more quickly. </span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Use your best judgement before calling customers outside of business hours. Calling customers a couple hours before or after business hours is okay, just note that you may not receive a response. Also, as a courtesy, you can email the customer to ask for permission to call if it is late or early hours for the customer (i.e., 12 AM or 6 AM customer time).</span></p>

<p><strong>Severity A (Sev A) issues:</strong> These cases require calling the customer, regardless of whether the customer has requested to be contacted by email. (It&#39;s part of their agreement when creating a Sev A issue.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you fail to meet IR for a premier case, please notify your manager. You can also refer to TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2636922/azure-support---case-management-and-wellness">2636922</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If your customer doesn&#39;t answer the phone in the above scenario: </strong>If you call the customer and get no response, you should change the severity to a Sev B, because the customer is being unresponsive.</p>

<p>A few rules apply when downgrading a customer&rsquo;s request:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You cannot downgrade a customer&rsquo;s issue without their permission unless they are non-responsive. If the customer contact preference is email and they don&#39;t reply within one hour, you can downgrade the case. If their preference is phone, call them. If they don&#39;t answer, you should email them and then wait one hour.</li>
	<li>Microsoft Unified Support, Premier, and Pro Direct customers cannot be downgraded without their permission. Refer to TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2786284/AzureSupportPremierandProDirectEngagement">2786284</a> if you need to do so.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Downgrading Sev A: </strong>These cases require you to call the customer to inform the customer of the change in severity. See TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2636922/azure-support---case-management-and-wellness">2636922</a>for more details.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before downgrading a customer&rsquo;s request, make sure the severity is aligned with the Azure Classification, Escalation, and Notification (CEN) matrix as noted in the <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2625416">CEN TSG</a>.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</strong></h3>

<h4><strong><a id="FQR Process Overview" name="FQR Process Overview"></a>FQR Process Overview</strong></h4>

<p>For all cases <strong>except for Sev A</strong> (see <a bookmark-id="Exception in FQR Process: Severity A Cases" data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/2777192#Exception in FQR Process: Severity A Cases" managed-link="" target="">Exception in FQR Process: Severity A Cases</a>), below is the high-level approach to the new FQR process:</p>

<p>If the ticket is a Sev A with <strong>less than 15 minutes before</strong> SLA expires or it is a Sev A where the <strong>SLA has already expired,</strong> then you should call the customer ASAP and live troubleshoot their problem. In all other instances follow the detailed process below:</p>

<ul>
	<li>(No changes to current process.)</li>
</ul>

<h5><strong><a id="Step 2: Initial Investigation" name="Step 2: Initial Investigation"></a>Step 2: Initial Investigation</strong></h5>

<ul>
	<li>Before sending the initial response, review the information provided by the customer in the ticket.</li>
	<li>Open up <a href="https://azuresupportcenter.msftcloudes.com/ticketdetails">Azure Support Center</a> to pull up subscription and resource details, as well as any other diagnostics tools that may be necessary for your investigation.</li>
	<li>Investigate the issue using ASMS TSGs and previous knowledge.</li>
	<li>Determine the solution and move on to <a bookmark-id="Step 3: Deliver Solution to Customer" data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/2777192#Step 3: Deliver Solution to Customer" managed-link="" target="">Step 3: Deliver Solution to Customer</a>.

</ul>

<h5><strong><a id="Step 3: Deliver Solution to Customer" name="Step 3: Deliver Solution to Customer"></a>Step 3: Deliver Solution to Customer</strong></h5>

<ul>
	<li>If preferred contact method is phone, call the customer. Use the initial investigation results to deliver the solution verbally and address follow-up questions your customer might have.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important: </strong>Use the below template <strong><em><u>only</u></em></strong> for guidance. It is important to use your best judgment to personalize the response and the solution to the customer. With the FQR approach you should make sure to avoid providing scripted-sounding responses and instead make sure to craft a personalized email. A simple copy and paste is not a customer-centric approach. Determine what works best for your customer. You can also leverge this <a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/teams/ASMS_Runtime_Operations/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BAD7C93B2-9EC2-4F74-843A-63DBB6BE3E15%7D&amp;file=Paraphrasing%20Guide%20for%20Quota.docx&amp;action=default&amp;mobileredirect=true&amp;DefaultItemOpen=1" managed-link="" target="_blank">paraphrasing guidline </a>document for assitance in formulating your email.</p>

<ul>
	<li>If you delivered the solution over the phone, change this introduction to reflect your conversation and provide a written summary of everything you did. If your customer agreed with the solution and case closure over the phone, phrase this email with what we are resolving, how we resolved it, and that you will be closing this incident.</li>
