<strong>Example:</strong> A corporate client requests Compliance documentation to provide to their auditing firm.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy </strong></h3>

<h4><strong><a id="SSAE16SOC1Type2/SOC2Type2" name="SSAE16SOC1Type2/SOC2Type2"></a>HIPAA and the HITECH Act</strong></h4>

<p>HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) and the HITECH (Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act) Act are United States laws that apply to healthcare entities with access to Protected Health Information (PHI). For a covered healthcare company to use a cloud service like Windows Azure, the service provider must agree in a written agreement to adhere to specific security and privacy provisions outlined in HIPAA and the HITECH Act.</p>

<p>To help customers comply with HIPAA and the HITECH Act, Microsoft offers Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) as a contract addendum. Customers should contact their Microsoft account manager to sign the agreement.</p>

<p>Before signing the BAA, customers should read the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/offering-hipaa-hitech?view=o365-worldwide" managed-link="" target="_blank">Windows Azure HIPAA guide</a>, as this document can assist customers who are interested in HIPAA and the HITECH Act to understand the relevant capabilities of Windows Azure.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="SSAE16SOC1Type2/SOC2Type2" name="SSAE16SOC1Type2/SOC2Type2"></a>SSAE 16 SOC 1 Type 2/SOC 2 Type 2</strong></h4>

<p>The SSAE 16 SOC 1 Type 2/SOC 2 Type 2 report is now available to Global Admins via self-service but cannot be redistributed, e.g., an ISV partner cannot request the report and then forward the report to their customer. We are required by the auditor to track who gets the reports, so please have these customers create a trial tenant and download the report themselves. General SOC Report information is available at <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance/soc" managed-link="" target="_blank">Trust Center - Compliance</a>.</p>

<p>To obtain the SOC reports, the Global Admin will need to log into the at <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://trustportal.office.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Service Trust Portal</a> (STP). &nbsp;An additional NDA is no longer required. However, only the Global Admin of the tenant can obtain this report. If required, follow the process to set up a tenant and become the Global Admin at <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/get-started-with-the-microsoft-service-trust-portal" managed-link="" target="_blank">Get started with Microsoft Service Trust Portal</a>.</p>

<p>These reports are found in the Service Trust Portal for O365 and are self-serve only, and Support cannot obtain these reports for the customer.

<h3><strong><a id="AzureOperations/Security/Compliance" name="AzureOperations/Security/Compliance"></a>Azure Operations/Security/Compliance </strong></h3>

<p>All compliance-related questions should be directly related to a certification or compliance Microsoft presently holds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If a customer has general questions, you can point them to the web pages around security and compliance. SEs don&rsquo;t answer general questions, always point back to one of the security and compliance certifications we presently hold. Refer customers with security-related questions on Azure to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/Documents/TrustDocuments?command=Download&amp;downloadType=Document&amp;downloadId=f7ca8423-1bc5-4be0-bff8-b6056f87c134&amp;docTab=6d000410-c9e9-11e7-9a91-892aae8839ad_FAQ_and_White_Papers" managed-link="" target="_blank">Standard Response to Request for Information Microsoft Azure Security, Privacy, and Compliance</a>.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="SecurityandComplianceForms" name="SecurityandComplianceForms"></a>Security and Compliance Forms</strong></h4>

<p>If a customer requests for an SE to fill out a security or compliance form, inform them that we do not fill out any forms for customers. If they are an EA customer with a TAM, point them back to that person for assistance. If the user is not EA with a TAM, then no one in Microsoft will fill out the forms, they need to review and ask specific questions around the existing security and compliance certifications.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="GDPRCompliance" name="GDPRCompliance"></a>GDPR Compliance </strong></h4>

<p>Customers enquiring about our Data Processing Agreement should review our Data Protection Terms starting on Page 7 in the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/online-services-terms" managed-link="" target="_blank">Online Services Terms</a> (OST). The OST includes the primary data processing terms but is incorporated into the standard commercial contract. Among other things, it provides customers with a contractual commitment regarding our GDPR obligations.</p>

<p>Direct customers to review the GDPR specific terms at the end of the contract in Attachment 4 starting on Page 42. These sections cover Microsoft&rsquo;s GDPR obligations as a data processor as well as sub-processor to another data processor. Requests for any modifications of our contract should be sent to the licensing specialist (or licensing executive) assigned to the account. Changes to our legal contract are uncommon; however, there is a process through LS/LE to accommodate changes.</p>

If the customer is not satisfied with the information provided in the above links and has a valid business justification for requesting a physical datacenter audit, do the following:</span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong> This engagement process remains the same for all datacenters if the customer is requesting a TVRA. Any customer who signs the Online Services Terms (<span>OST) and Online Service Data Protection Addendum (DPA) </span><span> </span><span> </span>with Microsoft is granted audit rights.</span></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Other datacenter-related reports, such as <span>Evidence/Artifacts</span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span> reports, provide customers with assurances that we are following our processes as designed. These reports can be shared with customers when a customer exercises their right to an audit as per OST/DPA. <span>These requests should also be submitted to FACET.</span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<h3><strong><a id="EngagementandEscalationPath" name="EngagementandEscalationPath"></a>Engagement and Escalation Path </strong></h3>

<p>Many general compliance questions can be answered by first directing the customer to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/TrustCenter/Compliance" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft STP - Compliance</a></p>

<p>The <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/ViewPage/FAQ" managed-link="" target="_blank">Service Trust Portal FAQ</a> is another great public-facing resource for many compliance questions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you run into compliance issues that you can&#39;t answer, engage your P/TAs who will then reach out to <a href="mailto:azuretrust@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure Trust Champs</a>; DL to obtain the required info, as that is the only proper escalation path for Compliance questions.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
This is not applicable for forced requests (SoT, Cancellations, etc.,) in which we do not have Account Owners approval. These which still required CELA&rsquo;s assistance and the escalation path for these remains the same which is SE &gt; TA &gt; Manager &gt; Director for individual cases.</p>

<p>For Government customers having issues downloading FedRamp information, have them email Azure Federal Documentation (<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:AzFedDoc@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">AzFedDoc@microsoft.com</a>) for assistance.</p>
