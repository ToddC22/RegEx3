<header><h1>ASMS – ASE Engagement</h1></header><p>Submit a <a href="http://sharepoint/sites/fastrack/Lists/ModTrack/NewForm.aspx?RootFolder=">ModTrack</a> request to update this TSG.</p>

<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This TSG provide guidance on how and when to engage the Azure Service Engineering (ASE) and Customer Experience Team (CXP) teams.</p>

<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<h4><strong>Which Team Should I Engage? (ASE vs. CXP)</strong></h4>

<p>Follow the guidance below to determine when to engage ASE vs CXP (formerly WASU), and when ASMS owns the scenario.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>All Severity 1 and Severity 2 issues on the below portals should go directly to the <a href="http://aka.ms/CRI-WASMS-WASU">CXP</a> team, regardless of their issue type. Note: TA approval is needed for CXP engagement.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Send all Severity 3 and Severity 4 issues, to ASE.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Always engage ASE first when you are asked to engage Azure <span>Commercial</span><em><span> </span></em>Experiences, Signup and Provisioning (ACE).</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Do not use the ASE template as a way to open IcM tickets to any other team. ASE is not the same as IcM.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>ASE maintains Pacific Standard Time (PST) and Asia Pacific (APAC) staffing hours, so Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) and weekends are ASE off-hours.</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p>ASE is not available after 6:00 PM PST Friday until the opening of Chinese business hours on Monday at 9:00 AM China Time (06:00 PM PST).</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>ASE follows the standard Severity 3 and Severity 4 Service Level Agreement (SLA). If you do not receive a timely response, engage your TA for further assistance.</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p>Your TA will escalate the issue with ASE.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Send Severity 3 Critical (production impacting) issues to CXP during ASE off-hours.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Sovereign China Azure (Mooncake) is not supported by ASE.</p>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>
		<p>If you receive a case with this offer, create a task or transfer the case to the <strong>GBS China 21V Commerce Support</strong> queue.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>For issues with <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/subscriptions">Visual Studio</a> API Logs or user management engage the VSTS Developer Team Queue: <strong>Developer VSTS</strong>, as ASE does not support these issues.</p>

<p>Additional guidance on performing network traces can be found in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2663762" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2663762</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<h4><strong>ASE Scope</strong></h4>

<p>The following scenarios are supported by ASE. Should you have any questions regarding these scenarios, engage your TA or PTA.</p>

<ul>
</ul>

<p><strong><a id="Error in Billing Blade" name="Error in Billing Blade"></a>Error in Billing Blade</strong><br>
If a customer has reported a portal issue, do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Confirm if the issue has occurred on any of the following portals:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>ms.portal.azure.com</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>account.azure.com</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>Global Azure</p>

		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Determine if the issue is on the Billing blade of the respective portal:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>To bring up the Billing blade, have the customer press <strong>CTRL</strong>+<strong>ALT</strong>+<strong>D </strong>while in the Azure portal and provide a screenshot.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If you confirm that the portal error has occurred in the Billing blade, then escalate to ASE.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>If the portal error did not occur in the Billing blade, follow the normal escalation path.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a id="Spike in Usage" name="Spike in Usage"></a>Spike in Usage</strong><br>
If you receive a case where the customer is inquiring about a spike in usage (i.e. storage consumption, compute, bandwidth) do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Work with the respective technical team to determine what resource caused the spike.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>If you are unsure which team is responsible for which resource, engage your TA/PTA.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p>If the issue is related to continuous charging of deleted disk, see <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2832915">TSG 2832915</a> to guide the customer in removing the snapshots. If the customer is still being charged after the snapshots have been removed, engage ASE.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>If the data found by the respective technical team is not aligned to the usage report, then engage ASE for further troubleshooting.</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>Be sure to include the data found by the technical team in your engagement with ASE.</p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a id="No Resource Found in Portal but Still Getting Billed" name="No Resource Found in Portal but Still Getting Billed"></a>No Resource Found in Portal but Still Getting Billed</strong><br>
If a resource cannot be located in the customer&rsquo;s portal, but they are still being billed due to the resource appearing in the usage report:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the reported customer issue is regarding Microsoft.Compute, Microsoft.Storage, and Microsoft.Network resources, escalate to ASE and provide the Resourced ID.</li>
	<li>If the reported customer issue is not regarding Microsoft.Compute, Microsoft.Storage, and Microsoft.Network resources, work with your TA/PTA to find the best engagement path.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><a id="ACE Team Engagement" name="ACE Team Engagement"></a>ACE Team Engagement</strong></h4>

<p>ACE&nbsp;should only be contacted through the ASE escalation path. ASE will engage&nbsp;ACE&nbsp;and get back to you with an appropriate response.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="ASMS Scope" name="ASMS Scope"></a>ASMS Scope</strong></h4>

<p>The following scenarios are supported by ASMS. Should you have any questions regarding these scenarios engage your TA or PTA.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Customer Unable to Access Subscriptions" name="Customer Unable to Access Subscriptions"></a>Customer Unable to Access Subscriptions</strong><br>
Customers may be able to access subscriptions from the <a href="https://account.windowsazure.com/">Accounts Portal</a>, but receive an error when trying to access their subscriptions from <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">Ibiza</a>.</p>

<p>In which the error message will say the following (or something similar):</p>

<p class="indent-1"><em><strong>Some subscriptions couldn&#39;t be retrieved. Consider checking your connection, your firewall settings or try again later.</strong></em></p>

<p>In these instances, there are two options to resolve the issues:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Inform the customer that their internal IT department will need to unblock the following URLS in their proxy:&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1">*.azure.com<br>
*.azureadvisor.msftcloudes.com<br>
*.azurecomcdn.net<br>
*.azureedge.net<br>
*.msecnd.net<br>
*.newrelic.com<br>
*.sendgrid.com<br>
*.windows.net</p>

<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> If the customer is unable to contact their IT department at that time, they can attempt this temporary solution: Suggest to the customer to bypass their internal proxy or attempt to access the portal from outside their network.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Incorrect Tenants" name="Incorrect Tenants"></a>Incorrect Tenants</strong><br>
Customers may receive error messages when trying to create new subscriptions due to an issue with tenant. Especially, when a guest user was temporarily allowed to create subscriptions but created them in the incorrect tenant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In these instances, customers may receive the following error message (or something similar):</p>

<p class="indent-1"><em><strong>We detected an issue creating subscriptions in your account. Please contact support [1178].</strong></em></p>

<p>To resolve this issue, suggest the customer to do the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a new tenant and change the subscription tenant from the current tenant to the new tenant.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Advise to not allow users to create new subscriptions via the account&rsquo;s portal, as it will fail, and we will ask them to contact support.</li>
		<li>Advise to create a new account and do a subscription ownership transfer (SOT) to a different account.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> When assisting a customer who cannot create a subscription because the subscription was incorrectly assigned to the tenant, verify that you have transferred all subscriptions from the old account to the new account before closing the case. If the user has an Azure in Open subscription, follow the guidelines in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/2989663">TSG 2989663</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a id="Hybrid Benefit Activation Inquiry" name="Hybrid Benefit Activation Inquiry"></a>Hybrid Benefit Activation Inquiry</strong><br>
If you need to find out when a Hybrid Benefit was activated on a VM, engage the VM team (Setup and Configuration). Use the following SAP to route the&nbsp;task:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>Azure/Virtual Machine running Windows/Configuration and Setup/My issue or question is specific to Hybrid Use Benefit (HUB) (public)</em></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a id="Azure Calculator Issue" name="Azure Calculator Issue"></a>Azure Calculator Issue</strong><br>
For issues related to Azure Calculators, email CalcHelp@microsoft.com.</p>

<p><strong><a id="MINT Accounts" name="MINT Accounts"></a>MINT Accounts</strong><br>
Most MINT accounts have been phased out. As part of this phase-out, customers who attempt to log into MINT&#8203;&#8203; accounts will receive the following <a href="https://account.azure.com/Error/400/1190">error message</a>:</p>

<p class="indent-1"><em><strong>There&#39;s a problem with your account. File a ticket with support to fix your account.</strong></em></p>

<p>Should you receive a customer who is still on MINT, check if the account if orphaned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the account is orphaned and is a MINT account, engage PayOps to convert the MINT account into an Operations Management Suite (OMS) account.</li>
	<li>If the account is orphaned but is not a MINT account, use the standard subscription ownership transfer process in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3040383">TSG 3040383</a> to resolve the orphaned account.</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<ol start="3">
	<li><span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Submit</strong> to create the IcM.</span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<h4>Attaching a 4MB+ file to a IcM</h4>

<p>For files that need to be attached but are larger than the allotted file size, do the following:</p>

<p>If needed, install 7-Zip (<a href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/itweb/Software/ThirdPartySoftware/Pages/Product.aspx?Pid=1463">7-Zip</a> - <strong>Internal only</strong>) and follow the steps below.</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Select the files to be attached.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Right-click the selected files.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scroll to <strong>7-Zip</strong> and click <strong>Add to archive.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Enter a name for the file in the <strong>Archive</strong> field, set the <strong><em>Archive format</em></strong> to <strong>zip</strong>, and in the <strong><em>Split to volumes, bytes</em></strong> field, enter <strong>4000000</strong> and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>After the compression completes, highlight the required files.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>From the <strong>Attachments</strong> tab of the IcM, click <strong>Add Files</strong> then click <strong>Open</strong> in the dialog box.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>All files will be attached in sequence to the IcM.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Responding/Reactivating IcM</h4>

<p>After engaging ASE, the team may update the ticket and request&nbsp;additional information to complete the investigation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In these cases, the following happens:</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>ASE changes the status to <strong>Mitigated</strong>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>ASE&nbsp;changes the Owner of the ticket to reflect the ASMS originator.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>IcM sends an email notification to both the ASMS SE and the ASE Engineer that worked on the IcM, alerting that the IcM has been reassigned back to the ASMS SE.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li>After the case has been assigned back to the SE, the following must occur: &nbsp;
		<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
			<li>Gather the information ASE requested.</li>
			<li>Update the IcM details with the information provided.</li>
			<li>Reactivate the IcM by doing the following:&nbsp;
			<ul>
				<li>
				<p><span><span><span><span><span>Change the Status of the ticket to <strong>Active</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
				</li>
				<li>
				<p><span><span><span><span><span>Change the Owner&nbsp;to the <em>ASE Engineer</em> who last worked on the case.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-3"><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span><span>This step will&nbsp;</span><span>trigger an email from IcM to the respective Team/ASE Engineer to alert them that updates have been made.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<ol start="4">
	<li>
	<p>By completing the steps above to reactivate the IcM,&nbsp;you are alerting ASE that they can continue their investigation.</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<h4>Opening a New IcM for Same Customer Issue</h4>

<p>When opening a new IcM with the <em>same issue</em> as a previous IcM, <strong>link</strong> the two IcM tickets together.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Verify the <em>Owning Service</em> and <em>Owning Team</em> are set to <strong>Support/ASE Triage</strong>.</p>

<p>To link one IcM ticket to another, follow these steps in the <strong>new </strong>IcM&nbsp;you have created:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Click the <strong>Links</strong> tab of the IcM ticket.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click the <strong>New Link</strong> button.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Change the <strong>Link Type</strong> drop-down box to <strong><em>Link Incident(s) to the below ID</em></strong><strong>.</strong></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>In the <strong>ID</strong> field, enter the number of the previous IcM ticket that was involved in the customer&#39;s issue.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Click <strong>Submit.</strong></p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>If there are multiple IcM to be linked, repeat the steps above for each IcM.</p>
