<span><span>The following policies are provided for advisory purposes only. At its sole discretion and at any time, Microsoft reserves the right to define and amend what is considered adult content, amend the published adult policy, restrict the presence of adult content across the network, and disable the use of adult keywords.</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Keywords that are associated with adult advertising content must be solely &quot;adult&quot; keywords; that is, a search user would enter the keyword into the search box only to view links to sexually explicit content. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Advertisers may not use keywords that are non-adult or ambiguous; that is, words that may be relevant to both an adult search results category and a non-adult search results category are not allowed. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Ads for sites that contain sexually explicit content must contain language that clearly indicates that the site contains sexually explicit content. Space permitting, ads must indicate that the landing page is for ages 18+ or for adults only. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Sites that do not feature sexually explicit content on the landing page or as a dominant theme on the website, but that link to adult content, must employ a &quot;bridge page&quot; warning users that adult content will be found when the link is clicked.<br>
	<br>
	<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> The bridge page should not contain explicit adult graphics.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Sites that feature adult images must include an age disclaimer on their site and all models must have the appearance of being 18 years or older.</span></span></span></span><br>
	&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Examples of acceptable age disclaimers include but are not limited to 18 U.S.C. section 2257 Compliance Notice and 18 U.S.C. 2257 record Keeping Requirements Compliance Statement for the U.S. This disclaimer must indicate that all models are 18 years or older and link to the Custodian of Records page.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Sites with only animated/cartoon pornography are not required to have the Disclaimer/Custodian of Records. Sites with both animation and non-animation pornography must contain the required model disclaimer.</span></span></span></span><br>

<strong><span><span><span>Notes:</span></span></span></strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>Adult - Mature: For non-Adult approved advertisers, use as a confirm flag only when the content described is over the edge, shows explicit sexual images, or promotes additional explicit adult products. Otherwise these products are fine and no flag would be added. For Adult advertisers, use as a confirm flag only when the content described is borderline adult content/mature (e.g., affairs dating, breast and penis enlargement, sexual health, etc.).</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Adult - Approved: For content allowed in the Adult Marketplace. This flag would be confirmed for any non-Adult advertisers that are advertising this content and would reject the content. Confirming the flag for an Adult approved advertiser would allow the content to serve.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Adult - Disallowed Content: Confirming the flag for anyone will reject the content. This is contents we wouldn&#39;t allow any advertisers to serve.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Do safe search settings impact ads serving? No, Adult Mature ads always serve in markets where they are allowed, but Adult Approved ads are affected by safe search settings. AdultBitMask is set for approved Adult Mature ads for use by publishers for filtration like Native ads, AdsInApps, etc.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Which markets allow/disallow adult mature ads by default?<br>
	<strong><u>Allowed:</u></strong> AU, BR, CA, DE, FR, GB, IE, NZ, TW, US<br>
	<strong><u>Disallowed:</u></strong> AE, AR, AT, BH, CH, CL, CN, CO, DK, DZ, EG, ES, FI, HK, ID, IN, IQ, IT, JO, KW, LB, LY, MA, MX, MY, NL, NO, OM, PE, PH, QA, SA, SE, SG, TH, TN, VE, VN, YE</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Are there any serving restrictions in the US on Adult Mature ads? No.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span></span></span><span><span><span>Do advertisers have to target the markets in which Adult Mature is not allowed for the flag to apply? Policy enforcement is based on OPC mapping (adgroup language to country mapping).</span></span></span></li>

<p><a id="Q1" name="Q1"></a><br>
<span><strong><span><span>Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What type of adult-themed content - categorized as &quot;mature&quot; - is allowed for advertisers who are not participating in the Adult Advertising Program?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>The following is allowed:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Erotic novels and literature and erotic or vintage photographs as art (not as porn). </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Underwear/clothing websites showing models posing in underwear for the purpose of selling those products, where there are no images that reveal bare breasts, genitals, buttocks or butt cracks. Tasteful and non-sexual images of see-through underwear of buttocks or butt cracks are considered as mature. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>In the context of an otherwise tasteful site (e.g.: Victoria&rsquo;s Secret), sheer, mesh and fishnet items showing nipples (if this is the exception across the site&rsquo;s content). </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Some nudity/adult content on adult product sites (e.g. X-rated DVDs or sexy logos), provided such content is not featured on the landing page. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Photographs or images of breasts, male or female genitalia used in medical context or to depict medical conditions. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Breast enhancement / penis enlargement Web sites offering pills, surgery, weights, creams, implants, and extension/stretch devices presented as medical, informational, or for educational purposes without sexually-explicit articles or images, and do not offer sexually-related products, such as sex toys.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Breast enlargement sites may be approved for keywords such as &quot;huge tits&quot; but must use <strong><span>non</span></strong>-adult synonyms in their ad (ex: huge breasts). Penis enlargement sites may be approved for keywords such as &quot;big cock&quot; but must use <strong><span>non</span></strong>-adult synonyms in their ad (ex: big penis).</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q2" name="Q2"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Regarding the denigrating and obscene policies, what constitutes extreme and shocking vs. mild S&amp;M?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>This is a gray area. There is a fine line between obscenity and mild fetish in some areas, particularly in the areas of humiliation, severe infliction of pain and non-consensual sex. Disapprove ads in the following scenarios:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If there is blood, feces, or urine. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the content appears to be, or is marketed as, torture. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the person clearly appears to be in actual physical pain or there are overly realistic depictions of pain. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Clearly non-consensual/overly realistic depictions of non-consensual sex. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Use of equipment that prevents or restricts the person from withdrawing consent (ball gags, etc.). </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If you are in doubt and such content is the main prominent theme of a website and could be considered extreme or shocking, please escalate to L3.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q3" name="Q3"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Why do we want to have bridge pages on non-adult sites that link to adult sites if we don&rsquo;t insist on this for sites that are sexually explicit?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>When a site is reviewed for adult content editors will select the appropriate adult flag:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the advertiser is not enabled for Adult, the system rejects content accordingly. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If an advertiser is enabled for Adult, that ad will run, but it will be subject to several measures to avoid that content being exposed to users who have not requested such content. For example, safe search filters, match type restrictions, and keyword restrictions. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>In the event that a site is principally non-adult content, it will be approved, and an adult bridge page gives users warning that the content they will link to may be sexually explicit in nature. With this in place, the advertiser does not need to be rejected or restricted and can operate in the normal marketplace with a non-adult rating. Please note that bridge pages are not required when a non-adult page links to sex toy content with no nudity or sexually explicit content on the page.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Failure to implement a bridge page may mean downstream that publishers requesting clean ads could have users link to adult content unintentionally and without warning. For example:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>A normal DVD site with an XXX category. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>A non-adult chat site with links to a sister site which has explicit content.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q4" name="Q4"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>How do I know whether a site is participating in the Adult Advertising Program?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Editors should classify the content seen with the appropriate flags based on the definitions regardless of advertiser status. The system downstream will cross-reference to Adult status and create the correct outcome for that advertiser. An advertiser&#39;s status as Adult is visible in EVD jobs and in the Microsoft Advertising UI.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q5" name="Q5"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>The definition of sexually explicit content is based on how graphic the landing page content is. Why are sex toy sites rated as Adult Content?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Sex toys are considered an adult product. If we did not rate these sites as adult, then a publisher requesting clean ads would receive sex toy ads in the ad call. Please classify all related content under the correct flag: <strong><span>Adult &ndash; Products / Toys</span></strong><strong><span><span>.</span></span></strong></span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<br>
<a id="Q6" name="Q6"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What extreme/shocking products are allowed to be sold on sex toy sites?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>While their use in porn is restricted by our policy, the sale of electro-shock/electric stimulation products, gynecological sex toys, and floggers/whips are allowed within the adult marketplace. In addition, keywords for the sale of acceptable products modified with the word &quot;extreme&quot; are allowed. Please note the following restrictions:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>&quot;Whip&quot; terms must include an acceptable adult modifier (ex: &lsquo;whip sex toy&rsquo;). </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Images for the sale of these sex toy products in use cannot be prevalent and must be modeled purely for product sales. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Advertising for web sites with content that displays images, video, etc., where the use of the above referenced equipment as the dominant theme will continue to be disallowed.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q7" name="Q7"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>The .xxx domain is marketed by some advertisers such as GoDaddy and others. Is this considered adult content?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>That depends on what is on the site. We don&#39;t consider the sale of domains to be adult in nature. If the site contains adult material such as nudity, the advertiser would need to be adult enabled to promote this content. Non-adult advertisers that are promoting .xxx sites may be restricted in what terms they can bid on, as we will not allow non-adult advertisers to bid on unambiguously adult terms.</span></span></span></p>

Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What is meant by &quot;Ads must contain language that clearly indicates that the site contains sexually explicit content&quot;?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong> <span><span><span>It is important that the ads do not lead users to believe a the site is non-adult. This is to ensure that users have clear expectations around the content they are likely to see. The disallowed example below would not be acceptable because the user may think this site is non-adult, and there is no clear indicator that adult content is on the site. </span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The graphic guidelines disallowing graphic adult content in the ad have been removed with the policy reconciliation exercise.</span></span></span></p>

Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What flag should be used when reviewing Sex Chat and Cam submissions?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>When processing Sex Chat and Cam, please use Flag 141 &ndash; Sex Chat and Cams. Previously, this flag was not used in North America because the external messaging was incorrect, but that has been corrected. This flag will be used for web cam and chat sites with the intent for sexual activity, including phone chat, sexting and sexlines.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q10" name="Q10"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What are the disclaimer requirements for adult Web sites?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>All models that appear on an adult site must have the appearance of being 18 or older. In addition,adult sites that contain images must include an accurate and truthful age disclaimer on their site&rsquo;s <em>front</em> page that states all models are at least 18 years old, regardless of the site&rsquo;s category. This disclaimer must link to their 18 U.S.C. 2257 custodian of records page.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Acceptable Disclaimer Examples:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>18 USC 2257 </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>2257 </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>2257A </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>USC 2257 </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>18 USC Compliant </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Title 18 </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Title 18 Info </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>All models are 18 years or older </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>All models were at least 18 years or older at time of photo </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Age Disclaimer</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> A site that only states &quot;Disclaimer,&quot; &quot;All visitors to this site must be 18 years or older,&quot; or &quot;Click here for more info on models&quot; is <strong>not</strong> acceptable.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q11" name="Q11"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>How should we handle mature content in more conservative markets like India and Singapore?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>These markets are more strict on nudity. Nudity is not acceptable in these markets even if the products are otherwise acceptable. For example, nudity in the context of a medical site would not be allowed in India or Singapore. Lingerie sites may not show see-through products that expose nipples, and butt-cracks and the majority of the breast should be covered in all images.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q12" name="Q12"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What types of &quot;Erotica&quot; keywords are allowed in the Adult Keyword List?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Terms modified by the word &quot;erotica&quot; are acceptable when they are clearly in reference to acceptable Adult products and toys. Other terms modified with &quot;erotica&quot; are generally considered &#39;mature&#39; but not pornographic. The word &quot;erotica&quot; is still considered Ambiguous.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Acceptable terms must be &quot;adult&quot; keywords for which a customer would perform a Bing search to view sites that offer adult products/sex toys. For example, terms such as &quot;erotica stores,&quot; &quot;erotica furniture,&quot; and &quot;erotica devices&quot; are obviously referencing sexual products and can be treated as Adult. However, terms such as &quot;erotica books&quot; and &quot;erotica lingerie&quot; will remain non-adult/ambiguous. As before, adult keywords that already contain language that is graphic or explicit in nature (ex: &quot;erotica cock rings,&quot; &quot;bdsm erotica DVD&quot;) will continue to be approved. Keywords that relate in any way to illegal/disallowed content will continue to be declined.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q13" name="Q13"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Are products that improve Oral Sex allowed in the Adult Advertising Program?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Tongue strips, mints and spray products that are marketed to improve the Oral Sex experience are considered acceptable adult products under Flag 104 &ndash; Adult Products/Toys. These products will typically make the tongue tingle for added enjoyment, offer various flavors to mask the taste of semen, or will contain numbing agents that will help to remove the gag reflex and/or allow the male to last longer.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q14" name="Q14"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Why are sexual orientation related contents monitored in some markets?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Please refer to the FAQ in&nbsp;<span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2758598" target="_blank">Policy: Disallowed and Restricted Content (2758598)</a>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Q: (Updated) Where is the Adult Advertiser Resources page?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The Adult Advertiser Resources page should <strong>only be shared with advertisers approved in the Adult Advertising program</strong>. The pages for each market were republished to the following locations as hidden pages and without the requirement for passcodes. The original URL for the Adult Advertiser Resources page in each market will no longer work.</span></span></span></p>
