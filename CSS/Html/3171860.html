<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a><span>1. Overview</span></h3>

<div class="kb-generic-section section">
<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Account linking</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>An account link is a powerful thing. When a customer&rsquo;s account is linked, it provides access and control over that Microsoft Advertising account, including:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Running campaigns.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Ability to take over billing and payment responsibilities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Granting and removing access to other customers requesting to link to the account.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Other account management activities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Conversely, if access is given to the account, that person has full control to manage the account and the customer&rsquo;s advertising. This includes the ability to take over billing.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Customers can opt to take over billing when they link to an account or at any time after they have linked to that account. When agencies take over billing, they assume responsibility for all advertising charges, including any charges that are pending when the link is established. Therefore, it&#39;s best for customers to have an agreement in place with the current bill-to customer (which may be the account owner or another third party) before proceeding with this optional step.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a>1.2 Notes</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>For technical assistance with account linking and agency management issues, complete the Escalation Template. <strong>Issue Category = Global Support Escalations &gt; Issue Type = Campaign Setup Technical Issue</strong>, and submit the request to <strong>T2 Sub-Team = Billing &amp; commerce platform technical issue</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Customers need the role of Super Admin assigned to their login to have the correct permissions to send a request to link to/manage a customer&rsquo;s account, accept the link request to allow another customer to manage their account (since managing customers can accept invitations on behalf of owning customers of the account), unlink a customer from managing another customer&rsquo;s account, and request to take over billing after linking.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Internal users can create a new CID on the customers behalf by using the UCM-A Tool &quot;Create a new CID&quot;. UCM help content contains detailed process steps (not yet available for Brazil market).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>All customers have access to link to another customer&rsquo;s account by default. There is no longer an agency setting that needs to be defined first.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>All customers including the client/owning account customer can now perform the unlink operation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The account a customer wishes to link to/manage should be created from within the owning account customer shell, not the agency&rsquo;s/managing customer shell. This provides greater flexibility and control to the owning account customer if the relationship between the two parties ceases.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Up to five customers can be linked to the same account at the same time.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the agency/managing customer is selected as the bill-to party (who pays the bills) on the account, the threshold and cycle date on the owning advertiser&rsquo;s account will align with the agency&rsquo;s/managing customer&rsquo;s cycle date and threshold trust level.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>When the accounts are unlinked, the cycle date and threshold on the owning advertiser&rsquo;s account will revert to the owning advertiser&rsquo;s cycle date and threshold level.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the bill-to on the account is selected as the agency during linking, the threshold and cycle date on the direct advertiser&rsquo;s account will align with the agency&rsquo;s cycle date and threshold trust level. When the accounts are unlinked, the cycle date and threshold on the direct advertiser&rsquo;s account will revert to the direct advertiser&rsquo;s cycle date and threshold level.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>On Behalf Of (OBO) Billing: A feature related to account access entitles users to view the account billing documents. The OBO Billing feature allows users with access to a specific account to view billing documents, no matter their user role. There are some edge cases where a user may not have access to those documents, despite their account access:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>For consolidated invoices:</span></span></strong> </span></p>

<p class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span>The account&#39;s billing documents are part of a consolidated invoice. If they are part of a consolidated invoice, the user must have access to all the accounts which are part of the consolidated invoice to view the invoice in the billing grid. </span></span></span> </span></p>

<p class="paragraph"><span><strong><span><span><span>For agencies: </span></span></span></strong> </span></p>

<p class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span>Non-bill-to agencies will not have access to the billing documents if the bill-to party is another agency. The same logic applies for access to invoices. </span></span></span> </span></p>

<p class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span>Scenario: </span></span></span> </span></p>

<p class="paragraph"><span><span><span><span>Agency A (bill-to): Has access to billing documents </span></span></span> <span><span><br>
<span>Parent customer P: Has access to billing documents</span><br>
<span>Agency B (non-bill-to): Does not have access to billing documents </span> </span></span></span></p>

		<li><span><span><span><span>Li</span></span></span><span><span><span>nking occurs instantly (after approval) and most links will occur without downtime! Downtime only occurs when there is a delay in user acceptance of an IO.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>If an&nbsp;internal user creates an Insertion Order during the linking workflow, the agency still needs to approve the Insertion Order (IO) before the account can go live. After the link is accepted, the agency will see the IO in the Insertion Orders tab. From there they can approve or edit it as needed. Remember, the account will be dark from the time the account linking&nbsp;is accepted until the IO is accepted. To minimize the downtime, make sure the agency is ready to approve the IO as soon as the link is accepted. Alternatively, the agency can send the link request themselves; if they do so, the Insertion Order will be automatically approved.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span>When does a scheduled link request take place?</span></span></span>&nbsp;<span><span><span>If the request is accepted before the scheduled date arrives, the link will be established at midnight on the day of the link request. The time zone used to determine midnight is the account&rsquo;s time zone. </span></span></span></li>

<h3><a id="4" name="4"></a>4.&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>Optimizing agencies - best practices</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><strong>Purpose:&nbsp;</strong>Outline best practices for optimizing agency accounts. The intent is to provide efficient tools and methods to do so. Often, agencies want us to recommend optimizations for specific customers or all their customers,&nbsp;and these practices will allow us to do this efficiently.</p>

<p><span><a aria-live="assertive" bookmark-id="top" data-bi-name="content-anchor-link" href="https://support.microsoft.com/api/preview#top" managed-link="" tabindex="0">Return to top</a></span></p>

<h4><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 Determining which agencies, customers, and accounts are managed within an agency</h4>

<ul>
	<li>As always, before offering optimizations to all the XIDs, we need to ensure that the agency and/or the specific XID we are making recommendations for is not managed.</li>
	<li>When&nbsp;you go into UCM, be sure that there are no Account Managers (AM) or Account Executives listed in the &ldquo;Account Team&rdquo; before outreach to offer optimizations.</li>
	<li>If an AM is managing an agency, they own all the customers linked to that agency, and that will appear in UCM.
	<ul>
		<li>There are some cases where an agency could manage a CID that has some XIDs associated that managed by different agencies or no agency. Because of this, you should always check the XID to see if there is an associated agency ID to ensure there is not an AM assigned to the larger agency or CID before recommending bulk optimizations for other XIDs.</li>
		<li>Agencies&nbsp;that do not have an AM should not have CID&rsquo;s that are managed by an AM that are linked to them. As a best practice, you should check the XIDs you are making recommendations for to ensure you are only making recommendations for unmanaged XIDs.</li>
		<li>Example of identifying managed accounts:
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Agency&nbsp;CID </strong>(Showing managed)<br>
			<span asset="4015864" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4015864]</span></li>
			<li><strong>Customer ID</strong> linked to that agency (Showing managed)<br>
			<span>&nbsp;</span><span asset="4015865" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4015865]</span></li>

<h4><span class="rangySelectionBoundary"><a id="4.2" name="4.2"></a>﻿</span><span><span><span><span>4.2 Optimizing agencies in bulk via UCM agency scorecard</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>The UCM agency/customer scorecard report allows you to quickly obtain customer ready excel reports you can use to engage your customers and agencies. Scorecard reports include:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Breakdowns of KPI&rsquo;s by account for a selected date range.</li>
	<li>Customer/Agency level of &lsquo;summary&rsquo; metrics.</li>
	<li>Feature Adoption &amp; Share of Voice metrics like Impression Share.</li>
	<li>Unique calculated metrics summarized and broken down by account like.
	<ul>
		<li>% share of spend</li>
		<li>% of ads below mainline</li>
		<li>% of spend on mobile</li>
		<li>% of spend by Match Type</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Step by step usage of the agency scorecard (UCM)</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>For an agency who is set up with an agency shell, you can utilize the agency scorecard report.</li>
	<li>Search for and select the agency CID.</li>
	<li>Once you&rsquo;re in the agency view, you will be able to see all the aligned accounts.</li>
	<li>Be sure to select the timeframe you want to run the report for:<br>
	<span asset="4551410" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4551410]</span></li>
	<li>
	<p><span><span><span>Select all the accounts/XIDs you would like to include in the report by checking the boxes on the left-hand side.</span></span></span></p>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Under <strong>Run Reports</strong>, select the dropdown arrow.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Scorecard Report</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>This will queue up the report in your job queue, which is found in the navigation bar on the left.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>This report will have a job name that begins with Scorecard and then the agency or customer name.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You can go into the job queue and view the status of the report at any time. Processing time for this depends on how many XIDs you select but should take around two to five minutes.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Once the job is complete, you will see the status as <strong>Success</strong> and be able to select the link to download the report.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You will then get an Excel report. Select <strong>Enable editing</strong> and <strong>Enable Content</strong> to view the report.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The report will contain two key tabs of information, <strong>Primary Measures</strong> and <strong>Secondary Measures</strong>. The rest of the tabs you can delete.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The Primary Measures tab gives you a high-level overview of the active and inactive accounts, and key performance metrics.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li>The Secondary Measures tab gives you more detailed spend and adoption information to help you offer optimizations.
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span>The example below shows the adoption metrics for Sitelinks and Match Types. As you can see, the account Watch Gnome only has 50% Sitelinks adoption and is using almost all exact. This is a good example of being able to run this report and quickly see the opportunity to offer Sitelinks and Match Type Expansions (Broad/Phrase).<br>

	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>How do I use this feature when an agency is not set up as an agency shell in Microsoft Advertising?</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If an agency is not set up as an agency shell in Microsoft Advertising, but is set up as a regular CID with XID&rsquo;s being each of the accounts they manage, you can still run the scorecard report for that customer ID. Go into the customer ID, select the accounts you would like to run the report for, select <strong>Run Reports</strong> and select <strong>scorecard report</strong>. This will queue up the report the same way it did for an agency shell.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>If </strong><strong>a customer indicates any of the below, confirm or ask, &quot;<em>Is your business an agency managing Microsoft Advertising accounts for advertisers</em>?&quot;</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>States that they are with an agency.</li>
	<li>Asks to set up multiple accounts with invoice billing.</li>
	<li>Asks about agency benefits or resources to help manage multiple advertisers.</li>
	<li>Has or requests to have client-agency relationship linked accounts.</li>
	<li>Has a Microsoft Advertising shell with multiple accounts or campaigns that have different business models or URLs.</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If on the Accounts tab, the customer&#39;s shell does not show &quot;become an agency&quot; link, then the customer shell is already setup as an agency.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Primary contact has an agency email address.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>If the customer is an agency, we should help them get set up as an agency shell in Microsoft Advertising:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>See&nbsp;<span><a bookmark-id="2.3" href="#2.3" managed-link="">section 2.3</a> </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span><span><span><span>and follow the outlined steps.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li>Setting up an agency correctly ensures that the agency gets the right permissions, marketing information, and benefits.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Best practices when optimizing agencies:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li>Create a separate ASD ticket for each XID you are optimizing.</li>
	<li>Always offer optimizations for all or multiple active XIDs.
	<ul>
		<li>Find out if there are particular XIDs the agency wants help with.</li>
		<li>If&nbsp;there are paused accounts, ask if there are reasons for the paused accounts.</li>
		<li>Use the scorecard to identify accounts with opportunity.</li>
	</ul>

<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="5" name="5"></a>5.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Customer hierarchies </span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Beginning February 2020, the new Manager Dashboard allows large advertiser and agencies to build customer to customer linking relationships, forming a hierarchical structure that makes the most sense to them. This allows:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Agencies and multi-account direct advertisers to map their business portfolios.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Empower agencies to get things done on behalf of their clients.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Enable centralized management to empower resource sharing (including UET tags via Shared Libraries) and horizontal reporting.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Hierarchies will not impact the multi-user experience:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If a user is using multi-user today, they can still switch between different customer shells by using the right-side multi-user drop down list.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>When users select a specific customer from the multi-user dropdown, then the left side account selector drop down list will refresh to show all children (additional customer shells, account numbers) under the specific customer shell.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Hierarchy and Sharing UET tag are enabled on the customer level. The Sharing Remarketing list is enabled on the customer and account level.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Terminology changes in UI:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>With this feature, brand term updates made within the UI were made. Nothing is changing with advocate/ticket/escalation requirements and sometimes terms will be used interchangeably between platform/tool/product/document. Key changes include:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Rebrand customer shell (CID) to manager account ID.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Rebrand account number (XID) to ad account.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Introduce Direct Manager - describes the CID which is linked to the manager account or the ad account.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><a id="FAQ" name="FAQ"></a>6. FAQ</h3>

<p><strong>Q: Does linking an agency take away my ability to manage my account?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> No, if you are the owner of the account, you will still be able to gain access using your credentials. You are simply inviting another customer to have access to your account via the &ldquo;link to account&rdquo; workflow.</p>

<p><strong>Q: I have various clients who want me to manage their accounts. Do I need a separate account for each client, or can they be managed under one username?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>You can now access other customers and the accounts they own through your own username. By adding multi-user access to your existing username, you effectively extend your reach by being able to access other people&#39;s accounts. The nice part is you don&#39;t need to remember another set of usernames and passwords, and you don&#39;t need to log in and out of Microsoft Advertising to view different accounts owned by other people. If you currently manage multiple usernames to access Microsoft Advertising accounts, you&#39;ll need to contact your account manager or <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=398371" target="_blank">contact support</a> to consolidate access. <span><span lang="EN"><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN"><span><span><span><span lang="EN"><span><span>Otherwise, you can gain multi-user access by accepting user invitations from others or by using your current username to create new and separate Microsoft Advertising accounts. You may find that setup useful if you&#39;re an agency that wants to keep separate accounts per client, but you also want to give individual clients their own usernames to access Microsoft Advertising for visibility and transparency. </span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><a href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56867/3" target="_blank"><span><span><span>https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56867/3</span></span></span></a></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Q: When I attempt to use the &rdquo;Link to Account&rdquo; option, I get the error message &quot;The customer number provided is invalid. Check the number and try again.&quot;</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:</strong> The customer number is different from the account number. The account number will cause an error if inserted into the Customer Number field. The customer number is available in the Accounts &amp; Billing section in your account. Select Accounts &amp; Billing, then select the sub-tab, Company information. The Customer Number will begin with a &quot;C.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Q: I have a number of clients that would like to try Microsoft Advertising, but the five-account limit per credit card prohibits me from doing so.</strong><br>
***Support advocates should proactively review whether the advertiser meets the criteria for a service level upgrade per the Account Shell Process ***.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A: </strong>I apologize for the inconvenience, but there is currently a five-account limit per credit card. However, I can have a specialist review your account to see if there are any workarounds.</p>

<p><strong>Q: When I attempt to &ldquo;Link to Account&rdquo;, I see a message inline that says &ldquo;If you want to take over billing, you will need to contact support.&rdquo; Why is that?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span><span>This is the message a customer will see when they have no payment instrument (PI) setup in their wallet other than a sold-to&nbsp;SAP ID. In this case, customers can link to an account, but cannot take over as the bill-to party since they have no qualifying PI setup yet in their wallet. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How can I take over billing after linking to an account?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I want to unlink a customer, but the &ldquo;unlink&rdquo; hyperlink is disabled &ndash; why is that?</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong>This should only happen when the managing customer is defined internally as a Channel Partner.&nbsp;Engineering and the business have decided to not allow external users to unlink from Channel Partner linked relationships like this unless the user making the request was built within the Channel Partner&rsquo;s customer shell.&nbsp;All other external users will be prevented from performing this unlink action.</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Escalation process: Support advocates will have permissions to unlink in this scenario, but they should not do this. Support advocates should escalate to Global Support, so they can confirm with engineering if this unlink request should be executed or not.</span></span></span></span><em><span lang="EN"></span></em></span></p>
