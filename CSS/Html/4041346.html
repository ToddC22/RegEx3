Overview</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>All returned devices go through an inspection process at the SVC to determine how an order is processed. Physical damage to a device is not covered by the standard warranty. If there is any damage to the device, the SVC technicians follow the Unified Order Disposition Policy flows. These flows determine if the order should proceed as intended or if the order should be cancelled and the device returned <strong>as is</strong>. This article explains how the Returned Unrepaired (RUR) process works and how to assist customers who dispute the findings of the SVC. </span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Surface device returned unrepaired with letter</span></span></span></h4>
</div>

<p><span><span><span><span>The SVC will send the following letter when a device is returned as is and the order not completed:</span></span></span><span> </span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><em>&quot;Dear Surface Customer,</em></p>

<p class="indent-1"><em>We have received the device you returned requesting service. After careful inspection, we found signs of physical or intentional damage to the device that is unrelated to a defect in materials or workmanship. This type of damage is not eligible for warranty service, as it is expressly excluded from the Limited Warranty you accepted when you purchased the device. Physical or intentional damage may include (but is not limited to) the following:</em></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><em>Cracked or scratched touchscreen.</em></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><em>Significant cosmetic damage, such as scratches, dents, etc.</em></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><em>Kickstand hinge damage.</em></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><em>Evidence of unauthorized service or attempted disassembly.</em></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><em>Tamper label removed, altered, or otherwise disturbed.</em></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><em>Modifications to internal components.</em></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><em>Serial number removed, mismatched, altered, or otherwise unreadable.</em></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><em>Physical damage due to the causes above voids the warranty for your Surface device. Because of this, your Surface device is not eligible for in-warranty service and it is being returned to you as-is (not serviced).</em></p>

<p class="indent-1"><em>Although your device is not eligible for warranty service, you may return your device and pay for out-of-warranty service. Or, if you have purchased Accidental Damage Protection (ADP) for your Surface Device, certain damage may be covered, and you may file an ADP claim (*). Please contact Surface Support or go online to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.surface.com/service" managed-link="" target="_blank">www.surface.com/service</a> to request a new service order for either out-of-warranty service or to file an ADP claim.</em></p>

<h4><span><span><span><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a>1.2 Types of damage</span></span></span></h4>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Customer induced damage</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span>This is a catch-all label for any direct or indirect damage to a device caused by the customer. </span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> There may be specific device exceptions, see KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4540877" managed-link="" target="_blank">4540877 Procedure: Surface: Customer induced damage exceptions</a>.</p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Minor physical damage</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>This can be any type of minor cosmetic damage, including to the screen (such as a small scratch), device casing, or frame. It is often referred to as wear and tear damage. This type of damage is covered by the standard warranty.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

</div>
</div>

<p><strong>Cracked screen</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>The most common customer induced damage scenario is a cracked screen. This is typically caused by impact damage (such as a fall off a counter or dropped on the ground). This type of damage is not covered by the standard warranty. If a customer sends in a device with a cracked screen to the SVC on an in warranty order and there are no signs of damage caused while the device was in transit, it will be returned to the customer unrepaired with the warranty voided. In this scenario the device is eligible for a paid out of warranty (OOW) order.</span></span></span></span></p>

</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><strong><span>Severe physical damage</span></strong></p>

<p><span>Any type of major damage to the screen, broken case or large case openings, abnormal damage to connectors or ports, broken kickstand, damage to Wi-Fi cover, or UBC. This type of damage is not covered by the standard warranty. If a customer sends a device with severe physical damage into the service center on an in warranty order and there are no signs of damage caused while the device was in transit, it will be returned to the customer unrepaired with the warranty voided. In this scenario the device is eligible for a paid OOW order.</span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Liquid damage</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span>Liquid damage of any kind is not covered by the standard warranty. In the event a customer mentions their device has been submerged or immersed in water or other liquid, frontline support advocates are advised to warn the customer if they send the device in on an in warranty order it will be returned to them as is. They can get support with a paid out of warranty offer.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span> <strong>In-transit damage (Customer to service center)</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Microsoft provides instructions on how to properly package a device for exchange in the order confirmation email the customer receives after order creation. Failure to follow the packaging instructions may result in the service center receiving a damaged device. In the event a package is received damaged by the service center and the service center confirms the damage occurred in transit, the service center will create a TFS work item and work with both the courier and the Variance team to process the exchange order.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><strong>Example 1</strong> &ndash; Damaged in Transit, Courier at Fault -&nbsp;In this scenario, the variance advocate will close the open order and create a one-way exchange order to send the customer a replacement device.</span></span></span><br>
<span asset="4052930" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4052930]</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><strong>Example 2</strong> &ndash; Damaged in Transit due to Insufficient Packaging/Box used</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;- The customer did not use adequate packaging materials and/or a box to ship their device as listed in the terms and conditions of the service request. This is customer induced damage, which is not covered by the warranty.</span></span></span><br>
<span asset="4052934" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4052934]</span></p>

<p><strong>Example 3</strong> &ndash; Damaged in Transit due to Neglect/Insufficient Packaging/Box used<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>- </em>Microsoft provides instructions on how to properly package a device for exchange, (for example, sturdy box and materials) when the order is created. The customer did not use adequate packaging materials to ship their device as listed in the terms and conditions of the service request<em>.</em><br>

<h3><span><span><span><a id="5" name="5"></a>5.&nbsp;Cosmetic inspection of a Surface Studio device and serial number verification</span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span>The service technician will perform a 10 to 15 second inspection of the Surface Studio device to verify no signs of customer induced damage (CID) or tamper. The service technician will verify the following:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>Screen is not cracked or damaged in any way.</span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>Hinge assembly on screen works normally and no shows no signs of damage.</span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>No </span></span></span>s<span>igns of drop/fall damage (For example, dents to device body or cracks in screen).</span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span>No signs of water intrusion or spillage on the device itself.</span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span>If the Surface Studio device has any CID present, the service technician must perform the following steps:</span></li>
</ul>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>Document each instance of CID found on the device in case notes.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Take photos of each instance of CID and send the photos to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:SurfaceStudioEsc@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">SurfaceStudioEsc@microsoft.com</a></span></span></span>.&nbsp;<span><span><span>The email header must adhere to the following format: <strong>Customer Reference Number &ndash; (CID)</strong>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Alert the customer to any damage found and determine if the customer&rsquo;s device is covered by Microsoft Complete with Accidental Damage Protection (ADP).</span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span>If the device is not covered by an ADP warranty, any replacement device would need to be ordered at cost (if hardware replacement is required).</span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span>If device is covered by an ADP warranty, device replacement is covered under warranty.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ol start="4">
	<li><span><span><span>Verify the serial number matches the ticketed device on the order. The service technician can locate the serial number two ways depending on the working state of the device. </span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span>Device powers on, run the Quick Check Tool to determine serial number.</span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span><span><span>Alternatively,&nbsp;the Surface app will display the serial number (will require photos).</span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-2"><span>The device does not power on or does not boot to Windows, locate the serial number from the base of the Surface Studio.</span></li>
