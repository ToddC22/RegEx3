This procedure can be performed either locally or remotely on the computer that is being renamed. Also, the procedure does not require that you to reset or manually re-create the computer account in the domain.<br><br> The Netdom.exe utility can rename a computer that is a member of a Windows Server 2003 domain. However, to rename the computer, you must specify the user accounts that have local administrative permissions and the object of the computer account in Active Directory.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: To rename a domain controller by using the <span class='text-base'>netdom</span> command, the domain functional level must be set to Windows Server 2003. However, this command renames a computer that is joined to a domain. The computer object in the domain is also renamed. Certain services, such as the certification authority, rely on a fixed machine name. If any services of this type are running on the target computer, a computer name change has an adverse effect. Because of this, do not use this command to rename a domain controller. Use the <span class='text-base'>netdom <strong class='sbody-strong'>computername</strong></span> command instead. Or, for additional help, search the Help files for <span class='text-base'>netdom</span>, and then see the &quot;Rename a domain controller: Active Directory&quot; topic. <br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='2'></a>How to Rename a Computer</h3><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Install Windows Server 2003 Support Tools from the Support\Tools folder on the Windows Server 2003 CD-ROM.

Both the Domain Name System (DNS) host label and the NetBIOS name are changed to the new name. If the new name is longer than 15 characters, the NetBIOS name is derived from the first 15 characters. <br><br></li><li>/userd:<strong class='sbody-strong'>Domain</strong>\<strong class='sbody-strong'>UserName</strong>: The user account to be used for the destination domain.

This account is used to make the connection with the computer to be renamed. If omitted, the currently logged on user&#39;s account is used. The user&#39;s domain can be specified as &quot;/uo:domain\user&quot;.

The number of seconds before automatic shutdown can also be provided. The default is 30 seconds.
