They offer online retailers a suite of services including payments, marketing, shipping, and customer engagement tools to simplify the process of running an online store.</p>

<p>Customers pay a monthly subscription fee to Shopify for hosting their business, and this is payed directly to Shopify.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition, advertisers incur advertising cost<span><span><span><span>s from Shopify&rsquo;s partners, (for example, Microsoft Advertising or Google Ads) and these payments are made to the partner directly</span></span></span></span>.</p>

<h3><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. What is the Microsoft Advertising Shopify app</h3>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The Microsoft Advertising Shopify app is an API plug-in that enables merchants to sign-up and manage their Microsoft Advertising Shopping campaigns directly from the Shopify platform. It will run within Shopify, on any platforms that Shopify currently supports. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The application is downloadable from the Shopify platform and uses a built-in API key to access only certain features and functionalities within the Accounts &amp; Billing and the Shopping Campaigns sections of the Microsoft Advertising platform. The Microsoft Advertising Shopify app only accesses the Accounts &amp; Billing sections of the UI to help customers add an initial payment method. All other billing functionality must be completed in the Microsoft Advertising UI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Users can manage their shopping campaigns directly from the app without having to log into the Microsoft Advertising UI.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Payment for clicks on the Microsoft (Bing) network is made directly to Microsoft and not to Shopify. Merchants using the Shopify app pay for clicks the same way all our customers do and can be managed via the Accounts &amp; Billing page.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><a bookmark-id="top" href="top#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3.&nbsp;<span><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>What can users do with the Microsoft Advertising Shopify app?</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span></span></span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The Microsoft Advertising Shopify app is designed to create and manage Microsoft Shopping campaigns. For more information on Shopping campaign functionality, see KB </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3173658" target="_blank"><span><span><span>3173658 Process: Microsoft Advertising: Bing Shopping &amp; Bing Merchant Center</span></span></span></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>. The product catalogue is taken directly from the customer&rsquo;s product list in Shopify.</span></span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Advertisers manage their Microsoft Shopping campaigns directly from within the app itself, though they can sign-in to the Microsoft Advertising UI directly if they wish, using their Microsoft account, and manage their campaigns from within the UI directly.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>By using the Microsoft Advertising app, advertisers can do the following to save time and effort:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Easily create and/or link their Microsoft Advertising account (aka &lsquo;CID&rsquo;) and their Microsoft Merchant Center Store (MMC) account to a Shopify account.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Add an initial payment method to their Microsoft Advertising UI.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Use Shopify as a source for their Product Feed/Catalogue in Microsoft Shopping Campaigns.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Use </span></span><span><span><span><span>Shopify to create and manage their Microsoft Shopping campaigns directly in the Shopify app.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span>Note that only the following Shopping campaign settings can be edited in Shopify: </span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span>Campaign Budget</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Campaign Bid</span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>Product Filters</span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>You can see if a Shopping campaign was created in Shopify by checking either the Campaign Name, Store Name or Feed File Name. If any of these contain&nbsp;<strong>.myshopify.com_ShoppingCampaign</strong>,&nbsp;it means they were created in the app.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Post-GA, the <strong>Activity Name</strong> (taken from Shopify) will also be added to the campaign name.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Post-GA you can also see Shopify customer&rsquo;s within UCM under <strong>Tech Partner</strong>.<br>
	<span asset="4517045" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4517045]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>Within the Microsoft Advertising UI, a standard Shopping campaign will be created, using the Shopify store as a replacement for the usual Product Catalogue. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Although Shopify users will normally manage their campaigns within the Shopify app, the full suite of Bing Shopping features will be available to customers within Microsoft Advertising&rsquo;s UI (for example, Adding Promotional Text or Campaign Priority). </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Changes made in Shopify will automatically update into Microsoft Advertising UI, and vice versa. Advertisers will be able to update Shopify by making the changes within the campaigns in the Microsoft Advertising UI. </span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If a Shopify store is closed, paused, or the subscription fee is not paid, then Shopify&rsquo;s API will automatically pause the customer&rsquo;s campaigns in Microsoft Advertising (and other partner apps) to avoid unexpected charges being added. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong> Changes made by the Shopify app will be shown within the Change History Report, for ease of troubleshooting.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If Microsoft Advertising encounters fraud, fraud pending, or other hold scenarios, the customer will get the usual email notifications, and their Microsoft Advertising account will experience the usual interruption in performance until the issue is resolved. The Microsoft Advertising app will not display these alerts to the customer in the app interface. Non-Microsoft Shopping campaigns within Shopify will continue to run as normal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span> Because the Shopify app relies on an API link to be established on the back-end during campaign creation, Shopify cannot be used to connect with existing Shopping Campaigns. Existing advertisers will need to continue managing their Bing Merchant Store and Product Catalogues for non-Shopify Shopping Campaigns.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="4" name="4"></a>4.<strong>&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span><span>Support scenarios</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span>The following Shopify-driven scenarios are in-scope for CSS Support:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>Educating customers on how the Shopify app integrates with Microsoft Advertising (for example,<em> &ldquo;how does the partnership work?&rdquo; &ldquo;what can I do in Shopify to manage my Shopping campaigns?&rdquo;</em>).</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Helping customers create and/or link their Microsoft Advertising account to Shopify.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Troubleshooting errors encountered using the Shopify app (for example,<em> &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t click &lsquo;publish&rsquo; to make my Shopping campaign changes&rdquo;).</em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Post-setup management/troubleshooting of Shopping campaigns created through Shopify (for example, <em>&ldquo;My changes aren&rsquo;t being reflected in the Microsoft Advertising UI&rdquo;).</em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Troubleshooting editorial issues encountered with Shopping Campaigns.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Billing/payment inquiries related to Microsoft Advertising accounts created via the Shopify app.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Coupon code inquiries relating to Performance based coupons (PBC) received through the Microsoft Advertising Shopify app setup (only applies to new Microsoft Advertising customers).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Account access Requests for Microsoft account or Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>The following Shopify-driven scenarios are out-of-scope for CSS Support:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>How to use Shopify for Store/Product creation/management (for example, <em>&ldquo;How do I set up my business in Shopify?&rdquo; &ldquo;How can I add new products to my Shopify Store?&rdquo; &ldquo;How do I delete my Google campaign in Shopify&rdquo;). </em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Resolving technical issues with Shopify that are not related to Microsoft Advertising (for example, <em>&ldquo;When I click &lsquo;Marketing&rsquo; the page is giving me an error&rdquo; &ldquo;I am getting latency trying to search for apps&rdquo;). </em></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Resolving billing issues related to Shopify subscriptions.&nbsp; </span></span></li>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Resolving login issues related to the Shopify platform</span></span></span></span>.</span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1&nbsp;Educating customers on how the Shopify app integrates with Microsoft Advertising</h4>

<p><span><span>The Shopify app can be used to link Shopify store information to a new/existing Microsoft Advertising account.&nbsp;New Shopping campaigns will then be created, which use the product catalogue information from Shopify to power the ads. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This will allow advertisers to run PPC advertising on Bing&rsquo;s search network via Product Ads, using rich data from Shopify to generate Product Ads based on search user inquiries.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>The Shopify app also makes it easy to create a Microsoft Account if needed, and link this to a Microsoft Advertising account. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>As the customers may be new to Microsoft Advertising, note the following when discussing new account creation: </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>A Microsoft account will be required to create a Microsoft Advertising account.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Once created, the Shopify-driven campaigns can be accessed either through Shopify or directly from the Microsoft Advertising homepage.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Our advertising uses a &lsquo;cost per click&rsquo; model, so advertisers will be charged for the clicks they receive on their Product Ads, and billed as outlined in KB </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3175877" managed-link="" target="_blank">3175877 Process: Microsoft Advertising: How To Pay</a><span><span>. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Shopify subscriptions are paid for separately.</span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Additional ad types and search audiences are available through our platform via non-Shopping campaigns.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span><span>Finding the app in Shopify</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The Microsoft Advertising app is only available within the Shopify platform &ndash; it is not available within the Microsoft Advertising platform itself, or in any other location. Advertisers typically access the app from the Shopify app store. The following walkthrough steps are based around this scenario.</span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>However, advertisers may also go directly to the app via:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>A &lsquo;Recommendations Card&rsquo; within Shopify&rsquo;s UI, suggesting other ways to engage with customers</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.<br>
	<span asset="4470086" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4470086]</span></li>
	<li>When creating/editing a Shopify Campaign &ndash; advertisers can select&nbsp;<strong>Add Activity</strong>&nbsp;from a list of options and select <strong>Microsoft Shopping campaign</strong>, even if the Microsoft Advertising app isn&rsquo;t added to their account yet.<br>
	<span asset="4469104" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4469104]</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span>In either scenario, go straight to <strong>step 4</strong> in the below guide.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>To help walk a customer through finding the Microsoft Advertising app, use the following steps:</span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span>Once logged in to Shopify, ask the customer to select <strong>apps</strong> (within the left-margin) to access their currently installed applications. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>From here, they can select <strong>View the Shopify app Store</strong> to go to the complete app registry (they can also select <strong>Get Support</strong> to reach the available support options we provide).</span></span><br>
	<span asset="4098888" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4098888]</span></li>
	<li>The customer should look for the app named <strong>Microsoft Advertising</strong>. If it&rsquo;s not visible in the list that initially loads, the customer can select the&nbsp;<strong>Search</strong>&nbsp;icon and manually type in the app name. Once located, have them select the app.<br>
	<span asset="4514571" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514571]</span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-2"><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>There are several &lsquo;unofficial&rsquo; apps which are created by Microsoft Partners that also offer varying levels of integration with Microsoft Advertising. Ask the customer to select only the <strong>Microsoft Advertising</strong> app. If customers ask why they should use this one instead of the others, use the following talking point:</span></span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong><em>&ldquo;</em></strong><em>We&rsquo;ve partnered with Shopify directly to create the official Microsoft Advertising&nbsp;app. This app is free to use and will provide you with the most stable API support we can provide. It is the only app which comes with free support from the official Microsoft Advertising team<span><span>.&rdquo;</span></span></em></p>

<ol start="4">
	<li><span><span>After selecting the Microsoft Advertising app option, the customer is taken to the Microsoft Advertising app page, which contains reviews, information, and the option to&nbsp;<strong>Add app</strong>. Ask the customer to select&nbsp;<strong>Add app</strong>&nbsp;to add the app to their Shopify account.<br>
	<span asset="4514572" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514572]</span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>Before the app is added, the customer will be presented with a list of the permissions that the app requires to function. By selecting <strong>Install app,</strong> they agree to these requirements. </span></span><span><br>

<p><span><span>Once a customer selects <strong>Install</strong> <strong>app,</strong> they will need to link their Shopify account with a Microsoft Advertising account. To do this, they should follow these steps: </span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>1. Install the app (described above) and go to the Microsoft Advertising account page within the app.&nbsp;(If advertisers leave the workflow at any point, they can easily return by selecting&nbsp;<strong>Apps</strong> and then selecting the <strong>Microsoft Advertising</strong> app from the available options.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>Note: </strong><span>Throughout the setup process, a checklist will be visible to the customer which will help them keep track on which stage in the setup process they&rsquo;re at.</span><span><span><span><span><br>
<span><span><span><span><span asset="4514575" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514575]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>2. Before proceeding, advertisers will need to select <strong>Disable Shopify Password</strong> to allow API syncing. </span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span> </span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>3. Selecting this will take them to the <strong>Preferences </strong>page. From here, they can de-select the <strong>Enable password </strong>tick-box and <strong>Save</strong> the changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;<span asset="4516917" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4516917]</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>4. Advertisers can now go back into the app settings, (selecting <strong>Apps</strong> and then <strong>Microsoft Advertising</strong>). The customer will be prompted to either <strong><span>Connect</span></strong> their Microsoft Advertising account or <strong><span>Create an Account</span></strong>. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><span><span><strong>Note</strong>: Customers can also select&nbsp;<strong>Contact Microsoft Advertising</strong>&nbsp;to access our support options, if needed.</span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><span asset="4516918" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4516918]</span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span>5. </span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer already has an account, select <strong><span>Connect</span></strong> and skip to step 13.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the customer needs to create a Microsoft Advertising account, ask them to select <strong><span>Create a new account</span></strong>. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1">6.&nbsp;The advertiser will be prompted to enter the Microsoft account they&rsquo;d like to link with their Microsoft Advertising account.<span><span> </span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If the advertiser doesn&rsquo;t have a Microsoft account, they can select <strong>No Account?

<p class="indent-1"><span><span>7. After selecting&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;the advertiser will be taken to the first page of a setup wizard workflow, which will ask them to enter some basic information required to create a Customer Shell in Microsoft Advertising&rsquo;s UI, and agree to our terms and conditions. Once the details are completed and the T&amp;C&rsquo;s are agreed, select&nbsp;<strong>Create Account.</strong></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong>Important: </strong>Customers<strong> </strong>should<strong> </strong>enter the same website information in Microsoft Advertising that they used to register in Shopify. Otherwise, the system will perceive this as a URL conflict and will not sync correctly. Advertisers with Vanity URLs will need to make sure they enter the same URL in Microsoft Advertising&rsquo;s UI that they entered in Shopify.</p>

<p class="indent-1">8.&nbsp;The system will generate a pop-up message for <strong>new</strong> customers, to inform them that a Performance based coupon (PBC) has been applied, and the criteria for it to take effect.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span>9. After selecting <strong>Got it</strong> to confirm understanding, the coupon is validated.&nbsp;If we find that the customer&rsquo;s website URL has been registered with Microsoft Advertising in the past, they will get the following message:<br>
<span asset="4514747" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514747]</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span>10. After confirming their understanding, the customer is prompted to set up their payment method.</span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Advertisers can choose to&nbsp;<strong>Skip payment information</strong>&nbsp;for now and return to this later. If they do so, skip to <strong>step 11</strong>.&nbsp;Coupon codes will automatically be associated to the advertiser shell&nbsp;and will pre-populate back into the &lsquo;Promotional Offer&rsquo; section when the customer returns to this step later.&nbsp;<br>
<span asset="4514748" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514748]</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span>11. </span>Ask the customer to confirm their business location and tax information, and select a billing region/payment option per KB&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3175877" target="_blank">3175877 Process: Microsoft Advertising: How to Pay</a>. Once this section is complete, select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong><span>.<strong> </strong></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><span><span><strong>Note: </strong>Promotional Offer is pre-populated for new customers with their PBC code. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>12. Advertisers will lastly be prompted to enter their Business Location and Business Address. Once this is done, they can select <strong>Save</strong> to end the process.</span></span></span><br>
<span asset="4514749" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514749]</span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span>13. Advertisers will be taken from here directly into the Microsoft Advertising UI. The Microsoft Advertising account creation process is now complete, and the customer can close their browser tab (there is no need to take further action in the Microsoft Advertising UI).<br>
<span asset="4514751" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514751]</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span>14. Ask the advertiser to go back to Shopify&nbsp;and navigate back to the Microsoft Advertising app (within the &#39;apps&rsquo; section).&nbsp;They can now select <strong>Connect</strong> to link their newly created Microsoft Advertising account.<br>
<span asset="4514752" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514752]</span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span>15. The customer will be prompted to sign into their Microsoft Advertising account via their Microsoft account.<br>
<span asset="4514753" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514753]</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>16. Shopify will then ask the customer to choose which Microsoft Advertising account they wish to link to their Shopify account. If multiple accounts exist in the Microsoft Advertising customer shell, the desired account can be chosen via the drop-down here.<br>
<span asset="4514754" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514754]</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-2"><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Only one CID and account can be applied to Shopify at a time.&nbsp;Once a CID and account is linked, a permanent back-end connection to the Shopify account API is created.&nbsp;Customers who try to disconnect and link to a different CID/account will receive a &lsquo;Binding Error&rsquo; message in the Shopify app.</span><span> </span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span asset="4514802" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514802]</span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Customers with Binding Errors must reach out to Microsoft Advertising Support to request the CID or account is unlinked from their Shopify store, before they can connect a new Microsoft Advertising account. You should raise an escalation to Tier 2 to have this connection broken.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>When a CID or account is disconnected, Shopify will auto-pause the campaigns in the Shopify platform and in Microsoft Advertising. If the CID or account is re-linked, the connection is automatically re-established and the campaigns can be resumed; however, they will remain in paused status until manually reactivated in the app.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span> </span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>17. Once the CID and account have been linked, the final step is to associate/create a Microsoft Merchant Center (MMC) account.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span>The Microsoft Advertising app will ask the user to enter the information required to create an MMC. Once entered, the customer can select <strong>Save Changes</strong> to create their MMC account. This must be done for the setup process to be completed, otherwise changes in the app will not be applied to the Microsoft Advertising UI.</span></span></span></p>

	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Although existing Microsoft Advertising users may already have an MMC and see many of the required MMC fields pre-populated, they will still need to select <strong>Save Changes </strong>to create/link their MMC with their Shopify advertising account. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="indent-1"><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Regardless of whether an MMC already exists, all users will be prompted to create a &lsquo;new&rsquo; MMC.

<p><span><span>Shopify will automatically pause campaigns in app services if the Shopify account is not kept up to date with subscription charges and compliance with Shopify policies. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Customers should resolve any Shopify issues with the Shopify support team first, before we continue to troubleshoot.</span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><a id="4.6" name="4.6"></a>4.6&nbsp;Billing/payment queries relating to Shopify campaigns</span></span> <span><span>created in Microsoft Advertising</span></span></h4>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Adding payment method (If skipped initially) </span></span></strong><strong><span lang="EN-GB"></span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span>If you are contacted by a customer asking for help adding a payment method because they skipped adding this originally, you can help them navigate back to the payment method setup workflow by asking them to go to <strong>Apps &gt; Microsoft Advertising Account </strong>and then viewing the &lsquo;Checklist&rsquo; on this page.&nbsp;The option to &lsquo;View Details&rsquo; will be listed next to the checklist item for adding billing information. </span></span></p>

<p><span asset="4514803" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514803]</span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Selecting this will open a pop-up, with a link that will direct the customer back to the Microsoft Advertising workflow outlined in step 8 of <a bookmark-id="4.2" href="#4.2" managed-link=""><span>section 4.2</span></a></span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>. Once the customer is finished, they can come back to Shopify and select <strong>I&rsquo;ve Added Billing Info</strong> to mark this manually as a completed step</span></span></span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>. </span></span></p>

<p><span asset="4514804" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4514804]</span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Other billing inquiries </span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span>If a customer asks for help adding/managing their payment methods for their Shopping campaigns, <strong><em>after adding the initial payment method in Shopify</em></strong>, treat these as standard billing inquiries and solve for these issues using the Microsoft Advertising UI. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Once a payment method has been added, it is not possible to add a new payment method from within the Shopify UI.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>All other billing-related requests, (for example, pulling statements, adding funds, choosing between multiple payment methods, or reports) must be completed within the Microsoft Advertising UI. </span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><a id="4.7" name="4.7"></a>4.7 Coupon code inquiries relating to PBC acquired through the Shopify setup</span></span></h4>

<p><span><span>If a customer is asking whether a coupon was applied, or when a PBC coupon will be redeemed, treat these as standard coupon inquiries and use the Microsoft Advertising UI to resolve the query.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>If a customer claims to have been a new advertiser who did not receive a PBC coupon as part of their Shopify signup experience, (or if you find that a coupon was not applied to a newly created account during the Shopify creation process) take these steps: </span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>Verify that their account was newly created. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Collect the customer&rsquo;s XID and Shopify Store name. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Share this with your SME, who can escalate to the TA.&nbsp; </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>The TA will provide you/your SME with the coupon you can use to apply on the customer&rsquo;s behalf. </span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> Shopify coupons are specially minted to provide Shopify with a cashback reward when a customer register&nbsp;with us. For this reason, we are unable to use standard PBC coupons to resolve missing coupon inquiries. Do not apply standard PBC coupons as a replacement in this scenario, as it will directly damage our relationship with this client.</span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><a id="4.8" name="4.8"></a>4.8 Account access inquiries</span></span></h4>

<p><span><span>Customers requiring help with accessing their Microsoft Advertising account and/or their Microsoft account should be treated as standard advertising customers.&nbsp;Use the appropriate KB and ASD coding to support their request. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Customers requiring help accessing their Shopify account will need to contact Shopify support, as this is out of scope for our team. </span></span></p>

<h3><a id="5" name="5"></a>5.&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>Ticket handling instructions</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h4>5.1 Ticket coding</h4>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Select <strong>Campaign Type</strong> = Shopify Campaign for all customers who contact you regarding campaigns created in Shopify. (Regardless of whether their issue is with the app itself, with billing, or optimization.)</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Use the dedicated ASD coding to capture issues directly relating to import/management within the app.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>For billing, account access, optimization, and any other non-app related questions, code for these normally using the standard ASD code tree and KB solutions. Remember to ensure <strong>Campaign Type</strong> is listed as <strong>Shopify</strong></span></span></span></span><span><span>. </span></span></p>

<h4><a id="5.2" name="5.2"></a>5.2&nbsp;Ticket handling (email inbound)</h4>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Because Shopify requires a dedicated email-inbound option for apps to run on their platform, CSS is required to provide North American email support even though this is not a standard contact medium for customers in that market. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Tickets will arrive in ASD as &lsquo;noreply@shopify.com&rsquo;, (redacted); however, when you select <strong>Reply All</strong> to respond to the email, the customer&rsquo;s contact email will become visible.</p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>If you are assigned an email from a Shopify customer, take the following steps to locate the customer account information in Microsoft Advertising: </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. FAQ</h3>

<p><strong>Q:&nbsp; I&rsquo;m being told I must create a new Microsoft Merchant Center account (MMC) &ndash; does this mean I have to set up my products/catalogue all over again?<br>
A:&nbsp; </strong>Not at all! Once you&rsquo;ve created your MMC in Shopify, your product catalogue will automatically be applied to your new Shopping campaigns in Microsoft Advertising. There may be a delay in delivery whilst editorial checks are run, and we&rsquo;ll be able to help with any editorial concerns that might arise once the checks are completed.</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp; I imported Shopify campaigns into my existing Microsoft Advertising shell, now I&rsquo;m finding out I should have been eligible for a coupon?&nbsp;Where&rsquo;s my coupon?<br>
A:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp; Only net-new Microsoft Advertising customers are eligible for a performance-based coupon, to allow them time to familiarize themselves with how our platform works.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp; Can I connect my Shopify campaigns with existing Microsoft Shopping campaigns?</span></span></strong><strong><span><span><br>
A:&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span><span>Currently only campaigns created in Shopify can be linked with the Shopify platform.&nbsp;For existing Microsoft Shopping campaigns, continue to use your Microsoft Merchant Center and Product Catalogue to manage your advertising. You can create new Shopping Campaigns via Shopify; however, be aware of any possible duplication in products. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp; Can I import my Shopping Campaign setup from Google?<br>
A:&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span><span>The Microsoft Shopping Shopify app does not currently support this workflow.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp; I have existing Shopping Campaigns promoting the same products as my Shopify Campaigns.&nbsp;Do these compete against one another? &nbsp;<br>
A:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp; Yes &ndash; if you are promoting the same products via Shopify and standard Shopping campaigns, Bing will treat these ads as separate entities, which can lead to direct competition. To avoid unnecessary bid competition, we recommend reviewing any existing Shopping campaigns to ensure you are not duplicating your products. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp; I created Shopping campaigns with Shopify but now I want to switch them to a different Product Catalogue.&nbsp;How do I do this? </span></span></strong><strong><span><span><br>
A:&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span><span>Shopping<strong> </strong>Campaigns created with Shopify cannot be unlinked due to back-end API setup. If you would like to run Shopping campaigns via a non-Shopify Product Catalogue,&nbsp;create new Shopping campaigns in the Microsoft Advertising UI account, and pause/delete your Shopify-created Shopping campaigns as needed. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q: How can CSS tell if a customer is a Shopify advertiser?<br>
A: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>The customer<strong> </strong>will be listed as <strong>Tech Partner: Shopify</strong> in UCM.&nbsp;The customer&rsquo;s campaign name will also contain <strong>.myshopify.com_ShoppingCampaign</strong> as part of the name.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp; How soon will campaigns created in Shopify begin delivery on Bing?</span></span></strong><strong><span><span><br>
A:&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span><span>Shopping campaigns created in Shopify will need to pass through all the same editorial checks as a standard Shopping campaign. For this reason, it can take up to three&nbsp;days for newly created campaigns to begin delivery. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp; Can we use Log Me into </span></span>(LMI) view Shopify campaigns/setup?<span><span><br>
A:&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span><span>Yes, we can use LMI to walk customers through the signup/management process.&nbsp;Always get the customer&rsquo;s permission to use LMI before you create a session.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp; I see a few other Microsoft Advertising related apps in the Shopify Store. Do you support these as well? </span></span></strong><strong><span><span><br>
A:&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span><span>Only the official &lsquo;Microsoft Advertising&rsquo;&nbsp;app is supported by CSS. Other apps offering support for Microsoft Advertising are created by third-party developer teams and not in scope for our assistance. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Q:&nbsp; I want to use Promotional Text and/or Campaign Priority for my Shopify campaigns.&nbsp;Where do I do this? </span></span></strong><strong><span><span><br>
A:&nbsp; </span></span></strong><span><span>These aspects of Shopping functionality are not supported in Shopify; however, advertisers can still use these features by logging into the Microsoft Advertising UI and enabling them from within the account. By default, the Campaign Priority is set as <strong>High</strong>.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Q:&nbsp; Is the pilot URL invite link specific to a single user?<br>
A:</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span>&nbsp; No &ndash; this link isn&rsquo;t unique, however the pilots chosen to be included in this test are trusted sources and we don&rsquo;t expect this URL to have been &lsquo;shared around&rsquo;.</span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q:&nbsp; Is there a mock environment we can use to see the Shopify platform?</span></span></span></strong><br>
<span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong> Yes.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>URL</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>:&nbsp; https://www.shopify.com/</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Store Name</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>:&nbsp; mast-test.myshopify.com</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Email</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: unifoon@hotmail.com </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li class="ng-scope"><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Password</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>:&nbsp;MicrosoftTest1982</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Q:&nbsp; Do I need to do anything else to set up UET or track conversions?<br>
A</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>:&nbsp; No. By downloading the Microsoft Advertising app for Shopify, your UET tag is automatically created and the tag is added to every page of your website. There&#39;s nothing more for you to do.</span></span></span></span></span></p>
