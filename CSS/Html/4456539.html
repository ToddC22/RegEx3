<h3><a id="Proc1" name="Proc1"></a>1. Steps</h3>

<p>There is no case severity indication for BC cases in Rave.&nbsp; Unified support in Rave will show Critical and Non-critical severity indication, premier support will show severity A, B or C. If customer requests a Critical or severity A Rave case, it will trigger CritSit support.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Each incident must contain an initial severity per the Initial Response procedure, and incident severity&nbsp;must be kept current. The incident owner will not lower the incident severity until the following conditions are met:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Premier/Unified Support&nbsp;</strong>- agreement from customer or IM&nbsp;written authorization</li>
		<li><strong>Non-Premier</strong> <strong>-</strong>agreement from customer or if severity commitments cannot be met, by customer or Microsoft.
		<ul>
			<li>In case of non-premier customers, if the case is opened at Severity A establish contact with the customer (email and phone) as soon as possible.</li>
			<li>If customer is not available, wait for 20 minutes, phone and email the customer a second time&nbsp;indicating that you will be lowering the severity until you hear back from the customer, copy your manager on the email. Once contact is established raise the severity or negotiate new severity level with customer agreement.&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>&nbsp;If agreement cannot be made, engage the Recovery procedure.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<div class="divvalue">
<h4>CritSits</h4>

<ul>
	<li>When raising or lowering case severity on a CritSit follow these guidelines:
	<ul>
		<li>The severity of a CritSit case should not be lowered until the critical nature/impact of the issue to the customers&#39; regular business operations has been addressed to the point at which both the engineer and the customer are reasonably certain that the issue is unlikely to manifest itself or be escalated again.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The Severity should not be lowered until the customer is comfortable with lowering the severity and specifically agrees to lower it.
	<ul>
		<li>
		<p>The CritSit should stay at a Sev A or 1 status in the following cases:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Some testing has been done on the problem but the customer still feels that there is a business impact. For example, the customer has a QFE (Quick Fix Engineering) that has been tested in their test environment but has not been implemented in production.</li>
			<li>A&nbsp;work around/solution has been found and the customer cannot implement immediately</li>
			<li>The customer is working with a third-party vendor and the customer wants to be sure that the Microsoft technologies are not the reason for their support issue.</li>
			<li>If a customer has to leave work (this could be any time of the day) and there are no additional activities requested by Microsoft for the customer to perform (i.e., the customer is waiting for a QFE from Development), the customer should provide a contact number (home telephone, mobile phone, or pager) where he or she can be reached after-hours. The customer does not have to remain constantly on the telephone with Microsoft. The case owner must make sure that this information is immediately available in the case and ensure that the customer will be available if requested. The case severity SHOULD NOT BE DROPPED and should stay at A/1.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Microsoft reserves the right to reduce the severity of a case, even if the customer disagrees, if relief for the critical impact to the customers&#39; situation has been implemented and no actions have been requested of MSFT in 72 hours or more.&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
