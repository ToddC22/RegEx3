<h3>What is this article about?</h3>

<p>There are several types of billing account violations (formerly known as billing account locks) that can prevent customers from accessing Xbox Live or making purchases through the Microsoft Store or Marketplace. For instance, when a customer states they are unable to access their Xbox billing account, make purchases, or redeem PPC/token codes, and a billing account violation is found on the account, or when a customer receives this message from the console: <em>Can&#39;t retrieve information from Xbox LIVE. Status code 80169d94.</em> This policy describes how to determine whether a customer&#39;s Xbox Live billing account is locked and how to resolve the issue for them.<span class="sbody-italic"></span></p>

<h3 class="sbody-h3"><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Guidelines</h3>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Do not apply a billing account violation to a customer&#39;s account for any reason.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Do not remove a billing account violation unless it is in one of the allowed scenarios (see below).</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Do help a customer manage their account and payment instruments through account.microsoft.com. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span><span><span><span><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 When can I remove a billing account violation?</span></span></span></span></h4>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the violation comment indicates it was locked by customer request.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Removing the violation may be permissible during certain other scenarios; see the scenario table below.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span><span><span><span><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a>1.2 When will an account be locked?</span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Billing account violations may be placed on an Xbox billing account for the following reasons:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>By Account Takeover investigations support: As part of an Account Takeover investigation, the Microsoft-based Advanced Capability Advocates will lock the customer&rsquo;s billing account to prevent further purchases. For information about how to resolve this issue, see the corresponding topic in <span><a bookmark-id="2" href="#2" managed-link="">section 2</a>.</span></span></span><span> </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>For potential fraud or suspicious behavior: Billing accounts are rarely locked for fraud because a risk block is usually placed against the questionable transaction.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>After the customer proceeds with closing their Microsoft account: Occasionally instead of a closed status, an account will display a locked status after a customer has closed their account.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>By a Microsoft product group for various reasons: Product groups within Microsoft may have a reason or need for a billing account violation to be placed on an account. Normally these reasons are unknown to CSS and require investigation.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span><span><span><span><a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a>1.3 Similar symptoms </span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Although exhibiting similar symptoms, the following issues should be addressed using the included references:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft account is marked as compromised: If the customers Microsoft account is marked as compromised, the billing account is not locked; however, the customer will not be able to sign in until they can recover the account. If the customer signs in on the console, they will get an error message indicating that the account has been compromised. If the customer signs in online, they will get a message prompting them to change their password and update their security information (proofs).

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Subscription in decline: The billing account is not locked; however, because the subscription is in a suspended state, the customer will not be able to access online gameplay.

	<li><span><span><span><span>Transaction is flagged as a potential risk (risk rejection): Questionable account activity may result in individual transactions being declined during the purchase process.

<div class="kb-moreinformation-section section">
<p><span><span><span><span>When a customer&#39;s billing account is locked, follow the steps below to verify the type of account lock. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span>1. Check the <strong>Alerts </strong>section in MST to verify that the customer&#39;s account has an alert for a <strong>billing account violation</strong>.
