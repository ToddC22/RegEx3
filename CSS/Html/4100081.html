<h3><span><span><span><span>1. Overview</span></span></span></span></h3>

<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Overview</h4>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span>Australia and New Zealand have Consumer laws that protect the rights of consumers when they purchase or obtain goods and services. To ensure compliance with these laws, we must take special care when responding to customer support cases for Microsoft products and services purchased by these customers (as well as non-Microsoft products purchased from Microsoft stores and other Microsoft direct retail channels). </span></p>

<h4 class="MsoBodyText"><span><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a>1.2 What are consumer guarantees and why do you have to know about them?</span></h4>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span>The Australian Consumer Law (ACL) and New Zealand Consumer Guarantees Act (NZCGA) provide a comprehensive list of &quot;Consumer guarantees&quot; that suppliers and manufacturers must meet. The ACL and NZCGA also set out the remedies that consumers are entitled to when there is a failure to comply with those Consumer guarantees. You should assume that Consumer guarantees apply to customers in Australia and New Zealand for all Consumer products and services, and to commercial and enterprise products and services with price paid less than AUD $40,000 (under the ACL).</span></p>

<table class="table">

			<td width="471">
			<p class="MsoBodyText"><span><strong>Consumer guarantees are in addition to any rights a customer has under Microsoft&#39;s limited or express warranties (including extended service plans). Consumer guarantees usually last longer than these express warranties.

<h3>2. Key issues</h3>

<h4><span><span lang="EN-AU"><span><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1&nbsp;What is guaranteed: Products and services must be of an acceptable quality</span></span></span></h4>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span>A product <strong>is not of an acceptable quality</strong> when:</span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="MsoBodyText">It is unsafe.</li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText">It stops working as it should.</li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText">It has defects.</li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText">It is provided to the customer scratched, dented or otherwise defective.</li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText">It is broken or breaks after a customer takes it home and uses it (and the customer didn&#39;t cause the break).</li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText">It doesn&rsquo;t match the description on the packaging.</li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText">It doesn&rsquo;t do what the product of that type is supposed to do.</li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText">If Microsoft sold the product direct to the consumer from a Microsoft store, and it doesn&rsquo;t do what the customer told the Microsoft store they wanted it to do, or what the Microsoft store said it would do.</li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span> Services are <strong>not of an acceptable quality</strong> if: </span><span> </span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span>They are not provided with acceptable care and skill or technical knowledge.</span><span> </span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span>The provider of the services has not taken all necessary steps to avoid loss and damage.</span><span> </span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span>They are not fit for the purpose or give the results that the customer and the supplier had agreed to.</span><span> </span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span>They are not delivered within a reasonable time when there is no agreed end date.</span></li>
</ul>

<h4 class="MsoBodyText"><span><span lang="EN-AU"></span><span lang="EN-AU"><span><a id="2.2" name="2.2"></a>2.2 Duration of the Consumer guarantees</span></span></span></h4>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span><strong><span lang="EN-AU"></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> There is no set time period for how long the Consumer guarantees last. It depends on the price and type of product. </span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> For example, for products like Surface computers and Xbox consoles, Microsoft has determined that the Consumer guarantees will last at least two years after purchase. </span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> Often, Consumer guarantees will last longer than the express warranty that the manufacturer gives to the customer.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4 class="MsoBodyText"><span><span lang="EN-AU"><span><a id="2.3" name="2.3"></a>2.3. The type of failure determines the type of remedy </span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-AU"></span></strong></span><span>The type of remedy a customer is owed depends on whether there is a major or minor failure. </span></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span>What is a </span><strong><span>minor failure</span></strong><span>?<span lang="EN-AU"><span> </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span>Usually something that can be fixed with a quick replacement (or repair if applicable) within a reasonable time.<br>
	<br>
	For example, a button on an Xbox controller gets stuck. This is most likely a minor failure that is easy to fix with a repair, <span>exchange</span><span lang="EN-AU"><span> </span></span><span lang="EN-AU"><span> </span></span> or replacement. </span></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span>What remedy is a customer entitled to <strong>if there is a </strong></span><strong><span>minor failure</span></strong><span>?</span></p>

<ul>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><strong>The retailer or manufacturer</strong> can choose what type of remedy the customer will get. It will most likely be an exchange or replacement, as Microsoft does not offer repairs for most products.</li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText">If the product cannot be replaced, repaired or exchanged within a reasonable time, or if the problem recurs in two or more replacements, the customer can demand a refund instead.</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>What is a <strong>major failure</strong>?</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the product does not do what was told or demonstrated it would do.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the product is unfit for the purpose for which it was sold.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the product is unfit for a purpose for which goods of the same kind are commonly supplied.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The product is not safe to use. </span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-AU"><span>Note</span></span></strong><span lang="EN-AU"><span>: If there is a claim or suspicion that a Microsoft product is unsafe, you must immediately follow the Rapid Response Team/Product Safety (RRT) procedure.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Ask yourself: would the customer have still bought this product if they had known about the problem? </span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the answer is no, then it is likely a major failure and they are entitled their choice of a repair (if applicable), replacement or refund.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>For example:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>An Xbox console catches fire and burns its surrounds. This is a major failure, as it is unsafe.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Packaging on a USB mouse says it is compatible with all devices, but the customer discovers it is not. This is a major failure, as the customer wouldn&#39;t have bought it if they had known.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>A customer told Microsoft Store they wanted a HD webcam. The webcam they were sold was not HD.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>A customer has returned a Surface Pro twice in succession because the touch screen did not work both times.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>What remedy is a customer entitled to <strong>if there is a major failure</strong>?</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>The customer</span></span></strong><span><span> can choose which type of remedy they will get: replacement or refund.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4 class="MsoBodyText"><span><a id="2.4" name="2.4"></a>2.4&nbsp;Interaction of Consumer guarantees with other warranties </span></h4>

<ul>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> Microsoft products and services, and third-party products and services sold by Microsoft stores, often come with a manufacturer&#39;s warranty (also known as an express warranty or guarantee) which is often called a &#39;limited warranty&#39; or &#39;limited hardware warranty&#39;. Microsoft or a third party may also provide an extended services warranty which extends the coverage available to the customer.</span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> Consumer guarantees <strong>operate separate from, and in addition to, </strong>these express warranties<strong> </strong>to protect the consumer. </span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> If a customer&#39;s product has a failure, they may be entitled to remedies under the Consumer guarantees, or an express warranty or extended service warranty (if applicable) or both.</span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> Often, Consumer guarantees will last longer than the express warranty that the manufacturer gives to the customer (if applicable).&nbsp;Even if the express warranty has expired, if the customer still has Consumer guarantee rights, we must honor those rights.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4 class="MsoBodyText"><span><a id="2.5" name="2.5"></a>2.5&nbsp;Who can the customer obtain a remedy from?</span></h4>

<ul>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> It is the customer&#39;s choice who they contact. The customer can ask for a remedy either from the manufacturer or the retailer.</span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> Never tell the customer they can seek a remedy only from either the retailer or manufacturer. </span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> If the product was <strong>supplied directly by Microsoft,</strong> even if manufactured by a third party, Microsoft must provide the consumer with a remedy if they are entitled to it. If the problem was caused by the third-party manufacturer, Microsoft as the supplier can later ask the manufacturer for compensation.&nbsp; Do not tell the customer that they can only go to the manufacturer for a remedy (however, the customer may prefer to deal with the manufacturer). </span></li>
	<li class="MsoBodyText"><span> If the product is a <strong>Microsoft product purchased from a third-party retailer</strong>, Microsoft has obligations as a manufacturer. Customers can choose whether they want to receive a remedy from the retailer or from Microsoft, and you shouldn&#39;t tell the customer that they can only go to the retailer for a remedy. If the customer chooses to obtain a remedy from the retailer, that remedy will be a repair, replacement or refund, depending on the fault. &nbsp;If the customer prefers to deal with Microsoft, it is Microsoft&#39;s policy to offer the customer a replacement for a minor fault, and a replacement or refund for a major fault. If there is a major fault, the customer may also have the right to recover compensation for damages and loss from Microsoft.</span></li>
