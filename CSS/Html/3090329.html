<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This TSG provides guidance on how to apply&nbsp;EA Overage&nbsp;to Monetary Credit (MC).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;This TSG applies to SEs and TAs who are monitoring the following queues:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>MSaaS ASMS EAL MCA&nbsp;</strong>(Global English and non-APJ LL; includes USG)</li>
	<li><strong>MSaaS ASMS EAL MCA - APJ Local Language&nbsp;</strong>(Mandarin, Korean)</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="Context" name="Context"></a>Context</h4>

<p>If a customer consumes more than their prepaid initial Azure commitment, they will accrue overage charges which will be billed back to the customer in arrears. Overage is billed per billing cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The customer&rsquo;s price sheet in the EA portal will show the pre-payment price as well as the overage price.</p>

<h3><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</h3>

<p>Use the criteria in <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://empguide.trafficmanager.net/concession/1963" managed-link="" target="_blank">EmpGuide1963</a> to determine whether MC can be used to offset overages.</p>

<p><span>Enrollments that start after May 1, 2018 will have overage billed monthly.</span></p>

<p>For enrollments that began before May 1, 2018, indirect customers are billed quarterly by default. Direct customers are billed annually by default, but are switched to quarterly billing if the customer spends 150% of their initial commitment in overage.<span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Notes:</span></span></strong><span><span> </span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>EmpGuide 1963 </span></span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span> </span><span><span>is not applicable for Charges Billed Separately and Marketplace services that do not consume MC.</span></span></li>
	<li>Certain third-party services consume MC. An updated list can be found on the EA portal.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<ul>
	<li><span><span>The customer asks to offset their overages with new MC that they have purchased on the same enrollment. </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span>After enrollment transfer, the customer asks to offset their overages on the source enrollment with the MC on the target enrollment.</span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="Basic Checks" name="Basic Checks"></a>Basic Checks</h4>

<p>Before performing the procedure below, check the following pieces of information to make sure the request meets the criteria for applying overages. If the criteria are not satisfied, reject the request.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The enrollment number where overage has been incurred</li>
	<li>If an enrollment transfer has taken place, the enrollment number where MC is available.<br>
	<strong>Note: </strong>If no enrollment transfer has taken place, the two enrollment numbers should be the same.</li>
	<li>The months for which overage will be paid for using MC</li>
	<li>The available MC</li>
	<li>The amount of funds to be applied</li>
	<li><span>The PO number (optional)</span><span> </span><span> </span></li>
	<li><span>The month closed</span><span> </span><br>
	<strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> The month end job runs on the 2<sup>nd</sup> of the following month, UTC time. It is advisable to wait until the 3<sup>rd</sup> or 4<sup>th</sup> of the month to check the finalized charges for the previous month.</span></span></li>
	<li>Whether the account that incurred overage is within one year of the billing end date of an invoice</li>
	<li>Whether there is enough MC to cover the full total of incurred charges</li>
	<li>Credit and Rebill of Overage invoice<span> </span> required<span> </span><span> </span></li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="SE Directions" name="SE Directions"></a>SE Directions</h4>

<ol>
	<li>Validate approvals for the request. If the request did not come from one of the necessary approvers, request approval.
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Approval for Direct Enrollment should come from a Non Read-Only Enterprise Administrator, or a Bill-to Contact or Billing Administrator.</li>
		<li>Approval for Indirect Enrollment should come from a Partner Administrator, Bill-to Contact.&nbsp;</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>If the request satisfies the criteria in <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://empguide.trafficmanager.net/concession/1963" managed-link="" target="_blank">EmpGuide 1963</a> and is from a person authorized to make the request, raise a Credit Request following the directions in <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4094770" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 4094770</a><span> </span>. Inform the requestor that the request has been submitted for review.<br>
	<strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>SEs may use existing empowerment levels to pre-approve the requests when raising Credit Issue tickets.&nbsp;This screenshot shows how the&nbsp;1963 adjustment appears in the EA Admin Portal:<br>
	<span asset="4575900" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4575900]</span></li>
	<li>When the credit request&nbsp;is marked <strong>Done</strong>, update the requestor accordingly and update the SR status to <strong>Waiting for Confirmation</strong>.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>If Credit or Rebill is necessary, monitor the invoices and close out the SR after the necessary invoices have been properly issued.</li>
</ol>

<h4><a id="Common Issue—Insufficient MC Purchased" name="Common Issue—Insufficient MC Purchased"></a>&nbsp;Insufficient MC Purchased</h4>

<p>A customer who has purchased insufficient MC to cover a full overage period may ask to partially pay down the overage in order to avoid losing MC to expiration. In this case, advise the customer to contact the account team to reduce their MC order to a lower value in order to eliminate their financial risk. The customer should work with their partner to credit out the insufficient MC order and either pay the overage or rebill a new MC order that is sufficient to cover the overage.</p>

<h4><strong><a id="M488 Concession: Sharing of MC Between Cloud Instances" name="M488 Concession: Sharing of MC Between Cloud Instances"></a>Amendment M448: <span><span>Sharing of MC Between Cloud Instances</span></span></strong></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>Customers may contact support requesting that EA 1 utilize the MC from EA 2<em>. </em>Typically, this ask comes from the partner or account team. However, customers may contact support directly when the M448 has not been properly applied&nbsp;or is not complete. </span></span></span></span><em></em></p>

<p><strong>What is Amendment M448?</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>M448 entitles two separate enrollments to cross share an MC balance. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>However, the two EAs cannot be in the same cloud. One will need to be in the Gov cloud while the other in the Commercial cloud.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The amendment must be applied to both enrollments at the agreement level (can be verified in Explore.ms).</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The act of offsetting the overage is done at month&rsquo;s closing and the overage amount is applied to the correlating EA&rsquo;s MC balance for the preceding month (before invoicing is completed).</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>The MC amount for the desired month must be sufficient enough to handle the whole overage amount for the month. Otherwise, the overage will be billed on the respective EA. </span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>The </span></span></span><span><span><span>Field team facing link to M448, can be found in <a href="https://empguide-v4.trafficmanager.net/concession/2193." managed-link="" target="_blank">Empguide 2193</a>.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Steps to apply Amendment M448</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><strong>Verify the two environments, to ensure there is a <em>Government</em> Cloud and a <em>Commercial</em> Cloud.</strong> The Clouds cannot be the same environment.<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Verify the Amendment is <em>Active</em> on both enrollments</strong>. Each enrollment will need to have an amendment applied. The ROC is responsible for applying the amendment to these enrollments.
	<ul>
		<li>If an Account Team or Partner believes an M448 should be applied to an Enrollment but <em>explore.ms </em>does not have it listed, direct them to engage the ROC. No further actions can be conducted by support until the Amendment is applied.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span><strong>Verify that the Overage amount for the desired month is still showing as <em>valid </em>before determining that the M448 is not executing.</strong> The current month overage should always show as valid as the transferring of MC is not completed until the closing of the month.</span></p>

	<ul>
		<li>
		<p><span>I</span><span style="font-size:0.9375rem">f the M448 is already a</span><em style="font-size:0.9375rem">ctive</em><span style="font-size:0.9375rem">, the overage EA will contain the closed months overage amount for each month showing as a </span><strong style="font-size:0.9375rem"><em>credit</em> adjustment</strong><span style="font-size:0.9375rem"> on the </span><strong style="font-size:0.9375rem"><em>Overage</em></strong><span style="font-size:0.9375rem"> </span><strong style="font-size:0.9375rem"><em>enrollment</em></strong><span style="font-size:0.9375rem"> and </span><strong style="font-size:0.9375rem"><em>debit</em></strong><span style="font-size:0.9375rem"> </span><strong style="font-size:0.9375rem">adjustment</strong><span style="font-size:0.9375rem"> on the </span><em style="font-size:0.9375rem">MC EA<strong>.</strong></em></p>
		</li>
		<li>
		<p><span><span><span>If the M448 is not executing, the past closed month&rsquo;s overage amounts will still show as valid on the overage EA. </span></span></span></p>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><strong>Verify that the MC balance is sufficient.</strong> If the existing month&rsquo;s MC balance is greater than the Overage amount, proceed to the next step.&nbsp;</p>

	<ul>
		<li>If the MC is less than the Overage amount, inform the customer that they have insufficient MC and the M448 cannot be executed until a sufficient MC amount is provisioned.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Submit a Credit TFS to request the offset.&nbsp;</strong>Use the credit reason <strong>CS 29&nbsp;</strong>(Out of Policy: Utilization Transfer) when submitting the request.&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span>Once submitted, this will trigger an offset and act as the verification that the M448 is active going forward. </span></span>Commerce Engagement team (Azure Ops) will be aware of the active M448 on the desired enrollments.</span></li>
		<li>As long as the MC amount is sufficient enough to handle the previous months overage on the linked EA, the offset should be conducted in the following month.<br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Once credited, verify that the correct invoices have been deployed.</strong>&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>Once the credit is complete and the adjustments are showing, ensure any assocated invoices are cancelled out via a seperate TFS Issue.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>After all steps are completed, the overages should no longer exist, as they should have been deducated to the MC EA. Adjustment will be visible on both enrollments, as a credit adjustment in the Overage EA and a Debit adjustment on the MC.</li>
		<li>Any invoices that were deployed prior to the transferring of MC, should be fully cancelled out on the Overage EA.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
