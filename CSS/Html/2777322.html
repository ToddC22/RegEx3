<p><strong><u>If a Premier customer is having issues filing a Premier ticket in Ibiza, it may be due to mapping.</u></strong></p>

<p><span>There are three ways a Premier contract can be mapped in Ibiza:</span></p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p><span>Auto Match &ndash; if the customer logs in to MPO (Premier Portal) with an MSA, and they use the same MSA to login to Azure, we automatically add their Premier information in Ibiza (for all customer subs the have write access to)</span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Cloud Knows Premier (CKP) &ndash; based on TPID matching, if the same company pays for both Premier and Azure, or the TAM performed a manual matching in Unicorn, Premier plans will also show up automatically in Ibiza, linked to specific subs part of the matching.&nbsp; If the TAM needs assistance with TPID mapping, have them reach out to the finsup alias. </span></p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p><span>Manual Linking &ndash; using manual linking, the customer can add a Premier contract by using a Contract ID and Access ID, which will be linked permanently to their Azure account and available on all subs they have write access to</span></p>

<p><u><strong><span><span>Customer is unable to create support ticket:</span></span></strong></u></p>

<p><span><span>The Support Ticket creation logic has moved to the Ibiza portal.</span></span></p>

<p>For EA and EA Gov&nbsp;customers, confirm whether&nbsp;they have a Support entitlement via the EA portal. If they do and are still&nbsp;unable to open a Support case, engage the Azure EngSys team as noted below.</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>EA Admins cannot submit tickets in the Azure Portal; only Account Administrators can.</p>

<p>For customers of all&nbsp;other subscription types, c<span>reate a Sev-3 IcM ticket and assign to the Azure EngSys Case Submission&nbsp;team. They will then triage and provide a resolution.</span></p>
