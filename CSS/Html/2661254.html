This advisory announces that the use of RSA certificates that have keys that are less than 1024 bits long will be blocked. To view the security advisory, go to the following Microsoft website:<br><div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-1' href='http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2661254' target='_self'>http://technet.microsoft.com/security/advisory/2661254</a></div>To reduce the risk of unauthorized exposure of sensitive information, Microsoft has released a nonsecurity update (KB 2661254) for all supported versions of Microsoft Windows. This update will block cryptographic keys that are less than 1024 bits long. This update does not apply to Windows 8 Release Preview or Windows Server 2012 Release Candidate because these operating systems already include the functionality to block the use of weak RSA keys that are less than 1024 bits long. </div><div class='kb-moreinformation-section section'>The strength of public-key-based cryptographic algorithms is determined by the time that it takes to derive the private key by using brute-force methods. The algorithm is considered to be strong enough when the time that it takes to derive private key is prohibitive enough by using the computing power at disposal. The threat landscape continues to evolve. Therefore, Microsoft is further hardening the criteria for the RSA algorithm with key lengths that are less than 1024 bits long. <br><br>After the update is applied, only certificate chains that are built by using the <span class='text-base'><a id='kb-link-2' href='http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa376078.aspx' target='_self'>CertGetCertificateChain</a></span> function are affected. The CryptoAPI builds a certificate trust chain and validates that chain by using time validity, certificate revocation, and certificate policies (such as intended purposes). The update implements an additional check to make sure that no certificate in the chain has an RSA key length of less than 1024 bits.<br><br><br><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Update replacement information</h4>This update replaces the following update: <div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-3' href='/en-us/help/2677070'>2677070 </a> An automatic updater of revoked certificates is available for Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 7, and Windows Server 2008 R2 <br></div><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Known issues with this security update</h3>After the update is applied:<br><ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>A restart is required. </li><li>A certification authority (CA) cannot issue RSA certificates that have a key length of less than 1024 bits. </li><li>CA service (certsvc) cannot start when the CA is using an RSA certificate that has a key length of less than 1024 bits. </li><li>Internet Explorer will not allow access to a website that is secured by using an RSA certificate that has a key length of less than 1024 bits. </li><li>Outlook 2010 cannot be used to encrypt email if it is using an RSA certificate that has a key length of less than 1024 bits.

You can do this by viewing (usually by double-clicking) any certificate that was issued internally. On the <span class='text-base'>Certification Path</span> tab, click <span class='text-base'>View Certificate</span> for each certificate in the chain to make sure that all RSA certificates are using at least 1024 bit key lengths. <br><br>For example, the certificate in the following figure was issued to a domain controller (2003DC.adatum.com) from an Enterprise Root CA named AdatumRootCA. You can select the AdatumRootCA certificate on the <span class='text-base'>Certification Path</span> tab. <br><br><img class="graphic" src="/Library/Images/2744237.jpg" alt="Certification Path tab " title="Certification Path tab "><br><br>To see the AdatumRootCA certificate, click <span class='text-base'>View Certificate</span>. On the <span class='text-base'>Details</span> pane, select <span class='text-base'>Public key</span> to see the key size, as shown in the following figure. <br><br><img class="graphic" src="/Library/Images/2744240.jpg" alt="View Certificate " title="View Certificate "><br><br>The RSA certificate for AdatumRootCA in this example is 2048 bits.<br><br><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Use CAPI2 logging </h4>On computers that are running Windows Vista or Windows Server 2008 or later versions of Windows, you can use CAPI2 logging to help identify keys that have a length of less than 1024 bits. You can then allow the computers to perform their usual operations and later check the log to help identify keys that have a length of less than 1024 bits. Then, you can then use that information to track down the sources of the certificates and make the necessary updates. <br><br>To do this, you must first enable verbose diagnostic logging. To enable verbose mode logging, follow these steps:<br><br>1. Open Registry Editor (Regedit.exe). <br><br>2. Navigate to the following registry key:<br><br><div class='indent'> HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\crypt32</div><br><br>3. Add a DWORD (32-bit) value <span class='text-base'>DiagLevel </span>with value of 0x00000005.<br><br>4. Add a QWORD (64-bit) value <span class='text-base'>DiagMatchAnyMask </span>with value of 0x00ffffff.<br><br><img class="graphic" src="/Library/Images/2756590.jpg" alt="DiagMatchAnyMask " title="DiagMatchAnyMask "><br><br>After you do this, you can then enable CAPI2 operational logging in the Event Viewer. The CAPI2 Operational log is located under <span class='text-base'>Applications and Service Logs</span>, <span class='text-base'>Microsoft</span>, <span class='text-base'>Windows</span>, and <span class='text-base'>CAPI2</span> in Event Viewer. To enable logging, right-click the <span class='text-base'>Operational</span> log, click <strong class='uiterm'>Enable Log</strong>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Filter Current Log</strong>. Click the <strong class='uiterm'>XML</strong> tab, and then click to select the <strong class='uiterm'>Edit query manually</strong> check box.<br><img class="graphic" src="/Library/Images/2744250.jpg" alt="Enable Log " title="Enable Log "><br><br>After you have collected the log, you can use the following filter to reduce the number of entries that you have to search throughto find certificate operations with keys that have a length of less than 1024 bits. The following filter looks for keys of 512 bits. <br><br>&lt;QueryList&gt;<br><br>&lt;Query Id=&quot;0&quot; Path=&quot;Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational&quot;&gt;<br><br>&lt;Select Path=&quot;Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational&quot;&gt;Event[UserData[CertGetCertificateChain[CertificateChain[ChainElement[PublicKeyAlgorithm[@publicKeyLength=&#39;512&#39;]]]]] and UserData[CertGetCertificateChain[CertificateChain[ChainElement[PublicKeyAlgorithm[@publicKeyName=&#39;RSA&#39;]]]]]]&lt;/Select&gt;<br><br>&lt;/Query&gt;<br><br>&lt;/QueryList&gt;<br><br><img class="graphic" src="/Library/Images/2744251.jpg" alt="Filter current log " title="Filter current log "><br><br>You can also query for multiple key lengths with a single query. For example, the following filter queries for 384-bit keys and 512-bit keys. <br><br>&lt;QueryList&gt;<br><br>&lt;Query Id=&quot;0&quot; Path=&quot;Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational&quot;&gt;<br><br>&lt;Select Path=&quot;Microsoft-Windows-CAPI2/Operational&quot;&gt;Event[UserData[CertGetCertificateChain[CertificateChain[ChainElement[PublicKeyAlgorithm[@publicKeyLength=&#39;384&#39;]]]]] and UserData[CertGetCertificateChain[CertificateChain[ChainElement[PublicKeyAlgorithm[@publicKeyName=&#39;RSA&#39;]]]]]] or Event[UserData[CertGetCertificateChain[CertificateChain[ChainElement[PublicKeyAlgorithm[@publicKeyLength=&#39;512&#39;]]]]] and UserData[CertGetCertificateChain[CertificateChain[ChainElement[PublicKeyAlgorithm[@publicKeyName=&#39;RSA&#39;]]]]]]&lt;/Select&gt;<br><br>&lt;/Query&gt;<br><br>&lt;/QueryList&gt;<br><br><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Check certificate templates</h4>You can run the following query on your Certification Authorities (CAs) to discover certificate templates that use keys of less than 1024 bits:<br><br><div class='indent'><span class='text-base'>certutil -dstemplate | findstr &quot;[ msPKI-Minimal-Key-Size&quot; | findstr /v &quot;1024 2048 4096&quot;</span></div><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span> You should run the command in each forest in your organization. <br><br>If you run this query, templates that use keys that are smaller than 1024 bits will be shown with their key size. The following figure shows that two of the built-in templates, SmartcardLogon and SmartcardUser, have default key lengths that have minimum key sizes of 512 bits. You may also discover other templates that were duplicated with minimum key sizes of less than 1024 bits. <br><br>For each template that you discover that allow less than 1024 bit keys, you should determine whether it is possible to issue certificates as shown in the <span class='text-base'>Certificate Templates </span>section of the Certification Authority console. <br><br><img class="graphic" src="/Library/Images/2744252.jpg" alt="Certificate Templates section " title="Certificate Templates section "><br><br><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Enable logging on computers that have the update installed</h4>You can use registry settings to enable computers that have the update applied to locate RSA certificates with key lengths of less than 1024 bits. The option for implementing logging is described in the &quot;Resolutions&quot; section because it is closely coupled with the registry settings that can be used to allow key lengths of less than 1024 bits. See the &quot;Allow key lengths of less than 1024 bits by using registry settings&quot; section later in this article for more information about how to enable logging. </div><div class='kb-summary-section section'>The primary resolution for any issue that is related to blocking of a certificate that has a key length of less than 1024 bits is to implement a larger (1024 bit key length or larger) certificate. We recommend that users implement certificates that have a key length of at least 2048 bits.<br><br><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Increase the key size for certificate issued through certificate autoenrollment</h4>For templates that issued RSA certificates with key lengths of less than 1024 bits, you should consider increasing the minimum key size to a setting of at least 1024 bits. This assumes that the devices to which these certificates are issued support a larger key size. <br><br>After you increase the minimum key size, use the <span class='text-base'>Reenroll All Certificate Holders</span> option in the <strong class='uiterm'>Certificate Templates Console</strong> to cause the client computers to Reenroll and request a larger key size. <br><br><img class="graphic" src="/Library/Images/2744253.jpg" alt="Smartcard Logon " title="Smartcard Logon "><br><br>If you have issued certificates by using the built-in Smartcard Logon or Smartcard User templates, you will be unable to adjust the minimum key size of the template directly.

Customers may however need a temporary workaround while a longer term solution is developed to replace RSA certificates with a key length of less than 1024 bits length. In these cases, Microsoft is providing the customers the ability to change the way the update functions. Customers configuring these settings are accepting the risk that an attacker may be able to break their certificates and use them to spoof content, perform phishing attacks, or perform Man-in-the-Middle attacks. <br><br><span><span class='text-base'>Important </span>This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br><div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-6' href='/en-us/help/322756 '>322756  </a>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows </div></span>On Windows 8 or Windows Server 2012-based computers that have the update applied, the following registry path and settings can be used to control detection and blocking of RSA certificates with less than 1024 bit key lengths. <br><br>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CertDLLCreateCertificateChainEngine\Config<br><br>There are four main values that control how keys under 1024 bits blocking works. These are as follows:<br><ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>MinRsaPubKeyBitLength</li><li>EnableWeakSignatureFlags</li><li>WeakSignatureLogDir</li><li>WeakRsaPubKeyTime</li></ul>Each of these values and what they control are discussed in the following sections. <br><br>For operating systems starting with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008, you can use <span class='text-base'>certutil </span>commands to change these registry settings. On Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Server 2003 R2, you cannot use <span class='text-base'>certutil </span>commands to change these registry settings. However, you can use Registry Editor, reg command, or reg file.<br><br><h4 class='sbody-h4'>MinRsaPubKeyBitLength</h4><span class='text-base'>MinRsaPubKeyBitLength</span> is a DWORD value that defines the minimum allowed RSA key length. By default, this value is not present, and the minimum allowed RSA key length is 1024. You can use certutil to set this value to 512 by running the following command:<br><br><span class='text-base'>certutil -setreg chain\minRSAPubKeyBitLength 512</span><br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span>All certutil commands shown in this article require local Administrator privileges because they are changing the registry.

These settings change the behavior of how the keys under 1024 bits detection and blocking works. The settings are described in the following table:<br><div class='table-responsive'><table class='sbody-table table'><tr class='sbody-tr'><td class='sbody-td'>Decimal value</td><td class='sbody-td'>Description</td></tr><tr class='sbody-tr'><td class='sbody-td'>2</td><td class='sbody-td'>When enabled, the root certificate (during chain building) is allowed to have an RSA certificate with a key length of less than 1024 bits.

For example, C:\Under1024KeyLog could be the data for this value. This option is required when EnableWeakSignatureFlags is set to 4 or 8. Make sure that you configure the security on the specified folder so that both <span class='text-base'>Authenticated Users</span> and the local group <span class='text-base'>All Application Packages</span> have modify access. To set this value for C:\Under1024KeyLog, you can use the following certutil command:<br><br><span class='text-base'>Certutil -setreg chain\WeakSignatureLogDir &quot;c:\Under1024KeyLog&quot;</span><br><br>You can also configure the WeakSignatureLogDir to write to a network shared folder. Make sure that you have the appropriate permissions configured for the network location so that all configured users can write to the shared folder. The following command is an example of configuring the WeakSignatureLogDir to write to a folder named <span class='text-base'>Keys</span> that is in a network shared folder named <span class='text-base'>RSA</span> on <span class='text-base'>Server1</span>:<br><br><span class='text-base'>Certutil -setreg chain\WeakSignatureLogDir &quot;\\server1\rsa\keys&quot;</span><h4 class='sbody-h4'>WeakRsaPubKeyTime</h4>The WeakRsaPubKeyTime is an 8 byte REG_BINARY value that contains a Windows FILETIME data type stored as UTC/GMT. This value is available primarily to reduce potential problems by blocking keys that have a length of less than 1024 bits for Authenticode signatures. Certificates that are used to sign code before the configured date and time are not checked for keys that have a length of less than 1024 bits. By default this registry value is not present and is treated as early morning January 1, 2010 at midnight UTC/GMT. <br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span>This setting is only applicable to when a certificate was used to Authenticode sign a time stamped file. If the code is not time stamped, then the current time is used and the WeakRsaPubKeyTime setting is not used. <br><br>The WeakRsaPubKeyTime setting allows for the configuration of the date for which to consider older signatures valid. If you have reason to set a different date and time for the WeakRsaPubKeyTime, you will can use certutil to set a different date. For example, if you wanted to set the date to August 29, 2010, you could use the following command: <br><br><span class='text-base'>certutil -setreg chain\WeakRsaPubKeyTime @08/29/2010</span><br><br>If you must set a specific time, such as 6:00 PM on July 4, 2011, then add the number of days and hours in the format +[dd:hh] to the command.
