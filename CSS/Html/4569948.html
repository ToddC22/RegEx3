<p><strong>Customer education:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>When we see activity in the user&#39;s account that looks like someone else might have gotten their password, we lock the account to prevent anyone from accessing their personal information. &nbsp;</li>
	<li>Customers are prompted to verify their account with a security code when first signing in after an account is compromised.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;Is the customer able to verify the account?</p>
<ul>
	<li>If customers can verify their account with a security code, they will see message &#39;help us secure you account&#39; at sign in. Select <strong>Next </strong>to continue.</li>
	<li>The customer will be asked to change the password then <strong>Next </strong>to continue.</li>
</ul>

<p>The user will be asked to review their security info and&nbsp;remove or edit the information&nbsp;as necessary.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Important: </strong>If there are any pieces of security info listed that a user does not recognize or can no longer use, they should select the checkbox next to that item to uncheck and remove it from the list of their security info.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Note: </strong>If the user does remove security info, advise that they should sign in to <a href="http://account.microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://account.microsoft.com</a> after finishing this and replace removed security info with new security info.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The user will receive confirmation that their account is now unlocked and they can sign in as usual with their new password.</li>
	<li>After changing password, check the account to determine if there were unauthorized activities.</li>
