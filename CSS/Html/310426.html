In Windows XP and later, Regedit.exe is the only Registry Editor tool that is included in the operating system. Regedt32.exe is no longer a part of Windows XP or Windows Server 2003. A primary use of Regedt32.exe that was missing from earlier versions of Regedit.exe , was to set permissions and other security settings for registry keys and subkeys. That feature is now available in the version of Regedit.exe that is included in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.<br><br><span class='text-base'>Note</span>: If you try to start the Regedt32.exe tool in the<br> <strong class='uiterm'>Run</strong> dialog box of Windows XP or Windows Server 2003, Regedit.exe starts, and Windows does not generate an error message.<br><br>  The version of Regedit.exe that is included in Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 includes the Permissions and Favorites features. The Favorites feature was first introduced in the Microsoft Windows 2000 version of Regedit.<br><br>  You can use the Favorites feature to put frequently-used registry subkeys on a list that is accessible on the <strong class='uiterm'>Favorites</strong> menu. To do so, click a subkey, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Add to Favorites</strong> on the<br> <strong class='uiterm'>Favorites</strong> menu, type a name for the Favorites listing or accept the default name. The default name is the name of the subkey. The listing is then available on the <strong class='uiterm'>Favorites</strong> menu, and you can click the listing to return to the subkey. To delete a listing, click it on the<br> <strong class='uiterm'>Favorites</strong> menu, click <strong class='uiterm'>Remove Favorite</strong>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>OK</strong> to confirm the deletion.<br><br> The security features that are available in Regedit.exe include assigning permissions, auditing access to the registry, and assigning ownership of a registry key.<br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='2'></a>Assigning Permissions to a Registry Key</h3><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click the key that you want to assign permissions.</li><li>On the <strong class='uiterm'>Edit</strong> menu, click<br><strong class='uiterm'>Permissions</strong>.</li><li>Click the group or user name that you want to work with.</li><li>Assign one of the following access levels to the key: <br><ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Select the <strong class='uiterm'>Allow</strong> check box for<br> <strong class='uiterm'>Read</strong> to give permission to read the key contents, but not save any changes.</li><li>Select the <strong class='uiterm'>Allow</strong> check box for<br> <strong class='uiterm'>Full Control</strong> to give permission to open, edit, and take ownership of the key.</li></ul></li><li>To grant special permission in the key, click<br><strong class='uiterm'>Advanced</strong>, and then double-click the user or group that you want to assign special access.
