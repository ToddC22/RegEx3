<header><h1>ASMS – Applying Credits and Refunds in CMAT</h1></header><p>Submit a <a href="http://sharepoint/sites/fastrack/Lists/ModTrack/NewForm.aspx?RootFolder=">ModTrack</a> request to update this TSG.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</strong></h3>

<p>This article explains how to process customer credits and refunds using the Commerce Management Agent Tool (CMAT). Read this article prior to applying any customer refunds or credits.</p>

<p>Charges/credits that are only available in CST will follow the same flows, but any credits above $5000 will need AEO approval, then ASMS can apply the credits/refunds in CST. There is no workflow approver like there is in CMAT presently.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Note: </strong>Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) credits and refunds are handled differently from the process laid out in this article. For directions on applying credits and refunds to CSP accounts, see the <strong>Cloud Solution Provider TSG</strong> (<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3078989" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 3078989</a>).</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Policy" name="Policy"></a>Policy</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li>ASMS Support Engineers (SEs) may apply credits or refunds to customer accounts for <strong>$1,000 or less (USD) per service request (SR)</strong>. Any requests above that will require approval as part of the approval workflow detailed in this document.</li>
	<li>All transactions are fully audited. There will be questions if you are outside of compliance.</li>
	<li>Credit request&nbsp;for AIRS subscriptions need to be reviewed by the Azure Internal Offer Team (formerly Azure Business Desk). Follow TSG&nbsp;<a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2927087" managed-link="" target="_blank">2927087</a>&nbsp;for guidance on how to engage this team.&nbsp;</li>

<h4><strong><a id="Getting Approval for a Customer’s Refund Request" name="Getting Approval for a Customer’s Refund Request"></a>Getting Approval for a Customer&rsquo;s Refund Request</strong></h4>

<ol>
	<li>If the credit/refund request is for <strong>$1,000 or less (USD)</strong>, skip to the <em><a bookmark-id="Processing a Customer’s Refund Request" href="#Processing a Customer’s Refund Request" managed-link="">Processing a Customer&rsquo;s Refund Request</a> </em>section<em>.</em></li>
	<li>If the credit/refund request is for <strong>$1,001 or more, but less than $2,500 (USD)</strong>, engage your Technical Advisor (TA), or <strong>$2,501 or more, but less than $5,000</strong>, engage your Manager&nbsp;for approval for the refund. If your TA or Manager approves the refund, work through the following process and select your TA/M1 as the approver for the refund in <u>Step 17 of the next section</u>.</li>
	<li>If the credit/refund request is for <strong>$5,000 or more (USD)</strong>, create a <span asset="4498193" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4498193]</span> in your case with all the customer&rsquo;s account details and <span>send the <span asset="4498193" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4498193]</span> to your respective <strong>TA/PTA POD</strong> queue, who would review and send it to the <strong>Azure Web Direct Escalations,</strong> or <strong>Azure in Open Escalations</strong> (for AiO subscriptions only) queue. If the request is approved, select the <span asset="4498193" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4498193]</span> owner as the approver in <u>Step 17 of the next section</u>.</span>&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Always check for open and ready balance before processing any credits or refunds to customer. Any credits or refunds processed will get adjusted with open and ready balance first and the remaining amount is what will be displayed under <strong>Charges</strong> section in CMAT.</li>
	<li>Always use the <em>Refund to Billing Account</em> (credits) option in CMAT (even if the customer has asked for a refund to their credit card).
	<ul>
		<li>After the credit is processed, you can manually push the refund to a credit card under the <em>Payments Instruments</em> tab using the <em>Process Balance&nbsp;</em>option.&nbsp;This will help PayOps in tracking the payments under a single Balance ID in the event the refund fails. If this option does not appear&nbsp;in the&nbsp;<em>Payment Instruments</em><span>&nbsp;tab, do the following:</span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Once the refund is processed and the balance is in the <em>Open </em>state, use the <em>Update</em>&nbsp;option to change the refund&#39;s due date to the next working day.</li>
			<li>The next day, the open balance will move to the <em>Requested&nbsp;</em>state with its type as <em>ScheduledSettle</em>. This means that the balance is still waiting to be adjusted and has not been pushed to the customer&#39;s&nbsp;card. In order to immediately push this balance to the credit card, navigate to the&nbsp;<em>Transactions&nbsp;</em><span>of the balance and process any one of the line items. Once processed, the balance type will change to <em>Refund</em>.</span>&nbsp;<em>Refund</em>&nbsp;type transactions will succeed or fail within a few hours.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>If there are 20 (or more) line items that need to be credited or refunded in CMAT, work with your TA/PTA on the request.&nbsp; The TA&#39;s/PTA&#39;s have the multiple line item credit/refund option in CMAT.&nbsp; The SE will need to get any approvals (if above empowerment level of the TA) from Azure Enterprise Operations prior to taking any actions in CMAT.

<h4><strong><a id="Processing a Customer’s Refund Request" name="Processing a Customer’s Refund Request"></a>Processing a Customer&rsquo;s Refund Request</strong></h4>

<p>If you are needing to process a refund or provide a credit to a customer, you can do so using the steps below:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open <a href="https://cmat.tools.cp.microsoft.com">CMAT</a>.</li>
	<li>Use one of the Customer Search options to locate your customer&rsquo;s Azure account.</li>
	<li>Click on the <span asset="4345389" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345389]</span> (right facing arrow) to the right of the line item with your customer&rsquo;s account information.<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> You may have to hover over the line item with your mouse to make the arrow appear.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Billing</strong>.</li>
	<li>Click <strong>Transactions</strong>.</li>
	<li>Select the line item that you want to refund to the customer and click on the <span asset="4345390" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345390]</span>&nbsp;(dropdown arrow) to the right of the line item.</li>
	<li>You should see the line item expand into a section resembling the following:<br>
	<span asset="4345391" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345391]</span></li>
	<li>Check to see if <em>Can Refund</em> is <strong>True</strong>, and <em>Refunded</em> is <strong>No</strong>. (See the red boxes below.)<span asset="4345392" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345392]</span>
	<ul>
		<li>If <em>Can Refund </em>is <em>False</em>, the transaction can&rsquo;t be refunded.</li>
		<li>If <em>Refunded</em> is <em>Yes</em>, it means that the transaction has already been partially or completely refunded.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Copy the <strong>LineItem ID</strong>, <strong>Subscription ID</strong>, and the <strong>Invoice ID</strong>. (See the blue boxes below.)<br>
	You will need them for <u>Step 15</u>.<br>
	<span asset="4345393" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345393]</span></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Refund Transaction</strong>. (See the orange box below.)<br>
	This will cause the <em>Refund Transaction</em> pane to appear.<br>
	<span asset="4345394" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345394]</span><br>
	<span asset="4345395" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4345395]</span></li>
	<li>In the <em>Refund Transaction</em> pane, enter the <strong>Refund Amount&nbsp;</strong>(if it&rsquo;s anything other than the full amount.)</li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Important: </strong>The amount that you are refunding must be positive. Entering a negative number will charge your customer that amount.</li>
	<li>The <em>Refund Amount</em> is generally the <strong>Pretax</strong> <strong>Amount</strong>. The <em>Tax Amount</em> will automatically be calculated for the refund and does not need to be added to the <em>Refund Amount</em>.
	<ul>
		<li>If you refund less than the <em>Pretax Amount</em>, explain why you did so in the <strong>Comments</strong> section.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>If the <em>Refunded</em> value in <u>Step 8</u> was <em>Yes</em>, then a partial or total refund has already been applied. If a partial refund has already been applied, you can only refund the amount that is remaining of the charge.</li>
</ul>

<ol start="12">
	<li>Select a refund reason code from the <strong>Reason </strong>dropdown.

	<ul>
		<li>These codes are explained in more detail in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-US/help/3045635" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 3045635</a>.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Select a refund option from the <strong>Refund Option </strong>dropdown.
	<ul>
		<li>For Invoice Pay customers:
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li>Select <strong>Refund to billing account</strong>. This will apply the credit to the customer&rsquo;s next invoice.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>For Credit Card customers (use one of the following options):
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li><strong>Option 1:</strong> To apply the refund as a <strong>credit</strong> to the customer&#39;s next Microsoft invoice, select <strong>Refund to billing account</strong>.<br>
			(Only use this option if the customer still has an active order on their account .)</li>
			<li><strong>Option 2:</strong> For credit card customers who want a <strong>refund</strong> to their credit card in 10 calendar days:
			<ol start="1">
				<li>Check the <em>Charges</em> page to see if the status of the charges to their credit card show as <em>Succeeded</em>. This means the charge to the credit card was successful and you can proceed with the refund.</li>
				<li>If the status of their charges shows as <em>Open</em> or <em>Failed</em>, this means their card has not yet been charged. Do not proceed with the refund.</li>
				<li>If charge status is <em>Succeeded</em>, select <strong>Refund to Payment Instrument immediately</strong> from the <em>Refund Option</em> dropdown.<br>
				<br>
				<strong>Note</strong>: Use <em>Refund to Payment Instrument immediately</em> for a cancelled subscription with no other active subscriptions on their account, or if the customer still has active subscriptions on their account but is unhappy and wants a refund to their credit card instead of a credit on their next invoice.</li>
			</ol>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<ol start="14">
	<li>Select the approval needed from the <strong>Approval </strong>dropdown.

	<ul>
		<li>If you are within your empowerment level (For Support Engineers, this is $1,000 USD <strong>per SR</strong>), select<strong> Not Required</strong>.</li>
		<li>If the total of the lines items on the same SR you will be refunding will be greater than $1,001 USD, select <strong>Required</strong>. You will need to select your request approvers on the following screen.</li>
		<li>If you are outside of your empowerment level on the line item itself, the approval option will be pre-set to <strong>Required</strong>. You will need to select your request approvers on the following screen.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Enter the following into the <em>Comments </em>section:<br>
	&lt;<em>Your Microsoft Alias</em>&gt; - &lt;<em>Subscription ID</em>&gt; - &lt;<em>Invoice ID</em>&gt; - &lt;<em>LineItem ID</em>&gt; - &lt;<em>Additional information, such as reason justification or other useful information.</em>&gt;<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Note: </strong>If you get an error in CMAT due to the <em>LineItem ID</em> looking like a credit card number, you can remove the <em>LineItem ID </em>from the <em>Comments</em>.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>right arrow</strong> <strong>button</strong>.</li>
	<li>If you selected <strong>Approval: Required</strong>, you will be prompted to select approvers for your transaction.<br>
	Select your approvers based on your selections in the <em><a bookmark-id="Getting Approval for a Customer’s Refund Request" href="#Getting Approval for a Customer’s Refund Request" managed-link="">Getting Approval for a Customer&rsquo;s Refund Request</a> </em> section.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Do <strong>not</strong> check <em>All approvers</em>.</li>
	<li>Enter the <strong>Service Request Number</strong> from your case into the <em>Service Request Number</em> field.</li>
	<li>Click the <strong>check mark button</strong> to complete the credit/refund transaction. You will see a new line item noting your credit/refund when you return to the <em>Transactions</em> page.</li>
	<li>Inform your customer that it will take 7 &ndash; 10 business days for them to receive their refund or credit.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important: </strong>If your transaction required an approval, note that approval requests are only active for 7 days. If they are not approved within that window, this process must be restarted. (See the <a bookmark-id="Checking the Approval Request Status" href="#Checking the Approval Request Status" managed-link=""><em>Checking the Approval Request Status</em></a> section for information on checking the status of your approvals.)</p>

<ul>
	<li>Be sure to let the customer know how they can verify that a credit or refund has been processed.</li>
	<li>If a refund to a credit card was processed, let them know it can take up to 10 business days to appear.</li>
	<li>They will see the credit/refund under <strong>Adjustments</strong> in their next invoice, which may take up to 30 days to be generated.<br>
	<br>
	&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong><a id="Checking the Approval Request Status" name="Checking the Approval Request Status"></a>Checking the Approval Request Status</strong></h4>

<p>If you want to see the status of your Requests, you can click the <strong>Requests</strong> tab in CMAT. (See screenshot below.)<br>

<p>If you make a mistake applying a credit to an account, you can reverse the credit in CMAT yourself. To do so:</p>

<ol class="indent-3">
	<li>Verify the line item to be reversed displays a negative amount.<br>
	(If the amount to be reversed is positive, you can process it as a normal credit.)<br>
	<strong>Note:</strong> Reversals can only be completed on a line by line basis. Do not combine lines into a single refund.<br>
	<strong>Secondary Note:</strong> If in doubt about how to reverse your credit, engage your TA for assistance.<br>
