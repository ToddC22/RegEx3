<p><span><span><span><span>&#8203;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>Hi,</span></span></span></span><br>
<span><span><span><span><br>
My name is <strong>[Advocate&rsquo;s First Name]</strong> with Microsoft Customer Support. I understand that a situation like this one can be difficult, and I appreciate your patience while I performed an investigation of your account. I am contacting you today to provide the results of my investigation. </span></span></span></span><br>
<span><span><span><span><br>
Account security is a top priority at Microsoft and our <span>Advanced Capability </span></span></span></span><span> </span><span><span><span>Advocates is dedicated to investigating and validating fraudulent activity. The account and billing activity associated with your Microsoft Account was thoroughly reviewed by our fraud team and I can confirm your account was compromised. I&rsquo;ve taken the appropriate measures to secure your account. Please see the information below for steps to regain control of your Microsoft account. </span></span></span></span><span><strong><span></span></strong></span><br>
<span><strong><span><span><span><br>
(OPTION 1)</span></span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><span><br>
The investigation revealed that purchases were made while your account was out of your control. I&rsquo;ve refunded <strong>[INSERT REFUND AMOUNT]</strong> to your payment method(s) and added <strong>[INSERT CSV AMOUNT]</strong> to your local currency balance. Generally, refunds are received within 7 days but may take up to 30 days depending on your financial institution&rsquo;s individual policies. Please note that if there are any outstanding balances on your account, the amount of the balance will be deducted from the refund. If you&rsquo;d like to review the transaction activity on your account, please visit </span></span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://account.microsoft.com%20" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com </a></span></span></span><span><span><span>and sign into your Xbox Live account for a detailed view of your charges and refunds.</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><br>
OR</span></span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
(OPTION 2)</span></span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><span><br>
The investigation revealed that no purchases were made while your account was out of your control. </span></span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
(Delete this item if No gamertag change occurred.)</span></span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><span><br>
Per my investigation, your gamertag was changed while the account was out of your control. As a result, your account has been granted a one-time free gamertag change. You can change your gamertag back to what it was or something else of your choosing. Please be aware that once you change your gamertag you will have to pay if you want to change it again. Choose wisely.</span></span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
Please take the following steps to regain control of your Microsoft account:</span></span></span></strong></span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
Step 1: Reset your Microsoft account password&#8203;</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Check your email in the next 24 hours for a password recovery email from the Microsoft Account Team. </span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>&#8203;Note: If the reset link expires or you can&rsquo;t find the password recovery email, go to </span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://account.microsoft.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://account.microsoft.com</a></span></span></span><span><span>, type in your Microsoft account, and then click </span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://login.live.com/resetpw.srf?wreply=https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa%3dwsignin1.0%26rpsnv%3d11%26ct%3d1350063919%26rver%3d6.1.6206.0%26wp%3dSAPI%26wreply%3dhttps:%252F%252Faccount.live.com%252Fsummarypage.aspx%26id%3d38936%26vv%3d1350%26mkt%3dEN-US%26lc%3d1033&amp;id=38936&amp;mkt=EN-US&amp;lc=1033&amp;bk=1350063919&amp;username=" managed-link="" target="_blank">Can&#39;t access your account?</a></span></span></span><span><span> Or, respond to this email, and we&rsquo;ll send the password recovery email again.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Use the link in the email to reset your Microsoft account password. The stronger you make your password, the better. For tips on creating strong passwords, see </span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026406/microsoft-account-create-a-strong-password" managed-link="" target="_blank">Create strong passwords</a></span></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Update the </span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://account.live.com/proofs/manage" managed-link="" target="_blank">security information</a></span></span></span><span><span> for your Microsoft account. We <em>strongly</em> suggest that you not skip this step because it will help you protect your account from possible future attacks. Your security information may include alternative email address, secret question, cell phone number, and trusted PC.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Step 2: Delete your Xbox Live Profile</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
Now that you&#39;ve reset your password, you will need to delete your profile from the console and redownload it with your new credentials. To do this, please perform the following steps: </span></span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>

</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Step 3: Download your Xbox Live profile on your console</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Download Profile</strong>. Note: Not seeing Download Profile? This means that you&#39;re signed in under another profile. Press the X button on your controller to sign out, and then select Download Profile. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>At the bottom of the Download Profile screen, select <strong>Download Profile</strong>. Enter your Microsoft account and password when prompted. </span></span></span></span></span></li>

</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Step 4: Set your Xbox One home console</span></span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><span><br>
Complete the following steps on your Xbox One console:</span></span></span></span></p>

Hi, </span></span></span></span><br>
<span><span><span><span><br>
My name is <strong>[Advocate&rsquo;s First Name]</strong> with Microsoft Customer Support. I understand that a situation like this one can be difficult, and I appreciate your patience while I performed a thorough investigation of your account. I&rsquo;m contacting you today to provide the results of my investigation. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><br>
<br>
Account security is a top priority at Microsoft and we have a team dedicated to investigating and validating fraudulent activity. The account and billing activity associated with your Microsoft Account was thoroughly reviewed and I can confirm your account was compromised. At this time, I&rsquo;ve taken the appropriate measures to secure your account. Please see the information below for steps to regain control of your Microsoft account. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span></span></span><span><span><span><span>To recover your profile, I had to re-associate your gamertag to the available Microsoft account you provided during your investigation: <strong>[insert new Microsoft account]</strong>. Your gamertag, achievements, gamerscore, any downloadable content that you&#39;ve purchased and any currency that is on your account remains the same. The only thing that will change is the email address that you use to sign in to your account. You will need to use <strong>[insert new Microsoft Account] </strong>when logging in to your Xbox Live profile.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The change that has been made to your account can sometimes take up to 24 hours to fully complete in our system and, so you may encounter issues with your subscriptions. This is a temporary error but if you continue to have problems after 24 hours, please respond to this email and let me know. Additionally, this change may affect your achievements. If you notice that your achievements are not syncing correctly, please log into the impacted games and update the Microsoft account. This should resolve the issue.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>(OPTION 1)</span></span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><span><br>
The investigation revealed that purchases were made while your account was out of your control. I&rsquo;ve refunded <strong>[INSERT REFUND AMOUNT]</strong> to your payment method(s) and added <strong>[INSERT CSV AMOUNT]</strong> to your local currency balance. Generally, refunds are received within 7 days but may take up to 30 days depending on your financial institution&rsquo;s individual policies. Please note that if there are any outstanding balances on your account, the amount of the balance will be deducted from the refund. If you would like to review the transaction activity on your account, please visit </span></span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://commerce.microsoft.com </a></span></span></span><span><span><span>and sign into your Xbox Live account for a detailed view of your charges and refunds.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>OR</span></span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><span><br>
(OPTION 2)</span></span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><span><br>
The investigation revealed that no purchases were made while your account was out of your control. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>(Delete this item if No GT change occurred.)</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Per my investigation, your gamertag was changed while the account was out of your control. As a result, your account has been granted a one-time free gamertag change. You can change your gamertag back to what it was or something else of your choosing. Please be aware that once you change your gamertag you will have to pay if you want to change it again.

Service Request <strong>[XXXXXXXXX]</strong><br>
Gamertag: <strong>[INSERT]</strong><br>
Microsoft account: <strong>[INSERT]</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Hi, </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>My name is <strong>[Advocate&rsquo;s First Name]</strong> with Microsoft Customer Support. I understand that a situation like this one can be difficult, and I appreciate your patience while I performed an investigation of your account.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Account security is a top priority at Microsoft and we have a team dedicated to investigating and validating fraudulent activity. The account and billing activity associated with your Microsoft account was thoroughly reviewed by our Advanced Capability Advocates and I can confirm there was unauthorized access. I can also see that you have regained control of your account, so we will take no further action to secure the account at this time. My investigation revealed that <strong>[purchases / no purchases]</strong> were made while your account was out of your control. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>(Account Purchases)</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
The total amount of purchases made while the account was out of your control is <strong>[insert amount of refund]</strong>, and I&rsquo;ve issued a full refund to the payment method that was used to make the purchases. Generally, refunds will be received within 7 days but may take up to 30 days, depending on your financial institution. Please note that if there are any outstanding balances on your account, the amount of the balance will be deducted from the refund. In addition, I&rsquo;ve added <strong>[insert CSV amount]</strong> to your Microsoft account balance. This balance is immediately available to you.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>(GT Change)</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
My investigation shows that your gamertag was changed while the account was out of your control. I&rsquo;ve enabled you to change your gamertag for free. To do this, please visit the </span></span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://support.xbox.com/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/change-xbox-live-gamertag" managed-link="" target="_blank">How to change your Xbox gamertag</a></span></span></span><span><span><span> page for instructions to change your gamertag.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> After you confirm your new gamertag, the change is reflected across Xbox. You don&#39;t need to tell your friends that you&#39;ve changed your gamertag&mdash;their Friends lists will be updated automatically.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>To fully regain control of your Microsoft account, please complete the following steps:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Step 1: Update the security information on your Microsoft account.</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
Please do not skip this step, as this will help protect your account from potential attackers. </span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Sign in with your Microsoft account </span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://account.live.com/proofs/Manage" managed-link="" target="_blank">here</a></span></span></span></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Click on <strong>Manage advanced security</strong> under the <strong>Security </strong>heading. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Under Update your security info select <strong>Update Info</strong>. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>You may be asked to verify that you are the account owner by receiving a security code via text or email and then entering it online. <em>Verify your identity</em> by following the prompts to access the Security Settings page. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Add Security Info</strong> and we <em>strongly encourage</em> you to include both an email address and a phone number, in case you lose access to one or the other.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Step 2: Delete your Xbox Live Profile</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
Now that you&#39;ve secured your account, you will need to delete your profile from the console and redownload it with your new credentials. To do this, please perform the following steps: </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Xbox One Console:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Press the <strong>Menu</strong> button.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>All Settings.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select the account that you want to remove. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Remove from this Xbox.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Once the account has been removed the system will return to the main menu.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Xbox 360 Console:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong> and select <strong>System</strong>. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Storage</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Navigate to <strong>Storage</strong> and select <strong>Storage Device</strong>. </span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span> if you don&#39;t connect any external storage devices to your console, select Hard Drive.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Navigate to <strong>Profiles</strong> then select the profile that you want to remove. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Delete</strong> to remove and <strong>Close</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Step 3: Download your Xbox Live profile</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
For your security I&rsquo;ve removed access to your profile from all consoles it was associated to. You must now re-download your profile. Complete the following steps on your console:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Xbox One Console:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Add new.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Enter the email address for the Microsoft account, and then select <strong>Enter</strong>. <strong>Important</strong> Make sure that you do <strong>not</strong> select <strong>Get a new account</strong> unless that&#39;s what you want to do. If you select this, you will create a brand-new Microsoft account.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Enter the password for your Microsoft account, and then select <strong>Enter</strong>. If you&#39;ve forgotten your password, select <strong>I forgot my password.</strong></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Read the Microsoft Service Agreement and Privacy Statement, and then select <strong>I Accept</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Follow the steps to configure your <strong>Sign-In &amp; Security </strong>preferences to add your Microsoft account to your Xbox One console.</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span>Hi, </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>My name is <strong>[Advocate&rsquo;s First Name]</strong> with Microsoft Customer Support. I want to thank you for taking the time to contact us regarding your account takeover claim. I understand that a situation like this can be difficult and I appreciate your patience during this investigation.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>I&rsquo;m happy to report that your account is secure and has not been compromised. During my investigation, I was able to confirm that all activity for the purchases in question originated from the Xbox and/or location primarily associated with your gamertag and Microsoft account. Please understand that account security is a top priority at Microsoft and a thorough investigation has been performed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Although my investigation yielded no evidence of an account takeover, I understand that these charges were unexpected, and I do have the ability to provide a refund for you. I&rsquo;ve processed a refund in the amount of <strong>&lt;Amount&gt; </strong>for all unauthorized purchases made between <strong>&lt;Date&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;Date&gt;</strong> to the payment method that was used to make the purchases. Generally, refunds are received within 7 days but may take up to 30 days depending on your financial institution&rsquo;s individual policies. Please note that if there are any outstanding balances on your account, the amount of the balance will be deducted from the refund.

<p><span><span><span><span>As my investigation shows that your account was not compromised and the purchases in dispute originated from your primary device, this is a one-time exception. To ensure that you don&rsquo;t incur any additional charges, I&rsquo;ve removed your payment method(s) from the account. I understand the frustration that can be involved with this specific issue and would like to provide you with resources that have been built into the Xbox Live service that can help further prevent unnecessary purchases by family members or friends in the future:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Once you&#39;ve created and verified the account, please <strong>do not log in to any Microsoft services such as Xbox.com</strong>, as doing so will create a new gamertag for you, and we&#39;ll have to start over. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>After you have completed the process above, reply to this email with your new Microsoft account email address that you have just created. Please do not include any additional account information in your response. Once I receive your new Microsoft account email address, I can then associate it with your original gamertag. This will allow you to recover your account as requested. </span></span></span></span></p>
