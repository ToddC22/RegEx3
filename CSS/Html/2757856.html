			<p><strong>Software and downloads<a id="SoftwareDownloads" name="SoftwareDownloads"></a></strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Advertisers, publishers, and partners must ensure a positive download experience for users. This includes, at a minimum, clearly identifying the software that is being installed and its source, explaining the effects on the user&rsquo;s browser settings, or operating system and its settings, etc., and allowing easy uninstall and disablement. Use the policies on this page for help.</span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>In addition to compliance with these policies, we also require compliance with the </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/objectivecriteria.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Malware Protection Center policies</a><span><span> and adherence to prevalent industry guidelines and best practices. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><br>
			<strong>Malicious and unwanted software</strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Microsoft does not allow the promotion and distribution of either Malicious Software or Unwanted Software.</span></span></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><strong><span><span>Malicious Software</span></span></strong><span><span> is software which performs malicious actions on the user&rsquo;s device, such as compromising personal and financial information or security protocols. Malicious Software includes (but is not limited to) trojan, worms, ransomware, trojanclicker, trojanspy, backdoor trojan, exploit, macro virus, virtool, dropper, rogue security software, password stealer, obfuscator, hacktool, virus, spyware (including recording actions performed on the user&#39;s device such as keystroke logging), and scareware.<br>
				<br>
				Microsoft utilizes a series of signals and classifications to determine whether software meets the definition of Malicious Software.</span></span></span><br>
				&nbsp;</li>
				<li><span><strong><span><span>Unwanted Software</span></span></strong><span><span> includes software that does not expressly fall under the definition of Malicious Software, but still includes functionality which limits or denies users&rsquo; choice and control on the experience on their own devices or may otherwise compromise user computing experience and/or the performance of the user&rsquo;s device, browser, operating system, or even publisher properties.<br>
				<br>
				In determining whether software is &ldquo;Unwanted Software,&rdquo; we apply the criteria listed below. We also consider the </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/mmpc/shared/objectivecriteria.aspx" target="_blank">Microsoft Malware Protection Center policies</a><span><span>, other Microsoft product requirements (such as Windows), industry guidelines, and best practices. </span></span></span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>User choice and control</strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Users must be provided with adequate choice and control both before, during, and after installation. Software which does not provide adequate choice and/or control is not allowed within the Microsoft Advertising network. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span><strong>Choice</strong> ensures that users are fully informed about how software may affect their experience on their devices, and that none of the functions of a program or settings on the device are altered without the user&rsquo;s clear and informed consent. </span></span></span></p>

			<p><span><span><span>User notice must be clear, informed, unequivocal and not coerced or otherwise obtained through misleading claims, false representations, or other fraudulent means. In determining whether disclosures to users are acceptable, we will consider the totality of the experience on both the offer and the landing page and/or offer screen from the point of view of an average consumer. Material terms cannot appear only within the End User License Agreement (EULA), but must be prominently displayed up front (that is, what an average user can read and understand) and must not be misleading or hidden (for example only under the &ldquo;Custom Install&rdquo; option). </span></span></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong><span><span><span>Disclosures</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> enable users to exercise choice. All relevant and material information must be clearly and prominently disclosed up front to end users on the landing page, offer screen or store listing (as relevant) before installation. This includes, but is not limited to:</span></span></span>

				<ul>
					<li><span><span><span>Origin and scope of the download, including if the download originates from a different domain.</span></span></span></li>
					<li><span><span><span>All software that is included in the download. This includes each product name, source, key features and functionalities, and a link to the privacy policy and EULA (which shall include contact information). </span></span></span></li>
					<li><span><span><span>Actions and effects that the software will have on the user&rsquo;s device and settings, including changes to the search providers, autocomplete, homepages, local file systems and other configurations and user&#39;s settings. </span></span></span></li>
					<li><span><span><span>Alteration of existing software on the user&#39;s device.</span></span></span></li>
					<li><span><span><span>Any variations from the official software.</span></span></span></li>
					<li><span><span><span>Software uninstall information that includes instructions on reverting back settings that the software changes.</span></span></span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><span><strong><span><span>Offer screens</span></span></strong><span><span> must clearly disclose and identify to users all software included in the offer (including appropriate branding/logo usage).</span></span></span>
				<ul>
					<li><span><span><span>The name of the software on the offer screen must match the name of the software as stored on the user device and uninstall dialogs. In other words, users must be able to clearly locate the software on their devices based on the original name presented in the offer screen at installation. </span></span></span></li>
					<li><span><span><span>Add/remove details must be accurate (for example, install date must match the date of the program installation).</span></span></span></li>
					<li><span><span><span>Offer screens must be presented to the user as either opt-in or opt-out. </span></span></span></li>
					<li><span><span><span>Users must be able to decline all secondary offers, individually or in bulk (&ldquo;Skip All&rdquo;).</span></span></span>
					<ul>
						<li><span><span><span>Accept and Decline options must be of equal prominence.</span></span></span></li>
						<li><span><span><span>Repeat declines are disallowed. As users decline any or all secondary offers, the offer screen must not prompt users to decline the same offer(s) more than once. </span></span></span></li>
					</ul>
					</li>
					<li><span><span><span>Offer screens must clearly disclose to the users any changes to the settings, existing software, and applications. <span><span><span>For example, modifications to the search provider, homepage and/or new tab must be clearly disclosed to the user. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p><span><span><span><strong>Control</strong> ensures that users are in full control of the overall experience on their device, including all software applications they download. Users must be in control at all times, including if and when they elect to revert back to previous settings or uninstall or disable any previously installed software. </span></span></span></p>

			<p>Disallowed behaviors</p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span><span>Software must not include Malicious or Unwanted Software.</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software must not create any unexpected behaviors. The software must behave consistently with the declared behavior and functionalities at install. </span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software must not perform activities that are hidden to the user or otherwise attempt to hide its presence or operation on the device, unless for legitimate background processes (which would be disclosed to users at install). For clarity, this does not include activities that would normally be expected to be hidden as part of regular product functionality, such as calculations. </span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software must not be designed to evade, circumvent or impair security checks, antimalware, operating system and browser security scans and protection, or spam filters.</span></span></span>
				<ul>
					<li><span><span><span>Cloaking behaviors or technology, or any behaviors meant to elude scans or<strong> </strong>detection, is not allowed. The software must not behave differently in a virtual environment or otherwise attempt to elude browser protection<strong>, </strong>anti-malware detection or fraud filtering. </span></span></span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><span><span><span>Downloads must not alter, reconfigure, or disable existing software or settings installed on the user&rsquo;s device without clear disclosure and consent from the user before the install.</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software must not inhibit or otherwise limit the user&rsquo;s ability to control and change settings on the device. </span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software that automatically dials a phone number, or connects remotely to another device or system without legitimate reasons and/or user consent is not allowed.</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Alerts or other technologies must not attempt to mislead users into believing something is wrong with their device that needs fixing when this is not the case (e.g., scareware), or otherwise misrepresent or make exaggerated claims about system&rsquo;s health and performance (for example by claiming that the system performance will improve by removing files that do not positively<strong> </strong>affect system performance).</span></span></span>
				<ul>
					<li><span><span><span>PC cleaner/optimization software </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/mmpc/2016/02/24/cleaners-ought-to-be-clean-and-clear/" target="_blank">should provide error details</a><span><span> to further specify their claims, as opposed to merely stating the presence of a certain number of issues. </span></span></span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><span><span><span>Free downloads must not be made conditional to any forms of consideration, including a sign up or the provision of a cellular phone number (except in the event where sign up/account creation needs to be validated by the user, such as an email account creation validated via text message, or a required app store account creation for example).</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software must not weaken or attempt to compromise the security and/or protection of the user device or attempt to disclose any of the personal or sensitive information of the end user. </span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software may not replace, add to, or remove from the web page by injecting content, or causing site content not to display, from a source with which the site owner does not have an affiliation.</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software must not limit the user&rsquo;s control or programmatic control of the user&rsquo;s browser default search settings, home page and new tab, either through additional questioning/prompts or other means of prevention when a change to the default search, home page or new tab settings is attempted.</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Unsigned software is not allowed. All software must be digitally signed by its author(s) using a valid certificate issued by a reputable certification authority. </span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Unauthorized distribution is not allowed. Advertisers and partners may only distribute software which they are authorized to distribute. Please review our </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/misleading-content-policies" target="_blank">Misleading Content Policy</a><span><span> to learn more about promotion of third-party products and services. </span></span></span>
				<ul>
					<li><span><span><span>Free desktop software in particular is subject to heightened controls, which may require actual proof of authorized distribution from the software publisher. </span></span></span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software that changes browsing experience must adhere to the browser&rsquo;s and/or operating system&rsquo;s respective supported extensibility models and policies. For example, software may not suppress or otherwise circumvent browser consent dialogs.</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Users must be able to abort software installation prior to completion through a standard &ldquo;close&rdquo; button. Aborted installations must be complete, in that no traces of the software remain on the device (including discarding of any selections made prior to abort). </span></span></span>
				<ul>
					<li><span><span><span>Installation programs may only present one single dialog prompt confirming user intent to abort in clear, straightforward language.</span></span></span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li><span><span><span>If a user declines an offer, or cancels the install before the installation process is completed, software may not place any shortcuts on the user&rsquo;s device to continue the installation at a later time. </span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Changes to user&rsquo;s device and settings, including changes to the search providers, homepages, local file systems and other configurations and user&#39;s settings must be easily reversible without negative impact.</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Undisclosed files that are unnecessary or unrelated to the software being installed must not be installed or delivered.</span></span></span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><br>
			<strong>Update functionality</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span><span>Updates must not be triggered without user consent, with the exception of enterprise products background updates (disclosed at install). Users may agree to automatic updates during installation via prominent consent language (for example, check box on the offer screen).</span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Update dialogs must clearly disclose what is being updated. </span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>Software updates must not materially alter the original function of the software disclosed at install without the user consent and control. </span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span>A software update must not alter third-party software without user consent.</span></span></span>
				<ul>
					<li><span><span><span>For clarity, this does not include antimalware software signature updates that enable the detection of third-party software for user protection purposes; an updated antimalware product is allowed to detect third party software as a result of its updates.</span></span></span></li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Uninstall functionality</strong></p>

			<p><span><span><span>Any software download must include an uninstall function in the Programs and Features or Add/Remove Programs control panel, or the browser&rsquo;s or operating system&rsquo;s default removal method. </span></span></span></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span><span><span>The uninstall process must not be difficult, confusing or made conditional to payments, subscriptions, other downloads, etc. </span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Upon uninstall, a program may only display one single confirmation prompt. The confirmation prompt cannot be misleading or otherwise attempting to persuade the user not to proceed with the uninstall. </span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>During uninstall, software may not install, uninstall or reinstall other unrelated software on the device without user consent. </span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>The uninstall process must be complete and permanent for each software download. No traces of the specific uninstalled software can remain on the user&rsquo;s device.</span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><strong>Bundling functionality</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span><span><span>All software that is included in the download bundle must be clearly disclosed to the user.</span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>The software or bundles must not be altered from what was disclosed to the end user or after review by Microsoft (for example, by injecting code into the bundle). </span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>End users must be allowed to easily decline each individual software within the bundle, either individually or through a &ldquo;skip all.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Installer and bundles must not crash or freeze programs or the device.</span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Chained bundlers (bundle within a bundle) are not allowed.</span></span></span></span></li>
				<li><span><span><span><span>Legitimate software cannot be bundled with other software that is not allowed by this policy. For example, an otherwise &lsquo;complaint&rsquo; software cannot be bundled with spyware. </span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>

			<p><br>
			<strong>Additional requirements for advertisements</strong></p>

			<ul>
				<li><span><span><span>Software should be available on the website as advertised in ad copy. </span></span></span>

Q:</strong>&nbsp;<strong><span><span><span>Do we allow third-party technical support providers to advertise email support?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span>In instances where the advertisers are charging a fee to help set up webmail (such as Yahoo Mail, AOL, Hotmail/live/outlook.com and Gmail), email support is not allowed to be promoted. We do allow advertisers to offer support to help set up email clients/programs and servers, provided that the service offered is not something that only the product owner could provide, such as password reset or server issues, or that may require remote connectivity with the user&rsquo;s device*. In these circumstances, the advertiser must ensure that they have a prominent disclosure on the landing page, close to the call to action and not buried in the terms of service, obfuscated or in very small font for instance, that calls out that they are not the brand owner and the service is available from the brand owner.</span></span></span></p>

<strong>Q:&nbsp;What disclosures are needed on the page?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span>Advertisers providing support for third-party products must make clear their affiliation with the product or service and disclose that support is available by the brand owner, if applicable. Additionally, users should be able to find contact information for the company offering support within the site. <strong>The disclosure must be clear, prominent, within close proximity to the first call to action and complete. </strong>For example, an incomplete disclaimer with a <strong><em>Read More...</em></strong> link for a more complete disclaimer is <strong>disapproved</strong>.</span></span></span></p>

Q:&nbsp;Does the disclaimer have to be above the fold?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>No, but it does have to be in close visible proximity to the first visible call to action on the landing page. For example, a disclaimer right next to the phone number directing users to the third-party provider&rsquo;s call center. The disclaimer has to be in text on the landing page. It cannot be a link to another landing page.<br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q4" name="S1Q4"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;Do we require free shipping offers in ad copy to be visible on the landing page? </strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span>No. Free shipping offers are not always visible on the landing page, but are often presented or confirmed during the check-out process. Free shipping offers may also be conditional on a minimum purchase. This makes enforcement challenging without going through the check-out process and is considered low risk. We will adhere to a notice and take down enforcement approach. Manual enforcement is not required.</span></span></span><br>

<strong><a id="S1Q5" name="S1Q5"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;<span><span><span>Do we require any conditions to the free shipping offer to be disclosed in the ad copy?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>No, free shipping offers may be conditional on a minimum purchase or other requirement. Due to limited character space in ad copy and the low risk nature of this content, we will adhere to a notice and take down enforcement approach. Manual enforcement is not required.<br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q6" name="S1Q6"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;Is it acceptable for an advertiser promoting a third-party product to mirror the overall look and feel of the official brand or site on their own landing page?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span>No. Third-party advertisers may not mirror the overall look and feel of the official brand or site on their own landing page. Disallowed elements can include, individually or in any combination: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Logos </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Trademarks </span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span>Colors</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>The advertiser&rsquo;s site (and ad copy) has to make reasonably clear that it is not the official brand or site and must not show any intent to mislead the users. See below for non-compliant example. </span></span></span></p>

Q:&nbsp;Is it acceptable for an advertiser promoting a third-party product on their own landing page to have certain sections, devoted to a specific product or service, that is similar in look and feel to the official brand or site?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>Yes, but only in circumstances where the third-party advertiser&rsquo;s own brand has prevalence on the landing page over the sub-section of the landing page that is similar to the official brand or site.

<p><strong><a id="S1Q10" name="S1Q10"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;What does Microsoft Advertising do with the data collected through Universal Event Tracking?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span>At Microsoft Advertising, we know the importance and sensitivity of an advertiser&rsquo;s data. Thus, we ensure that the data we collect is clearly communicated to our advertisers and is also used in limited ways.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The data collected through Universal Event Tracking is used to report back to advertisers on campaign performance (e.g. conversion activities) and on engagement metrics (e.g. bounce rates, visits, duration per visit). Campaign performance data and engagement metrics will appear in your reports to help you make better decisions. The reports will be made available only through your Microsoft Advertising account.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The data collected through Universal Event Tracking may be used in aggregate by Microsoft for the benefit of all advertisers. Microsoft Advertising may use the data to help inform the ranking and relevance of ads within the marketplace. We also may use the data to help detect fraudulent activity.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>It is our policy to restrict access to this data, both inside and outside Microsoft Advertising. We do not share data tracked through Universal Event Tracking with other advertisers. For additional information on data usage, please refer to section labeled DATA USE in the </span></span></span><span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://bingads.microsoft.com/TC.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Advertising Agreement</a></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q11" name="S1Q11"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;For the lack of privacy policy on a site that is not collecting personal data, how are we enforcing?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>The enforcement is the same as before the policy change, we will only manually enforce if the site collects personal data.<br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q12" name="S1Q12"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;For third-party tech support advertisers that do not qualify for bypasses, what external message can we share with them?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><em>&ldquo;Unfortunately, we cannot overturn any of the rejections for several reasons. Per our User Safety &amp; Privacy policy, advertisers must be accurate when describing their relationship with the owner of a product or service (for example if they are authorized distributors). Additionally, as noted in our Relevance and Quality policy, navigational, popular, trending or branded queries may be subject to a higher standard of relevancy, which is resulting in reduced impressions for some of your ads. Given Microsoft&rsquo;s strategic efforts related to user safety we are unable to appeal these decisions at this time. We will continue to reassess this marketplace and appreciate your understanding.&rdquo;</em><br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q13" name="S1Q13"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;Do we allow the use of <em>gov</em> in ad copy?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>The use of <strong><em>gov</em></strong> in ad copy is disallowed if the purpose is to claim an association with government programs when none exists or to mislead. However, in the circumstance that it is not to mislead, they are OK &ndash; for example, if it is used as a reference: <strong><em>see the landmark gov building</em></strong>, <strong><em>find a job in the gov</em></strong>.<br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q14" name="S1Q14"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;For misleading ads, what about time-specific promotions, where the offer is not present on the site at the time the ad is submitted?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>Due to short-term promotions, some clients will submit ads with offers not yet reflected on their sites. We expect the advertiser to have their site content updated by the time the ad is live. For this reason, ads with offers conforming to our policies should not be rejected during initial editorial review even though the offers in the ad description and on the landing page may differ. For example:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Free shipping</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Free gift with purchase</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Free credit points/gift card with purchase</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>% discount, even though landing page may show different %</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Enforcement is based on complaint/ad pull process handled by L3</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This only applies to ads that are not live.<br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q15" name="S1Q15"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;What sites offering government services are acceptable?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A: </strong><span><span><span><span>Only <span>official government agencies may advertise government products and services.</span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a id="S1Q16" name="S1Q16"></a><br>
<strong>Q:&nbsp;For special offers, what are some examples of verbiage that is allowed?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span><span>The following are examples of what is allowed:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Descriptions that include pricing or discount language, offers of gifts or rewards, or special shipping terms (for example, free shipping) provided they are accurate and clearly visible on the landing page.</span></span></span> </span></span>

	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Example: &quot;Get cable hooked up for as low as $9.95 per month&quot;</span></span> </span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Example: &ldquo;Free shipping&rdquo; </span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Example: &ldquo;Get 20% off or more&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The purchasing of keywords specific to price point (for example, &lsquo;cheap&rsquo; or &lsquo;low cost&rsquo;) does not necessarily constitute a claim to content at that price point. No substantiation is required for superlatives or comparatives used as <em>keywords</em> to trigger display <em>of</em> ads.</span></span></span> </span></span>
	<ul>
		<li>Example: An advertiser may purchase keywords such as: &lsquo;best offer&rsquo; or &lsquo;cheapest holidays&rsquo; even where the site does not have this substantiated by an independent third party.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><a id="S1Q17" name="S1Q17"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;For unsubstantiated claims, how are we applying policy?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span>Advertising that includes unproven claims or endorsements is not allowed. For example, advertisers asserting an affiliation with or claiming to be &lsquo;sponsored by&rsquo; Microsoft or Yahoo! where no relationship exists (or simply as a &lt;NAME&gt; customer), whether the claim of affiliate is on the landing page or in the ad copy. Some examples:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If an advertiser claims to have &lsquo;Official FIFA World Cup merchandise&rsquo;</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If an ad claims that the advertising organization is accredited by a certification program, for example &lsquo;Microsoft Certified&rsquo; IT products</span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span>If we are informed by a relevant organization or we know that these claims are not true we may reject the ad for <strong>Unsubstantiated Claims.</strong></span></span> </span><br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q18" name="S1Q18"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;What is personal data (PII, personally identifiable information)?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong><span><span><span><span>Personal data is any piece of information that can potentially be used to uniquely identify, contact, or locate a single person. Items which might be considered as such include, but are not limited to:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Full name (if not common)</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>National identification number or social security number</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Telephone number</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Street address</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Email address</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>IP address (in some cases)</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Vehicle registration plate number</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Driver&#39;s license number</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Face, fingerprints, or handwriting</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Credit card numbers</span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Digital identity</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>Information that is not generally considered personally identifiable, because many people share the same trait, include:</span></span></span> </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>First or last name, if common</span></span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Country, state, or city of residence</span></span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Age, especially if non-specific</span></span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Gender or race</span></span></span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Name of the school they attend or workplace</span></span></span> </span></span></li>

<p><strong><a id="S1Q19" name="S1Q19"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;How do we handle bypass requests from advertisers promoting third-party technical support services?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>We currently have multiple terms related to tech support blocked in List Management. In some cases, such as with Microsoft, Yahoo, and Facebook support, we have been alerted by the brand owner that no other advertiser is able to provide tech support for their products, and bypasses will not be approved. Additionally, only a brand owner may offer password, account, and billing support as no other company can provide this service. Other than these scenarios, bypasses related to the support may be appropriate provided that the ads and site do not mislead users about what company is providing the support. For example, third-party companies may provide tech support for Linux, but it should be clear from their ad copy and on their sites that they are not the official Linux. If the advertiser has legitimate use for the support terms, for example, &quot;<em>Facebook</em> marketing <em>support</em> agency&quot;, bypasses may also be appropriate.<br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q20" name="S1Q20"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;Do we allow ads that falsely advertise what a software or download can do? For example, a registry cleaner that can help open .BMP files.</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>No, these ads often attempt at misleading users into believing something is wrong with their device that needs fixing when this is not the case (for example, scareware). For example, a registry cleaner should only use claims that are relevant for a registry cleaner and for what the software can achieve; saying that it can help open .BMP files is misleading. These advertisers can remediate by removing all misleading claims. If you are unsure of what the software or download can achieve, but feel that the ads could be misleading, escalate to Network Quality Services (NQS) for validation.

<strong><a id="S1Q22" name="S1Q22"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;Do we allow third-party tech support to offer remote access tech services (for example, fixing PC through remote login)?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>No, they are commonly associated with low-quality issues and introduce additional risks to our users, and are disallowed. Disallowed third-party tech support advertisers offering remote login support should not be confused with legitimate remote login products or services (for example, <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.gotomypc.com/remote-access/" target="_blank">GoToMyPC</a>, <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://secure.logmein.com/" target="_blank">LogMeIn</a>, etc.).<br>
<br>
<strong><a id="S1Q23" name="S1Q23"></a><br>
Q:&nbsp;Do we allow non-MSFT advertisers to advertise services for MSFT products?</strong></p>

<p><strong>A:&nbsp;</strong>Yes. Microsoft legitimately partners with outside companies to distribute and work with our hardware and applications, and those businesses should be permitted to advertise through Microsoft Advertising. However, third parties may not offer technical support services to individual end users for Microsoft products and services. Our third-party tech support policy - under the User Safety policy - is intended to protect these individual end users from deception/confusion.<br>
<br>
<a id="Q24" name="Q24"></a><br>
<strong>Q: Do we allow ads for miracle cures, black magic, psychic services, hypnosis, love potions, etc.?</strong><br>
<br>
<strong>A:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Disallow for misleading:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><em><span>Black magic</span></em></span></li>
	<li><span><em><span>Love potions</span></em></span></li>
</ul>

<p>Allow if advertised as experience only. Disallow if the ad, product, or service claims to heal or modify anything unsupported by factual evidence.</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><em><span>Psychic services</span></em></span></li>
	<li><span><em><span>Hypnosis</span></em></span></li>
	<li><span><em><span>Numerology and astrology</span></em></span></li>

<p><strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q1" name="S2Q1"></a><br>
Q: Will this policy apply to the entire network?</span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes. This policy is applicable to both advertisers on the demand side, as well as publisher partners on the supply side globally.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<strong><span><span><span><a id="S2Q2" name="S2Q2"></a><br>
Q: How does this policy compare to others within the industry?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The main goal of the policy revision is to ensure parity with other applicable requirements both within the industry, as well as internally at Microsoft. Even though we may differ in some specific products which we have elected not to support, such as ad injecting software, there are no material differences from comparable policies at Google, other Microsoft divisions, and industry best practices. </span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q3" name="S2Q3"></a><br>
Q: Are we working with other Microsoft divisions?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes. We have an established internal working group with other divisions within Microsoft. Internal alignment efforts are done in conjunction with, especially, the Windows team in this space. </span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q4" name="S2Q4"></a><br>
Q: What are the main changes from the current policy?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> In spirit, the requirements are similar to the current version. However, given industry evolution and recent trends, we have elaborated further in key areas such as: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>Potentially Unwanted Software (PUA)</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Digital signatures</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Unauthorized distribution</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Reference to other policies which may apply at times, such as MMPC&rsquo;s Objective Criteria</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><strong><span><span><span><a id="S2Q5" name="S2Q5"></a><br>
Q: What is PUA?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Potentially Unwanted Software (or PUA) is software that denies the user&rsquo;s choice and consent over their experience and interactions with software, even though not necessarily damaging the device or being malicious per se (malware). PUA is an expanded classification common to, among others, antivirus entities to further protect user experience. An example would be software which changes default settings on the device unbeknown to the user. </span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q6" name="S2Q6"></a><br>
Q: Do we require consent to change default search settings on a user device?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes. User consent is required to modify the search provider on the search functions, home page, and new tab. User consent must be informed, based on clear and transparent disclosures upon install.</span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q7" name="S2Q7"></a><br>
Q: What types of digital signatures will we accept?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> All software requires digital signature. Digital signature must be from a reputable entity. If self-signed, software must be developed by a trustworthy source, such as a first party signed Microsoft software for example.&nbsp; </span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q8" name="S2Q8"></a><br>
Q: Are we banning software bundles?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> No. Software bundles are still allowed provided compliance with policies including, among others, both clear disclosures of all secondary offers in a bundle and the ability to easily decline. </span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q9" name="S2Q9"></a><br>
Q: What is unauthorized distribution?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Software distribution must be authorized by the owner of the software through its distribution channels of choice. Software distribution which happens outside of the owner of the software&rsquo;s agreements is classified as unauthorized distribution, that is, without the knowledge and consent from the owner of the software.</span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q10" name="S2Q10"></a><br>
Q: How do we manage authorized distributors?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Unauthorized distribution is disallowed, especially on those popular free desktop software products for which we have higher traffic. Only the owner of the software and its authorized distributions can promote the software. Authorized distributors will be added to the allow list upon proof of authorized distribution through the web form. Only the owner of the software can complete and submit the form either for themselves or on behalf of a distributor seeking authorization. It will take about a week for authorization and allow listing to take effect. This authorization process is similar to Google&rsquo;s <u>Application to advertise free desktop software as an authoritative distribution site application</u>.</span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q11" name="S2Q11"></a><br>
Q: Will there be additional cleanup efforts on software download queries?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> As always, we strive to provide the best possible experience for our users. Relevancy and quality tuning are common practice, especially on those intent-specific queries such as brand specific (for example, &ldquo;download Skype&rdquo;), and/or queries which may be targeted by spam or less relevant results. It is possible that some advertisers may experience a drop in impressions in those areas.&nbsp; </span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q12" name="S2Q12"></a><br>
Q: When are we planning to execute the change?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The updates will be staged throughout 1/2Q FY17. Internal GTM was completed mid-July, external communications went out in mid-September (9/12), with full scale enforcement by early October (10/3).</span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q13" name="S2Q13"></a><br>
Q: Will there be external communications to advertisers and partners?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Yes. External emails to potentially impacted advertisers went out the same time the policy changed externally (9/12). A blog post followed on 9/13. </span></span></span><br>
<span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q14" name="S2Q14"></a><br>
Q: What is the rejection message when an advertiser violates the unauthorized distribution - software download policies?</span></span></strong></span><strong><span><span><br>
<br>
A: </span></span></strong><span><span>Below is an example of the rejection messaging you would see if the ad was impacted in the US. This policy is global and rejections can occur at either the ad and/or keyword level, so the message you&rsquo;ll see in an account will reflect the actual customer impact.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Violation: Unauthorized Distribution<br>
Countries: US<br>
Location: Ad</span></span><br>
<span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q15" name="S2Q15"></a><br>
Q: Where can I find the software distribution authorization form?</span></span></strong><span><span><br>
<br>
<strong>A:</strong> The link to the form is within the rejection message and the advertiser can access it directly. There is generally no need to provide this direct link to the advertiser. The form is also hidden and cannot be found in the Microsoft Advertising site. Do not propose to the advertiser to complete the form unless you are 100% sure they will be and/or are impacted by this policy enforcement. Use the direct link to the form:&nbsp;<a href="https://advertise.bingads.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/policies/software-distribution-authorization-form" managed-link="" target="_blank">Software distribution authorization</a></span></span><span><span>.</span></span></span><br>
<span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q16" name="S2Q16"></a><br>
Q: How will the advertiser be informed if they are approved/disapproved for&nbsp;the authorization?</span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><br>
<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Both the owner of the software and the email listed for the Microsoft Advertising account requesting authorization will be emailed directly with the approved/disapproved response.</span></span></span><br>
<span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q17" name="S2Q17"></a><br>
Q: Where can I find information about the popular free software we monitor and the advertisers who are authorized to advertise these branded products?</span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><br>
<br>
<strong>A:</strong> </span></span></span><span><span><span>Up-to-date information can be found in EVD List Management.</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>To identify the popular free software we monitor</span></span></span><span><span><span>:<br>
	Under the <strong>Default Flag for Term</strong> tab, search by <strong>Default Flag Area </strong>equals<strong> 258-Software Download &ndash; Unauthorized Distribution</strong>.</span></span></span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span><span><span>To identify authorized advertisers</span></span></span><span><span><span>: </span></span></span>
	<ol>
		<li><span><span><span>On the <strong>Override Flag for Advertiser</strong> tab, search by:</span></span></span>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><span><span><span>Country</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> equals <strong>All</strong></span></span></span></li>
			<li><strong><span><span><span>Override Flag Area</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> equals <strong>258-Software Download &ndash; Unauthorized Distribution</strong></span></span></span><br>
			<br>
			This will return a short list of customers who are approved to advertise for all popular free software brands. If you don&rsquo;t find your customer, go to step 2.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><span><span><span>On the <strong>Override Flag for Term</strong> tab, search by:</span></span></span>
		<ul>
			<li><strong><span><span><span>Language</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> equals <strong>English</strong></span></span></span></li>
			<li><strong><span><span><span>Override Flag Area</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> equals <strong>258-Software Download &ndash; Unauthorized Distribution</strong></span></span></span></li>
			<li><strong><span><span><span>Advertiser ID</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> equals <strong>{your Advertiser&rsquo;s ID}</strong></span></span></span><br>
			<br>
			This will return a list of the specific software brands that your customer is approved to advertise, if any.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ul>

<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q18" name="S2Q18"></a><br>
Q: A new customer is offering software downloads and wants to know if they can advertise on </span></span></span>Microsoft Advertising<span><span><span>. They&rsquo;ve provided a URL to their website and there are no rejections in their account. How should we proceed?</span></span></span><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Review their site to determine if brand owner authorization is required. If it is, provide the customer with a link to the authorization form (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=825542) and inform them 1) that the brand owner must complete and submit the form on their behalf; 2) the customer must have a Microsoft Advertising account number and will need to create ads and keywords in their account for review.</span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q19" name="S2Q19"></a><br>
Q: What if I&rsquo;ve reviewed a software download customer&rsquo;s site and I&rsquo;m not sure if they will need authorization or not?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Submit a site review request to the market-specific Ad Quality Team, following the standard site review escalation process. Make sure to call out that you&rsquo;re trying to determine whether the customer is in violation of our software download policy.</span></span></span><br>
<strong><span><span><span><br>
<a id="S2Q20" name="S2Q20"></a><br>
Q: What types of software are regulated under the unauthorized distribution policy?</span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span><br>
<br>
A:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp; Currently, only free desktop software is regulated (for example, as Internet Explorer, Firefox, and VLC). Paid and free trial software is not regulated (for example, Office Suite, Photoshop, Norton Antivirus, and McAfee free trial). If the promoted software download is free, the customer must obtain authorization from the brand owner to advertise. However, if it must be purchased or is available as a free trial, brand owner authorization is not required to advertise. Free trial software for a &ldquo;free&rdquo; software, for example Chrome, is misleading and disallowed.</span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>Do not inform customers that free trial software isn&rsquo;t regulated</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> as there&rsquo;s a possibility that they could abuse policy if this information is disclosed. If a customer is advertising software downloads for purchase, regardless of whether a free trial is offered, inform them that they are compliant with policy because paid software downloads are not regulated. Therefore, they can advertise with us.</span></span></span><br>
