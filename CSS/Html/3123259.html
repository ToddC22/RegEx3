This form relies on the customer remembering several details about their account usage that can be difficult to remember, so this process should only be used after all other attempts to regain access to an account have failed.</p>

<ol>

	<li>Suggest creating a new account to the customer as an alternative, especially for those with few purchases, young accounts, or accounts with few Microsoft services.</li>

<p class="sbody-h4">After explaining what the follow-up process will be, have the customer check to see if they already received an email response. While responses can take up to 24 hours, most customers will receive an email within a couple of minutes.</p>

<p><br>
If the customer received a rejection, they can try the process again if they feel that they remembered or could do some research to answer the questions on the form, (like contacting friends or family for the subject lines of emails they recently sent if they have an Outlook/Hotmail account). If we&#39;ve assisted the customer in filling out the form and they have no new info, we should recommend they create a new account.</p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>: </span></span></span></span>ACSR considers whether the profile information entered in the form matches what we have on record. However, since profile information is readily discoverable online, ACSR takes other factors about the request into account as well. Profile information alone is insufficient to grant the password reset.<br>
