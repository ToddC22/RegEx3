<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Description of Service:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Text Analytics</span></p>

<p>Text Analytics API is a suite of text analytics services built with Azure Machine Learning. We currently offer APIs for sentiment analysis, key phrase extraction and topic detection for English text, as well as language detection for 120 languages. In this initial preview release, we offer APIs for sentiment analysis and key phrase extraction of English text. No labeled or training data is needed to use the service - just bring your text data.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>What is Sentiment Analysis</span> - Let&#39;s say you run a website to sell handicrafts. Your users submit feedback on your site, and you&#39;d like to find out what users think of your brand, and how that changes over time as you release new products and features to your site. Sentiment analysis can help here - given a piece of text, the Azure ML Text Analytics service returns a score between 0 and 1 denoting overall sentiment in the input text. Scores close to 1 indicate positive sentiment, while scores close to 0 indicate negative sentiment.</p>

<p><span>Key Phrase Extraction</span> - This service can also extract key phrases, which denote the main talking points in the text. We employ techniques from Microsoft Office&#39;s sophisticated Natural Language Processing toolkit.</p>

<p>For example, for the input text &lsquo;The manual transmission is a bit twitchy. Also, the vehicle is old-school&rsquo;, the service would return the main talking points: &lsquo;manual transmission&rsquo;, &lsquo;vehicle&rsquo; and &lsquo;old-school&rsquo;.</p>

<p><span>Topic Detection - </span>This is a new service which returns the topics which have been detected in multiple text articles. The service is designed to work well for short, human written text such as reviews and user feedback, and can help you to understand the main issues or suggestions that customers are mentioning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Language Detection</span> - The service can be used to detect which language the input text is written in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Recommendations </span></p>

<p>The recommendation engine may be trained by uploading data about past customer activity or by collecting data directly from your digital store. When the customer returns to your store you will be able to feature recommended items from your catalog that may increase your conversion rate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Frequently Bought Together (FBT) Recommendations - </span>In this scenario the recommendations engine will recommend items that are likely to be purchased together in the same transaction with a particular item.</p>

<p>For instance, in the example below, customers who bought the Wedge Touch Mouse were also likely to buy the at least one of the following product in the same transaction: Wedge Mobile Keyboard, the Surface VGA Adapter and Surface 2.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Item to Item Recommendations - </span>A common scenario that uses this capability, is &quot;people who visited/clicked on this item, also visited/clicked on this item&quot;.</p>

<p>For instance, in the example below, most people who visited the &quot;Wedge Touch Mouse&quot; details page also visited the pages related to other mouse devices.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Customer to Item Recommendations - &nbsp;</span>Given a customer&#39;s prior activity, it is possible to recommend items that the customer may be interested in.</p>

<p>For instance, given all movies watched by a customer, it is possible to recommend additional content that may be of interest to the customer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>New Meter for Speaker Recognition and Speaker Verification API public preview</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Speaker Verification</span></p>

<p>Voice has unique characteristics that can be used to identify a person, just like a fingerprint. Using voice as a signal for access control and authentication scenarios has emerged as a new innovative tool &ndash;essentially offering a level up in security that simplifies the authentication experience for customers.</p>

<p>Speaker Verification APIs can automatically verify and authenticate users using their voice or speech.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Enrollment</span></p>

<p>Enrollment for speaker verification is text-dependent, which means speakers need to choose a specific pass phrase to use during both enrollment and verification phases.</p>

<p>In enrollment, the speaker&#39;s voice is recorded saying a specific phrase, then a number of features are extracted and the chosen phrase is recognized. Together, both extracted features and the chosen phrase form a unique voice signature.</p>

<p><span>Verification</span></p>

<p>In verification, an input voice and phrase are compared against the enrollment&#39;s voice signature and phrase &ndash;in order to verify whether or not they are from the same person, and if they are saying the correct phrase.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Speaker Identification</span></p>

<p>Speaker Identification APIs can automatically identify the person speaking in an audio file, given a group of prospective speakers. The input audio is paired against the provided group of speakers, and in the case that there is a match found, the speaker&rsquo;s identity is returned.</p>

<p>All speakers should go through an enrollment process first to get their voice registered to the system, and have a voice print created.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Enrollment</span></p>

<p>Enrollment for speaker identification is text-independent, which means that there are no restrictions on what the speaker says in the audio. The speaker&#39;s voice is recorded, and a number of features are extracted to form a unique voice signature.</p>

<p><span>Recognition</span></p>

<p>The audio of the unknown speaker, together with the prospective group of speakers, is provided during recognition. The input voice is compared against all speakers in order to determine whose voice it is, and if there is a match found, the identity of the speaker is returned.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
