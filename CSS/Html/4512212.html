<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Overview</h4>

<p>The latest AI-powered feature for small businesses from Microsoft Advertising, smart campaigns, continually improve ad performance (auto-optimize), allowing small and medium businesses (SMB) to spend more time running their business. They provide automated ad campaign optimization, quick set up, minimal ongoing management, and customer reach across Bing, Yahoo!, and partner websites.</p>

<p>Customers should sign up in smart mode if they:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Have a functioning website that is ready to use.</li>
	<li>Do not have a lot of time on their hands.</li>
	<li>Do not intend on using advanced ad features.</li>
</ul>

<p>Customers should sign up in expert&nbsp;mode if they:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Intend on using advanced ad features.</li>
	<li>Are agencies or large direct advertisers with complex business models.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="1.4" name="1.4"></a>1.4&nbsp;Identifying smart campaigns in UCM-A and Microsoft Advertising</h4>

<p><strong>Smart mode account</strong><br>
In UCM-A, view account mode either at the customer level in the account list or at the account level in the account details card.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: The MSA mode column may need to be added to your views by adjusting your account summary settings or adding columns to the account list view.</p>

<p><strong>Smart mode</strong> indicates when an entire account (XID) is enabled only for smart campaigns. When a customer switches to expert mode, the account will show as expert in the UCM-A <strong>MSA mode</strong> column.</p>

<h3><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Smart campaign settings and&nbsp;management</h3>

<p><strong>UCM Opportunities: </strong>UCM opportunities are not currently relevant to smart campaigns and should be ignored.</p>
</div>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Smart accounts converted to expert may still have relevant opportunities for their full-feature campaigns. Be sure to check all campaign types before dismissing opportunities as irrelevant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because smart campaigns are automatically optimized, there are limited optimization capabilities so it&rsquo;s good to ensure all settings are current. For more information, see <a href="https://help.ads-int.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56932/-1-500" target="_blank">Smart campaigns: Monitor your campaign&#39;s performance</a>.</p>

<p>To determine how a smart campaign is performing, <strong>focus on the</strong> <strong>goals</strong> defined, then review metrics on impressions, clicks and number of verified phone calls received. Smart campaigns optimization capabilities are limited to the settings outlined below:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Create a new campaign</span></span></strong><span><span>: Create a new campaign to target a new radius location, test additional promotions, and use distinct landing pages in ads.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Modify campaign goals:</span></span></strong><span><span> The campaign goal that customers select will help guide them through campaign setup but cannot be changed once set. For example, if a customer chooses <strong>Get more phone calls to my business</strong>, customers will be required to enter in a phone number while it is optional if other goals are selected.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Keyword Themes:</span></span></strong><span><span> Advertisers should choose keyword themes that best reflect their offerings. Selections help the system target relevant search phrases so be sure to select at least four-five. Keyword Themes are subject to normal editorial review. See KB </span></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4521657" target="_blank"><span><span><span>4521657 Ad Quality SOP: Smart campaigns editorial support</span></span></span></a><span><span> for details.

	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Refine Ad copy:</span></span></strong><span><span> The landing page and other signals are used to automatically generate the first ad unless the keyword themes are entered manually. Not all advertisers will see proposed ad copy. For more information, see </span></span><a href="https://help.ads-int.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56931/-1-500" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Smart campaigns: About effective ads</span></span></span></a><span><span>. Smart campaigns may contain up to 100 ads. Ad copy is subject to normal editorial review. See KB </span></span><a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4521657" target="_blank"><span><span><span>4521657 Ad Quality SOP: Smart campaigns editorial support</span></span></span></a><u> </u><span><span>for details.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Manage search phrases:</span></span></strong><span><span> Smart campaigns will automatically determine when an ad delivers. Advertisers will see a sample of search phrases, but advertisers can disable search phrases to prevent their ad from delivering on terms they deem irrelevant. On rare occasions, advertisers may see </span></span><a href="https://help.bing.microsoft.com/#apex/18/en-US/10001/-1" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Bing advanced search operators</span></span></span></a><span> </span><span><span> which tailor organic results, these do not affect paid ad delivery. </span></span><a href="https://help.ads-int.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56933/-1-500" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Smart campaigns: How your settings for locations, products, and services affect who sees your ads</span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Refine locations/targeting:</span></span></strong><span><span> Target multiple locations using within a specific location or a single location using radius. For more info, see </span></span><a href="https://help.ads-int.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56929/-1-500" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Smart campaigns: Where and when will my ads appear?</span></span></span></a></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Adjust Budget</span></span></strong><span><span>: A daily budget (standard) will be recommended based on other signals. Advertisers can use the performance estimates to help set a budget for their desired reach. For more information, see </span></span><a href="https://help.ads-int.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56934/-1-500" target="_blank"><span><span><span>Smart Campaigns: About budgets and what you pay for</span></span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Note regarding Bids:</span></span></strong><span><span> There are no keyword bids within smart campaigns. The system will automatically determine how much to bid for a search term based on your budget and other indicators to maximize your campaign&rsquo;s value. Advertisers can manage their search phrases and expand keyword themes.</span></span></span></span></li>

Ensure the customer is aware that Expert Mode requires regular maintenance to ensure optimal performance and competitiveness. To switch a Smart mode account to Expert mode, access the Gears menu and select <strong>Switch to Expert Mode</strong>. Accounts <strong>cannot</strong> be switched back to Smart. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: Agencies <strong>must </strong>switch their CID to expert mode to enable client account linking. Expert mode agencies <span><span><strong>can</strong></span></span> manage Smart mode client accounts.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>After conversion: </span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Ensure the customer understands the account will require ongoing management to remain competitive and consider referring them to Onboarding Consultation (see KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4510981" managed-link="" target="_blank">4510981 Process: Microsoft Advertising: Support &amp; Services Cross-Team Phone Transfers</a>) or providing guidance/walkthrough with resources relevant to their reason for switching to expert (for example, give them a tour and share both <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.ads-int.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51016/0" managed-link="" target="_blank">How to get your campaigns up and running in Microsoft Advertising</a> and <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.ads-int.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/51004/1" managed-link="" target="_blank">How to target my customers by adjusting bids</a> if their reason for conversion was a desire for sophisticated bid management.)</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Existing Smart Campaigns will appear in the campaigns list and will be labelled <strong>smart</strong> under Campaign type.

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To Achieve More with a Smart Campaign, focus on ensuring complete setup for new customers and ensuring awareness of Smart Campaign capabilities (outlined above) and advocating other resources, like User Voice.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>For smart mode manager accounts, conversion to Expert mode should <strong>not</strong> be pitched unless the customer expresses willingness to invest more time in managing their accounts and has interest in or need for more complex features and functionality. Refer to <a bookmark-id="3" href="#3" managed-link=""><span>section 3</span></a></span></span><span> </span><span><span> and the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/StandardSupport/l1resources/Agent%20Resources/KB%20Documents/Smart%20Campaigns/Smart%20vs.%20expert%20mode.pptx?web=1" managed-link="" target="_blank">Smart verses Expert &ndash; Best Fit decision-making matrix</a> to advise on the best path for the customer.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong> </strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: If the customer is following up on an existing ticket in another queue, standard ticket handling guidelines apply, and the existing ticket should be updated/pulled rather than a new ticket created. </span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the MSA mode is smart or the customer&rsquo;s inquiry is specific to Smart Campaigns, be sure to set<strong> Campaign Type = Smart Campaign</strong>. Inversely, if the MSA mode is expert and is not a smart campaign inquiry, be sure to set Campaign Type to the most appropriate value (such as, Not Applicable or Search). For presales inquiries, set <strong>Campaign Type = Not applicable</strong> unless/until an account is created, then select the most appropriate value per the chart below.</span></span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></p>

<h3><a id="7" name="7"></a>7. Manual CPC &ndash; Bid Strategy Deprecation (Pilot)</h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Starting 26<sup>th</sup> August, 2020, we will be testing the removal of the Manual CPC bid strategy for <strong>new signup</strong> customers who choose to create SMART campaigns. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>After this date, if customers switch from SMART to Expert campaigns, they will no longer have the option to run manual CPC bids. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Instead, customers will be able to use <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56786/1/en-US/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Enhanced CPC</a>, which provides them with the ability to choose a desired CPC average that the system will target, whilst still modifying bids to try and get the advertiser the best chance for a conversion. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Opting-out</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Although opt-out is possible, we encourage advocates not to provide this as their primary solution if a customer asks to switch back to Manual CPC. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Instead, use the FAQ talking points below to educate the advertiser and reassure them that Enhanced CPC will continue to provide them with the effective bid management solution they desire.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>If an advertiser continues to insist on returning to Manual CPC, you can escalate to Global Support, who will contact engineering to make this request. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>FAQ</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Q: Does Microsoft Advertising still allow&nbsp;manual bidding?</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>With advertisers increasingly relying on platform automation, Microsoft Advertising is currently testing automated bid only campaigns. We&rsquo;ve seen multitudes of success stories where customers are seeing improved ROI with auto bidding, and we are confident that this change will benefit our users.</span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Q: I still want to manage ad group and keyword level bids. Is this possible?</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>Yes! You can continue to set ad group and keyword level bids by selecting the Enhanced CPC bid strategy (default). <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/blog/post/august-2016/get-more-conversions-with-the-new-enhanced-cpc-bid-strategy" managed-link="" target="_blank">Enhanced CPC</a> automatically adjusts your bids at auction time so that you bid up on users who are more likely to convert and bid down on users less likely to convert. Your CPC will not exceed your bid, on average. </span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>Q: How can I control my ROI?</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span><span>A:&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising offers a variety of auto bidding strategies to meet your needs. Refer to this <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://about.ads.microsoft.com/solutions/tools/automated-bidding" managed-link="" target="_blank">auto bidding documentation</a> page for help deciding which strategy is best for you. If granular control is desired, you can continue to manage keyword level bids through Enhanced CPC, which allows for this and at the same time takes advantage of auction time enhancements.</span></span></span></span></p>
