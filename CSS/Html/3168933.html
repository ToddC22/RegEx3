<h3><span><span><span><span><span>When should this article be used?</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>This article covers how to identify and handle invalid clicks/leads, which are clicks that are not legitimate traffic. This could be traffic from bots, crawlers, or an advertiser&rsquo;s competitors clicking on their ads to deplete the budget quickly.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1 Systematic checks to identify and omit invalid clicks</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising recognizes that invalid clicks can be a serious issue for pay-per-click advertisers, and has several systematic methods to sort out suspected invalid clicks so that advertisers only pay for valid traffic performed by users. Clicks are analyzed on a systematic basis to determine validity. Click traffic that is identified as invalid as a part of these systematic checks is removed from the Microsoft Advertising billing system so advertisers are not charged for this traffic.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>These checks are done in both real-time, and after the clicks occur.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a>1.2 Online click analysis</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising has developed a variety of proprietary technologies that help protect an advertiser&rsquo;s budget from invalid clicks. We identify invalid clicks by performing the following tasks:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Analyzing search patterns.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Differentiating between malicious clicks, user errors, and valid clicks.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Using campaign performance data to help identify invalid clicks.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a>1.3 Real-time click analysis</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Clicks that are identified as invalid at the time of click are automatically filtered out of reports and will not appear on an advertiser&rsquo;s bill.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For example: An advertiser&#39;s ad group receives 1,160 clicks, and Microsoft Advertising determines that 1,000 invalid clicks occurred before the click counts were reported. In this case, the advertiser&#39;s reporting will show the 160 valid clicks, and the advertiser will only be billed for 160 clicks. To view these low-quality clicks, you can pull account or campaign performance reports in Microsoft Advertising and select the <strong>low-quality clicks</strong> column.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="1.4" name="1.4"></a>1.4 Post-report (Offline) click analysis</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising has a team of click analysts who review and analyze click behavior to identify invalid clicks that cannot be found without reviewing the data over a longer period.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Clicks will remain in the report data even if they are identified as invalid after the report has been posted, but the bill will be automatically adjusted to remove the invalid clicks.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><strong>For example:</strong> An advertiser&#39;s ad group receives 1,160 clicks and Microsoft Advertising posts the report for 1,160 clicks. After the posting, Microsoft Advertising determines that 1,000 invalid clicks occurred. Since this is a post-report click analysis, the advertiser is not notified that 1,000 clicks were invalid. The advertiser&#39;s reporting and billing will show 1,160 clicks, but the charge will only reflect the cost of 160 clicks.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="1.5" name="1.5"></a>1.5 Manual checks to identify and omit invalid clicks (On advertiser request)</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>It is also important that advertisers monitor their account performance regularly because some invalid clicks are not detected by these systematic checks. If an advertiser contacts us inquiring about the validity of clicks on their account, or about a sudden spike in irrelevant traffic, assist them using the process outlined below.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Handling the conversation with the advertiser</span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Reasons for spikes in traffic</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>There are many legitimate reasons that advertisers can see spikes in traffic/clicks:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Seasonal changes, such as an increase in online shopping during the holidays, or based on the advertiser&rsquo;s business model (for example: An accountant may see spikes during tax season).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Sales, discounts, or promotions that increase visibility and bring extra traffic to your site.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Recent news events that stimulate online consumer interest and web traffic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Changes to your ad headings or text, or changes to your website.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>New links to your website from other sites.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Spikes in traffic can come from any of several of the following sources: Search O&amp;O, Search Syndication, Content Ads, Mobile, etc. Often there is something in the news that drives the increased clicks during a short period of time (lasting several days). These are typically legitimate clicks driving legitimate traffic to the advertiser&rsquo;s site.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Educate the customer on the possible reasons for a spike in traffic (see above). DO NOT use the term &ldquo;click fraud&rdquo; until you and Traffic Quality have done a deeper investigation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Assure the customer that <em>&ldquo;Microsoft Advertising&nbsp;has a commitment to click validity and has technology in place to detect and remove low-quality clicks. In some cases, the system does not detect the behavior, so we also have a team of experts to do manual investigations.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><span><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. Researching claims of invalid clicks/leads</span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Always research and validate the advertiser&rsquo;s claim of invalid clicks before sending an escalation to Traffic Quality (TQ). Refer to the</span></span></span><span><a href="https://sharepoint.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/sites/StandardSupport/l1resources/default.aspx" target="_blank"><span><span><span><span><span> Escalation Guide</span></span></span></span></span></a></span><span><span><span> for Sub-Team destination details.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Pull reporting based on the date range and details the advertiser is referring to. If possible, try to find the specific keyword(s) driving the incident. Pull daily traffic (at the most specific report level possible, ideally keyword) with at least a week of data on each side of the incident. If the incident is more than a week old, pull daily/weekly reports at least a month on each side of the incident to confirm the claim is accurate.</span></span></span></span></span></span>

	<ol>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Go to Click reports.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If not already expanded in the left pane, select <strong>Standard reports</strong>, then select <strong>Performance</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the performance report you want.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the unit of time and the download format you want.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Run</strong>, or <strong>Download</strong> to download the report as CSV, TSV or XLSX (Microsoft Office Excel) file.<br>
		<br>
		<strong>Note</strong>: Clicks flagged as low-quality (with a number other than 0 in the column) are not charged and will not show up on the advertiser&rsquo;s bill.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Hone the issue to its root source. If the advertiser is opted into syndication or Content Ads, pull publisher reports to determine if there are specific publishers causing the issue. You can determine this on the ad-group or campaign settings link, under <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Ad distribution</strong>. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Some</span></span></span><span><span><span> markets are opted in by default and cannot opt out.</span></span></span><span><span><span><br>

Ad Distribution Descriptions:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>All search networks: Bing, Yahoo and partners. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Bing and Yahoo owned and operated only - These include bing.com, yahoo.com, msn.com and other websites that are owned by either Microsoft or Yahoo. Because of this ownership, there is strong control of traffic quality.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Bing and Yahoo syndicated search partners only - These are publishers that Microsoft or Yahoo have partnered with, that use Microsoft Advertising to power the results on their search pages. Traffic quality control is not as strong for these websites because they are not owned by Microsoft or Yahoo.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Content network- Content Ads (or contextual ads) are listed on publisher pages where the ads are related to the content in the articles on the page. These ads are typically triggered by words in the content of the article that match the advertiser&#39;s keywords or ads. Content Ads are not driven by an end user searching for keywords on a search bar. Content Ads are not available in all markets.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<ol>
	<li value="1"><span><span><span><span><span><span>Filter syndication from O&amp;O search and uses pivot tables to help research publisher reports.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Locate the lift in traffic and determine the dollar amount attributed to the lift (dollar amount = average daily spend during suspected traffic quality on specific keyword/s or publisher sites &ndash; minus &ndash; average daily spend before and/or after the spike). If the advertiser provides a suspected dollar amount, you can make note of it, but DO NOT ask the advertiser directly for a dollar amount they are questioning. Instead use your research to determine the dollar amount.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If necessary/advisable - pull a Change History report to validate any changes the advertiser (or system) may have made that could possibly have caused the click spike. For example, a sudden increase in spend may have been caused by an advertiser&rsquo;s bid increase or by the system resetting the new month&rsquo;s budget. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><span><a id="4" name="4"></a>4. Escalations to Traffic Quality (TQ) for further investigation</span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Before you escalate, research the claims by doing the checks mentioned above. Once you have done these checks, if you have not found a legitimate reason for the spike in clicks, proceed with the escalation steps below:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="4.1" name="4.1"></a>4.1 L1 escalation steps</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Set expectations with the advertiser that the investigation takes 5-9 business days. During this time, a team of experts will do a deep dive to determine if any click fraud occurred.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>While in touch with the advertiser, fill out the issue-specific details for <strong>Issue Category = Traffic Quality Escalations</strong>, <strong>Issue Type = Invalid Clicks</strong>, or <strong>Invalid Leads</strong> templates. Submit to a Senior agent (L2). All relevant items on template should be filled out. The more complete the template is, the more likely you will be successful in submitting the escalation the first time.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The dollar amount being disputed is not required to escalate but will be required to resolve any resulting dispute after the click investigation is complete. Do not ask the advertiser for a dollar amount if a disputed amount is not proactively offered. Instead, research the data based on the time period, keywords, and other details the advertiser has provided and determine the suspected lift in dollar amount the advertiser is disputing. Insert that dollar amount into the template dollar amount = average daily spend during suspected traffic quality on specific keyword/s or publisher sites &ndash; minus &ndash; average daily spend before and/or after the spike.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Web logs are not required to submit the initial escalation for invalid leads, though the Traffic Quality team may determine later that they are required and will let you know if you need to request them from the advertiser.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The submission must occur within 60 days of the date of the questionable traffic. If the customer wants us to inquire about traffic older than 60 days, use the following talking point:<br>
	<br>
	<em>&ldquo;Per Microsoft Advertising&#39;s policies regarding data retention, the maximum amount of time that the Traffic Quality team can look back is 60 days from today. Unfortunately, the Traffic Quality team no longer has access to data older than 60 days, so they will be unable to investigate this issue beyond that time. We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused you. In the future, please make sure you escalate issues relating to invalid clicks as soon as you notice the problem.&rdquo;</em></span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>If the advertiser is unwilling to provide web logs, you may skip these steps and simply escalate as much relevant information as you can gather to NQS.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>One set of the web log files should contain the period during which the invalid activity occurred.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The second set of web log files must represent a weeklong period of valid click activity occurring within the month prior to when the purported invalid activity began.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

		<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Via:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The Via general-header field must be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user agent and the server on requests, and between the origin server and the client on responses.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Vary:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The Vary field value indicates the set of request-header fields that fully determines, while the response is fresh, whether a cache is permitted to use the response to reply to a subsequent request without revalidation.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Proxy-Authorization:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The Proxy-Authorization request-header field allows the client to identify itself (or its user) to a proxy which requires authentication.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Last-Modified:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> The Last-Modified entity-header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the logs are too large to transfer via email, set up a Services File Transfer workspace to receive these web logs from the advertiser.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span><a id="4.6" name="4.6"></a>4.6 Reinvestigations&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Traffic Quality team will only consider reviewing closed investigations in the cases where new data or facts become available, and only when the request is made within 10 business days of the original close date. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Credits </span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Credits for invalid clicks are given as &#39;reinvestment credits&#39;. These take approximately 4-6 weeks to show on the advertiser&#39;s account after the investigation is complete. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span> How to find reinvestment credits in the account:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Go to the account in Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the gear icon in the upper right-hand corner of Microsoft Advertising.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select <strong>Accounts &amp; Billing</strong>. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the <strong>Billing</strong> tab.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select the desired date range from the drop-down.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If a reinvestment credit has been issued, it will appear as a negative amount under <strong>Invalid Activity</strong>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Refunds are never given for invalid click investigations. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><span><a id="5" name="5"></a>5. Optimizing for Traffic Quality</span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Advertisers can improve traffic quality by using Microsoft Advertising tools to analyze and manage traffic regularly.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>They can:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Implement Campaign Analytics to track conversions: this will help in analysing traffic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Target ads by geographical location using the Location Targeting feature.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Set up a daily budget for campaigns (to manage daily traffic spikes).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Monitor and manage syndicated search networks to meet business needs:</span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Pull publisher performance reports in Microsoft Advertising and block domains (&ldquo;exclude websites&rdquo; feature) that are driving clicks but not converting well. Advertisers can determine sites that aren&rsquo;t converting using Microsoft Advertising conversion tracking or their own weblogs. <strong>Note</strong>: Google.com will sometimes show up in publisher performance reports due to Yahoo partnerships with third parties using Google or Google-related syndicated networks. For example, a third-party site may have a Google toolbar addition. These are valid publisher clicks.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Create separate but identical campaigns with different budgets and keyword bids, one targeting Bing/Yahoo and the other targeting syndicated partners (for U.S., Canada, United Kingdom, Ireland, or France).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Opt out of syndicated traffic by selecting Bing/Yahoo owned and operated only (in ad group or campaign settings under <strong>Advanced Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Ad distribution</strong>). This feature is only available for some markets.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For advertisers opted in to Syndicated Search, you can suggest:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Excluding websites based on publisher report details.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Setting up conversion tracking to more easily track traffic because more clicks are a good thing if there are also more sales.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Reviewing Location Targeting settings.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Breaking syndication into its own campaign to more easily set budgets and bids&mdash;on U.S., CA, UK, FR and IE markets only.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Removing syndication altogether from impacted ad group and advertise on O&amp;O only&mdash;on U.S., CA, UK, FR and IE markets only.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For advertisers experiencing traffic spikes, you can suggest:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Adding negative keywords to high-volume keywords.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Reviewing match types for keywords to use exact match.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Monitoring high-volume keywords regularly.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Replacing high-volume keywords with more specific keywords.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Setting up a daily budget so you don&rsquo;t spend more than you want.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><span><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. Yahoo Trending Now traffic</span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Trending Now section on Yahoo is similar to Bing&rsquo;s Popular Now section and allows users to see ads without having to search for a related term. The user experience is that they will click on a Trending Now term that interests them. The user is then shown search results for that term and associated ads. If the user then clicks on the ad, they will be taken to the advertiser&#39;s landing page and that click is counted and the advertiser will be charged.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If an advertiser is bidding on trendy keywords that are relevant to current events, news, or pop culture, they may see an increase in impressions from Trending Now.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Refund not permitted:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The traffic is relevant to the advertiser&rsquo;s business model.<br>
Example: Accountant that sees a spike due to a news story on tax season.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Refund permitted:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The traffic is completely irrelevant to the advertiser&rsquo;s business model, or related to a tragic news story.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><br>

<h3><span><span><span><span><span><span><a id="7" name="7"></a>7. FAQs</span></span></span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Why doesn&rsquo;t Bing allow third-party analytics to be included in the investigation (example: Reports such as Omniture)?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Because the implementation issues or tracking methodologies differ between Microsoft Advertising reporting and third-party reporting.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I had a big spike over the last week in spend and was told it was from Trending Now traffic (a Yahoo owned-and-operated site). You told me this was valid traffic, but I got no conversions from it. Can I get my money back for this poor-quality experience?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The Trending Now section on Yahoo is similar to Bing&rsquo;s Popular Now section, and allows users to see your ad without having to search for a related term. The user experience is that they will click on a Trending Now term that interests them. The user is then shown search results for that term and associated ads. If the user then clicks on your ad, they will be taken to your landing page and that second click is counted. If you&rsquo;re bidding on trendy keywords that are relevant to current events, news or pop culture, you may see an increase in impressions from Trending Now. Although we can&rsquo;t guarantee conversions or give credit for clicks that are considered valid, we can help you understand how to optimize your campaigns for better performance on our publishers&rsquo; websites. If you wish to opt out of traffic like this in the future, I can help you with that. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>If the advertiser wishes to opt out of future Trending Now traffic, submit a request to Global Support.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I&rsquo;m getting low-quality traffic. Why should I trust your publishers?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> We invest a lot of effort in monitoring the quality of our network. Although we can&rsquo;t guarantee conversions or give credit for clicks that are considered valid, we can help you understand how to optimize your campaigns for better performance on our syndicated search partner websites. You can run the publisher performance report in Microsoft Advertising to find out which websites or domains aren&rsquo;t driving clicks that convert well for your business. You can also determine which sites aren&rsquo;t converting using Campaign Analytics in Microsoft Advertising. When we do find instances of invalid activity, we work with our engineering teams to prevent the same traffic from repeatedly impacting our advertisers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: In the last month, I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of money on clicks from syndicated sites that you say are valid, but they haven&rsquo;t returned a single conversion. Can I get my money back for these poor-quality websites?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> We invest a lot of effort in monitoring the quality of our network. Although we can&rsquo;t guarantee conversions or give credit for clicks that are considered valid, we can help you understand how to optimize your campaigns for better performance on our syndicated search partner websites. You can run the publisher performance report in Microsoft Advertising to find out which websites or domains aren&rsquo;t driving clicks that convert well for your business, and prevent your ads from displaying on them. In some markets like the US, our pricing system evaluates partner traffic at the time the click is charged and will apply a discount to that charge if the traffic is less likely to convert than sites like Bing or Yahoo Search. In addition, we use other measurements of the traffic that publishers deliver to understand how to discount. Discounts are automatically applied to advertisers where applicable.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: If you know these publishers are bad and you&rsquo;re refunding my money, why don&rsquo;t you just take the publishers down?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The identification of invalid traffic does not necessarily mean that all clicks from a single website or domain are invalid. Individual advertisers perform differently on different syndicated search partner sites. We recommend that you monitor your traffic regularly to see which sites result in conversions and exclude those that don&rsquo;t. You can omit any websites that you don&rsquo;t want to receive traffic from using website exclusions.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Why doesn&rsquo;t Microsoft exclude websites that are providing invalid clicks?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> The identification of invalid traffic does not necessarily mean that all clicks from a single website or domain are invalid. Individual advertisers perform differently on different syndicated sites. We recommend that you monitor your traffic regularly to see which sites result in conversions and exclude those that don&rsquo;t. You can determine which sites aren&rsquo;t converting using Campaign Analytics in Microsoft Advertising. Our system automatically works to detect invalid clicks through a complex system of filters and eliminates charges on any clicks we believe should not be billed to advertisers. This system identifies click and impression patterns using multiple layers of data points to help inform how the system identifies invalid clicks and impressions. We have internal teams working to monitor and update systems on a regular basis to continue ongoing protection.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: I&rsquo;m getting traffic from a publisher that doesn&rsquo;t have a search bar. How can it drive clicks?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>A publisher site isn&rsquo;t required to have a search box to participate in the network. For example, through clicking keyword links on partner websites or partners displaying a directory of topics (which act as a searched keyword), a user can be displayed sponsored links.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How can the referrer for my clicks be Google?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Google.com will sometimes show up in publisher performance reports due to Bing and Yahoo toolbar and application partnerships. When a user has one of these applications installed and is also navigating to Google, the referrer the browser supplies is Google.com (or whatever website the user is currently on) for any click activity. These are valid user clicks.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: Why am I getting such a high click-through rate from sites that appear to be all ads and have no content (these are sometimes called parked domains) and why do you allow these types of websites on your network?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Partners&rsquo; sites are different from one another and if the most prominent elements on the page are the ads, this can result in a high click-through rate. In order to be part of Microsoft Advertising, publishers must comply with strict guidelines, the same way advertisers have to comply with our editorial policies. We invest a lot of effort in monitoring our network and take action when policy compliance is in question.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: How is Microsoft protecting me as an advertiser against parked domain clicks?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Bing and Yahoo consists of many types of publishers including domain publishers.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>We invest a lot of effort in monitoring the quality of our network and we review partners regularly to ensure their adherence to Microsoft Advertising policies. Although we can&rsquo;t guarantee conversions or give credit for clicks that are considered valid, we can help you understand how to optimize your campaigns for better performance on our publishers&rsquo; websites.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Market specific note: In some markets like the US, our pricing system evaluates partner traffic at the time the click is charged and will apply a discount to that charge if the traffic is less likely to convert than sites like Bing or Yahoo Search. In addition, we use other measurements of the traffic that publishers deliver to understand how to discount. Discounts are automatically applied to advertisers where applicable.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Q: What can I do to limit future exposure to invalid leads?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> When we receive multiple reports of invalid leads tied to the same publisher, we investigate and work with our partners to fix the situation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Here are some actions you can take to help reduce the chances of seeing invalid leads:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Create separate but otherwise identical campaigns with different spend levels and keyword bids: one that targets Bing and Yahoo Search, and one that targets syndicated traffic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Create separate but otherwise identical campaigns with different spend levels and keyword bids: one that targets mobile traffic, and one that targets PC traffic. Or, opt out of receiving mobile traffic entirely.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Set a daily budget for your campaigns.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Target your ads by geographic location.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Block specific domains from which you do not wish to receive traffic.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Use CAPTCHA to prevent bots from completing your form. CAPTCHA is a type of test used on websites to ensure that the form response is generated by a person. A common type of CAPTCHA requires the user to type letters or digits from a distorted image that appears on the screen.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If possible, opt out of receiving syndicated traffic and focus only on Bing and Yahoo Search.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
