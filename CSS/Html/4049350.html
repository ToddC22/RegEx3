<p><strong><span>Email Subject:</span></strong><span class="ms-rtethemeforecolor-5-0"><span> Regarding Your Microsoft account Issue</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Service Request <strong>[<span>XXXXXXXXX</span>]</strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Hi <strong>[<span>customer&rsquo;s name</span>]</strong>,</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>My name is <strong>[<span>agent&rsquo;s First Name</span>]</strong> with Microsoft Customer Support. </span></span></span><span><span><span>I hope your day is going well. I want to thank you for taking the time to contact us for assistance with your Microsoft account. I am sorry that you are having problems with your account and I will be happy to help you. Rest assured that I am committed to resolving your issue quickly and efficiently. Let&#39;s go over the next steps in getting this resolved for you.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Your Microsoft account email address needs to be validated and verified for you to be able to continue to use the Microsoft account. I understand that you have your password, but you are still running into issues being able to update the account because of an issue with the email address. I apologize for any inconvenience this is causing you. I have a solution, though, and I am happy to tell you that this should be a quick fix for you.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>I have set your account up so that you will start to use a new email address as the main email address on the account (this is called your primary alias). The next time you sign in to your account with the current email address and password, you should be required to add a new email address to your Microsoft account. Once you fill out the form and submit your response, you will begin to use that new email address as your new sign-in credential.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Here are the steps to follow to update your account:</span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Sign in with the current account name and password at </span></span></span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/account/Account?destrt=home-index" target="_blank"><span><span>account.microsoft.com</span></span></a><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Once you are logged in, you should be on a page titled </span></span></span><strong><em><span><span><span>You&#39;ve lost access to your email.</span></span></span></em></strong></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>You will need to re-enter your password and then choose from these possible options:</span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><em><strong><span><span><span>Create a new email address as your primary alias</span></span></span></strong></em><span><span><span>: this option allows you to create a new Microsoft Outlook email address that is automatically verified.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><em><strong><span><span><span>Use an existing email address as your primary alias</span></span></span></strong></em><span><span><span>: this option allows you to use your own third-party email address (i.e. Gmail, Yahoo, etc.) for your Microsoft account sign-in. If using this option:</span></span></span></span></span></span>
		<ul>
			<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Be sure that it is an email address for which you have access to the email inbox.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
			<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The new email address cannot already be attached to another Microsoft account or Gamertag.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
			<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Please be sure to validate your new email address as soon as you update it.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><span><span><span><em><strong><span><span><span>Use an existing alias as your primary alias</span></span></span></strong></em><span><span><span>: this option allows you to use one of your already existing aliases for your primary alias.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Enter the new account name you wish to use.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Click </span></span></span><strong><span><span><span>Submit</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><span>This should get you back up and running on your Microsoft account. Once this is done, you should be able to access your account again and update any information you need. You should be able to use the account now on your devices and there should be no further issues. I hope that this has taken care of your issue for you. I apologize for any inconvenience this has caused you and I appreciate your patience during the resolution of this issue. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Please feel free to reply to this message if you have additional questions about your issue, additional information to provide me in order to continue to work toward a resolution, or to simply inform me that I can close this service request as resolved. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Thanks again for being a valued member of the Microsoft community and have a great day!</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Hi [<span>Customer</span>],</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>My name is [<span>agent&rsquo;s First Name</span>] with Microsoft Customer Support&#8203;. I understand that a situation like this one can be difficult, and I appreciate your patience while we investigated &nbsp;your account. I am contacting you today to provide the results of the investigation. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Account security is a top priority at Microsoft and we have a team dedicated to investigating and validating fraudulent activity. The account and billing activity associated with your Microsoft account was thoroughly reviewed by our fraud team and I can confirm there was account takeover of your account. Unfortunately, during the investigation process, we found that your account has Two Step Verification enabled. As a result, our system doesn&#39;t allow us to send a password reset code to your account.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>We are unable to support you to get back to your account, but we do have another option:</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Visit </span></span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com"><span><span>https://account.microsoft.com</span></span></a><span><span>, enter your Microsoft account, and select &ldquo;Next&rdquo;.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Select &ldquo;Forgot password&rdquo; to reset the account password.<br>
	You can do this if: </span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>You have access to one of the alternate email addresses or phone numbers listed on the account (these are listed in the dropdown menu when you are asked to send a code).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Or you have previously created an account recovery code (this is a long string of letters/numbers that you may have written down somewhere). </span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>If you have additional recovery methods set up on the account, such as an authentication app, these will also be shown as options.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>You may receive an email survey in a few days asking you for feedback regarding the support that I provided. I would appreciate if you could find a few minutes to share your thoughts. Your feedback will help us improve the Microsoft customer support experience. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Thank you for your understanding and patience during the investigation of your account. We value you as a customer.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span> </span></span></p>
