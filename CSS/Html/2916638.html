<h3>What is this article about?</h3>

<p><span><span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>This article provides instructions on setting customer expectations for shipping guidelines related to the following:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Product delivery status after an order has been placed through the Microsoft Store, or sales that are made from advocate purchase on behalf of (POBO) in the Membership Support Tool (MST).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Shipping timelines before placing an order.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Change a ship-to address.</span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: The ship-to address cannot be updated on the order after it is placed. If a wrong shipping address was selected, the order should be cancelled and a new one placed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: A shipment can be stopped in-transit and returned to MSFT (Intercept), but the process is only used for wrong address scenarios and HOTs. For any other scenario, inform the customer that they must refuse or return the item for a refund.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Request an UPS shipment to be held for pick up.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h3><a id="Shipping overview" name="Shipping overview"></a>1.&nbsp;Shipping overview</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Online orders placed at the United States Microsoft Store may ship via UPS, USPS, or FedEx. All shipments are subject to the courier&rsquo;s terms and conditions.</span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Important delivery notes:</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>What is the courier&rsquo;s liability when the customer signs for a delivery?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> When the customer signs for delivery, they have accepted the delivery &ndash; advise the customer to not take their signature lightly. They should reject deliveries if there&rsquo;s concern that contents may be damaged or missing.</span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>The customer should examine the box for any signs of tampering (such as cut tape, re-taped packages, broken seals) or damage (tearing, crushing, holes, water damage, flattened corners), and feel the weight of the box. If the box is excessively light or shows signs of the above, the customer should refuse the delivery if they are concerned.</span></span></span></span></span><br>
		&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Is the customer allowed to open the box to check the contents before signing?</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Usually, the delivery driver does not wait for the customer to open the box and thoroughly check contents before signing as the courier needs to make other deliveries. We can request that the courier perform an investigation if contents are missing or damaged but once the customer has signed, there are some scenarios where it may be less likely the courier will close an investigation in the customer&rsquo;s favor. Encourage customers to follow the above practices of inspecting the outer box for issues before offering their signature.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Where we ship:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The United States Microsoft Store can only ship to U.S. locations. For sales in other countries, visit one of the international online Microsoft Stores.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Shipping to a PO box is discouraged but may be possible if the customer follows these instructions:</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Letters in the address may be uppercase or lowercase.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Any of the following separator characters between letters are allowed: . , ; : # &lt; &gt; or a space.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>A full street address is required for delivery, and rural route numbers may result in a longer delivery time.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Microsoft Store does not permit a carrier to redirect a package to a new address after it has been shipped (this helps fight online fraud).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The carrier will deliver only to the address provided in the order (<em>ship to</em> address).

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The carrier will not contact the customer to validate the correct address.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer omits key address details (for example, city or postal code), the order will not be delivered. The shipment is returned to Microsoft and a refund will be issued per standard process.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer makes a mistake on the address (for example, mix up of postal code and city) the shipment is returned to Microsoft and a refund will be issued per standard process.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the postal code does not conform to the country standards (for example, space between Sweden postal code or, used in Luxembourg postal code) the shipment is returned to Microsoft and a refund will be issued per standard process.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer is not at home, the shipment will not be handed to a third party (for example, a neighbor). This is particularly relevant if the customer&rsquo;s address is in an apartment block. </span></span></span></span></span></span>

	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the warehouse identifies an invalid address on an order, they will flag it to the Microsoft supply chain team. A block is applied to the order and the supply chain team raises the order to customer service support (CSS). The CSS team contacts the customer, informs them of the issue, cancels the order and assists in placing a new order with the correct address details. In this scenario, the customer is not provided with a make-good.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>What options are available if a customer provides an incorrect address?</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Option one: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Check the order in MST. If the cancel button is available, cancel the order and assist the consumer in placing a new order with the correct delivery address details. </span></span></span><span><span><span>The ship-to address cannot be updated on the order after it is placed and this cannot be circumvented even if the product is out of stock and not re-orderable.</span></span></span><span><span><span><br>
<br>
<strong>Option two: </strong>If the order has already been shipped, determine whether the customer is capable of receiving the shipment at the address listed.

<br>
<strong>Option three: </strong>Request a hold on the package with the carrier at the closest pickup location to the customer&rsquo;s address. The customer can then visit the location at their convenience to retrieve the order.

<h3><a name="4.">4. </a>Return to&nbsp;sender</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>A shipment in transit may be refused by the customer or redirected back to the sender (Microsoft) if any issues are identified with the shipment or the order. Return to sender orders that have not been received by the customer are considered:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Return to sender (Standard)</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: The order may retain the same shipping information or have alternate tracking details attached to the initial shipment and will be returned to the distribution warehouse. These order can be refunded prior to Microsoft receiving the return shipment as long the customer was never in possession of the package.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Note</strong>: The <em>Shipment Progress</em> in the courier&rsquo;s tracking details will state <em>&ldquo;Service disruption occurred/The package will be returned to the sender&rdquo;</em>, <em>&ldquo;The customer refused the shipment/The package will be returned to the sender&rdquo;</em> or similar language.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Return to sender (Sender initiated)</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: Microsoft may request that a shipment be intercepted in transit if an issue is detected with the order, or with the customer&rsquo;s account. The order may retain the same shipping information or have alternate tracking details attached to the initial shipment and will be returned to the distribution warehouse. These orders can be refunded prior to Microsoft receiving the return shipment as long as the customer was never in possession of the package.<br>
	<br>
	<strong>Note</strong>: Intercept requests are only processed by Supply Chain, CP Fraud, or by FT4 as escalations. Escalations are only due to:</span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Order placed with the incorrect shipping address.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>

		<br>
		<strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Shipment Progress</strong> in the courier&rsquo;s tracking details will state <em>&ldquo;Sender Requested return/The package will be returned to the sender&rdquo;</em> or similar language.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Return to sender (Customer received package)</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>: The recipient has five business days to refuse the package only if the package is unopened and not tampered with. The customer can call the carrier to request a pickup or drop the package off at the carrier&rsquo;s location for a return without charge. The package must be received at the Regional Return Operations Center and be processed prior to a refund being issued.</span></span></span></span></span>
