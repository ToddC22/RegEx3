<h3 class="sbody-h3">2. Guidance<a class="bookmark" id="policy"></a></h3>
Academic specific offers are available only to customers that are verified as supported academic institutions.<br>
The first verification is conducted when the customer adds their vanity domain to their account during the sign-up flow for activating Office 365 Education A3 for Faculty Trial or Office 365 Education A3 for Students Trial.<br>
If the vanity domain is not approved, the customer will require manual verification and tagging.<br>
The EDU tag allows the customer to see and purchase the Academic offers in their portal.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<span class="text-base">NOTE</span><span class="text-base">:</span> Once a customer has been tagged as EDU, they will be able to see and provision both EDU and Commercial offers for their tenant in the Microsoft 365 admin center. If a customer tagged as EDU wants to have their tag removed in order to convert their tenant to a non-EDU tenant, refer to <a bookmark-id="s5" href="#s5" managed-link="">Scenario 5. Customer who is tagged as EDU wants to buy non-EDU offers</a>.<br>

<span class="text-base">Institutions eligible for Academic offers:</span><br>
<br>
Requirements to qualify for Office 365 for education plans depends upon the region. <span class="text-base"><span class="sbody-italic">Generally</span></span>, the following types of institutions will qualify:

<ul class="sbody-free_list">
	<li>Education institutions - Accredited institutions organized and operated exclusively for the purpose of teaching its enrolled students.</li>
	<li>Administrative offices and Boards of Education - Organized and operated for the administration of educational institutions.</li>
	<li>Public institutions:
	<ul class="sbody-free_list">
		<li>Public libraries - Primarily provide&nbsp;general library services without charge to all residents of a given community, district or region.</li>
		<li>Public museums - Public or private agency or institution organized on a permanent basis for essential&nbsp;education or aesthetic purposes.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Religious institutions - Must provide educational services to the public at large on a regular basis, with or without charges.</li>
	<li>Hospitals, Healthcare Systems, and Research Laboratories - If they are wholly owned and operated by a qualified Educational Institution as defined above. &ldquo;Wholly owned and operated&rdquo; means that the Educational Institution is the sole owner of the&nbsp;said hospital, healthcare system or research laboratory and the only entity exercising control over the said institution&rsquo;s day-to-day operations.</li>
</ul>
You can refer to this site for regional differences for Educational Institutions:&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/documentsearch.aspx?mode=3&amp;documenttypeid=7" id="kb-link-3" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&amp;DocumentTypeId=7</a>.<br>
<br>
<span class="text-base">Note:</span> These institutions don&rsquo;t guarantee that the customer&rsquo;s account will be approved for EDU offers and they still need to be validated.<br>
<br>
<br>
<a bookmark-id="Top" href="#toc" managed-link="" target="">back to the top</a><br>
&nbsp;
<h3 class="sbody-h3">3. Procedure<a class="bookmark" id="process"></a></h3>

<p>Customers that have NOT activated an Edu trial on their tenant need to be redirected to the online process. Ask the customer to sign up for an Edu trial at this <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://products.office.com/en-us/academic/office-365-education-plan" id="kb-link-5" managed-link="" target="_blank">link</a> and most importantly complete the domain verification process (self-help available at this <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/add-your-users-and-domain-to-office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611" id="kb-link-6" managed-link="" target="_blank">link</a>). This will kick off the Edu validation process in the background.&nbsp;Even if the customer is not auto-qualified from the domain add, the domain being verified on the tenant is required before the EDU tag is added in CMAT.<br>
<br>
<span class="text-base"><strong>Note</strong>: </span>If the customer has been using a Commercial tenant which has stored data, please proceed to manual validation instead of asking the customer to follow the online process.<br>
<br>
Requests might take up to 2 weeks. Ask the customer to contact support again on the 15th day, in the unlikely event that no reply is received to the validation request. Close the case.<br>
<br>
<span class="text-base"><strong>NOTE</strong>: A verified</span> vanity domain&nbsp;<span><span><span>(** not onmicrosoft.com domain)&nbsp;</span></span></span>on the customer&rsquo;s account is required even for manual validation request.&nbsp;This is to ensure the requester owns the domain being approved for edu qualification.</p>

<br>
Once receiving academic offer purchasing issues, advocates should first determine if the customer is a Volume Licensing (VL) customer by checking the Subscription Source field in the Commerce Management Agent Tool (CMAT):<br>
<br>
i. If the Subscription Source is <span class="text-base">VL</span>, refer the customer to their Microsoft Licensing Specialist to purchase the subscription. No tag is required if a customer activates their subscription via VL.<br>
<br>
ii. If the Subscription Source is <span class="text-base">Direct</span>, proceed according to the following different scenarios.<a class="bookmark" id="s1"></a></p>

<p><br>
<span class="text-base">Note:</span><br>
If the admin is NOT an actual user&#39;s name but a generic &#39;admin&#39;, then a manual validation request is necessary so please do not close the case but proceed to step c.</p>

<p>Support ambassador should insure the domain the customer is using to gain EDU qualification is verified on the customer&rsquo;s tenant. If yes, proceed to next step, if not, ask the customer to add the domain before continuing.</p>
<strong>b. If an Edu trial is activated on the desired tenant, check if there is an automatic case exists for this customer:</strong>

<br>
<strong><span class="text-base">This section describes the validation steps completed by </span></strong>advocate<strong><span class="text-base">s empowered for EDU validations.</span><br>
<br>
<span class="text-base">Step 1: Validation:</span></strong>

<ol class="sbody-alpha_list">
	<li><strong><span class="text-base">Review URL:</span></strong><br>
	<br>
	Agents are able to validate EDU customer right away through the phone during the support by checking&nbsp;the customer&rsquo;s website to see if the customer is a qualified Academic institution as per<br>
	<span class="sbody-italic"><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/documentsearch.aspx?mode=3&amp;documenttypeid=7" id="kb-link-9" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&amp;DocumentTypeId=7</a></span>*

	<ul class="sbody-free_list">
		<li>If yes, proceed to <strong><span class="text-base">Step 2</span>.</strong></li>
		<li>If no, communicate to the&nbsp;agent (case owner) that we are unable to verify eligibility at this stage and the questionnaire needs to be sent to the&nbsp;customer.&nbsp;(<strong>step 1.b</strong>.)</li>
	</ul>
	Please consider below best practices for website checking:

	<ul class="sbody-free_list">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Does the website URL&nbsp;correspond to the name of the institution?</span></span></span></span></span>

		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li><span><span><span><span><span>If not, search (using Google/Bing/etc) for the school name found on the website being reviewed.&nbsp;If the results match the website being reviewed, move ahead.</span></span></span></span></span>

			<ul style="list-style-type:square">
				<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If the search comes back with a different <span><span><span><span><span>URL&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span>for the school, fill out the questionnaire in <strong>step 1.b</strong>. and escalate to the regional EDU POC for further investigation.</span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></span></span></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Religious institutions &ndash; if they have a&nbsp;mainstream education (science, math, language, etc.) we can approve them.</li>
		<li>An organization such as a church or temple where the only education is a &ldquo;Sunday School&rdquo; or something equivalent <span>to&nbsp;</span>exclusive religious material does not qualify.<br>
		<br>
		<span class="text-base"><strong>NOTE</strong>:</span> If upon validation and the organization has been denied because it falls <span>under&nbsp;</span>this category, the agent should set the tagging to decline in CMAT after informing the customer.</li>
		<li>Best things to look for:
		<ul class="sbody-free_list">
			<li><strong><span class="text-base">Staff Listing</span></strong> &ndash; Teachers, Faculty, etc.</li>
			<li><strong><span class="text-base">Classes</span></strong> &ndash; Schedules, Grades, Groups, etc.</li>

		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong><span class="text-base">Review questionnaire:</span></strong><br>
	If the agent is unsure the eligibility of the customer at this stage, ask the customer questionnaire (embedded above) over the phone and document answers in case notes. Use questionnaire answers to determine if the&nbsp;customer qualifies. Obtain answers to the questionnaire filled out by the customer from the&nbsp;frontline and then complete the review to define if the customer is a qualified Academic institution as per <span class="sbody-italic"><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/documentsearch.aspx?mode=3&amp;documenttypeid=7" id="kb-link-10" managed-link="" target="_blank">http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&amp;DocumentTypeId=7</a></span><span class="sbody-italic"></span>*
