<h3><span lang="EN-GB">What is this article about?</span></h3>

<p><span lang="EN-GB">Root Cause Analysis (RCA) is the process of identifying the cause of a technical issue after the issue has been remediated. It should only be performed at customer request and with clear boundaries set in advance to the extent both parties will invest in identifying cause. Where cause is required to be found before an issue can be resolved, that is considered troubleshooting and is out of scope for this procedure.</span></p>

<p>[1] Azure RCA is available as standard for Premier and Broad Commercial customers following service interruptions on the Azure portal. Customers can request RCA for smaller outages and other technical issues by raising a support request.<br>

[4] RCA for High Impact Microsoft 365 Service Incidents a<span><span><span><span><span><span>re called Post Incident Reviews (PIR) and are available on Microsoft 365 admin center. If posts end with &ldquo;We&#39;ll publish a post-incident report within five business days.&rdquo;, a PIR will be received. Note: The final post (or Service Incident Report) for an incident can be found in LYNX by typing the incident ID (e.g. EX123456).</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span lang="EN-GB"></span>If a PIR is published for a specific incident, customers can be directed to Service Health Dashboard (SHD) to access it.

		<br>

			<li>For cases<strong> where root cause may potentially be related to multiple separate issues it is valid to create separate</strong> <strong>cases </strong>to investigate each possible cause.

	<li>Meet initial response and scope all new RCA cases following standard procedures. RCA scoping should include the case number of the break-fix case and an estimate of hours Microsoft will contribute to the RCA effort<span lang="EN-GB">.
