<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>As Microsoft looks to modernize the sales experience for its partners, the legacy platform, Partner Sales Connect (PSC), will be retiring. Partner Center (PC) is the &ldquo;one-stop-shop&quot; where partners engage with Microsoft, thus the referral sharing experience will also be done within Partner Center. Setting up the new platform could represent complexity for partners, which is why CED specialists have been asked to support this workstream. </span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></p>

<div class="alert-band">
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
<div class="row">
<div class="col-xs-24">
<p><strong>Note</strong>: <span><span><span><span><span>This is not a migration of active deals. Specialists must advise partners to close out active deals within Partner Sales Connect&nbsp;and use Partner Center for new deal sharing. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This workstream will be subject to change as partner volumes increase and the initiative evolves. If at any point you run into questions, concerns, or issues that you are unable to address, please inform the partner that you will do some research and then get back to them. These questions/concerns should then be captured real time and immediately flagged via the Teams site dedicated to this initiative. CSS will flag these to OCP and provide you with the correct way to proceed.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: White Glove is often focused on OCP-managed partners but is not limited to OCP-managed partners. The priority partners included in white glove have been prioritized because Microsoft wants to keep co-selling with them, co-sell more with them, or wants to begin co-selling with them.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;<span><span><span><span>There is no firm retirement date for Partner Sales Connect. Retirement of the platform will occur when a set of success criteria, defined by the co-sell program, are met. That said, migration of partners actively using PSC is targeted to complete by December 1, so that active co-sell partners are using the modern sales experience for the remainder of FY21. More importantly, there is only funding for white glove migration through Q1, so should partners choose not to migrate at this time, they will have to &ldquo;self-serve&rdquo; their migration at a later date this year, and will not have dedicated help in doing so. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If the deferral is beyond Q1, we should treat this as a decline.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span> </span></p>

<p>When the specialist gets on the phone with the partner and the steps are not completed, they should ensure the partner takes these steps while on the phone with them.</p>

<p><span> The above messaging can be included also in the final email exchange prior to sending invites to Teams calls or on the call with the partner in the first partner phase. The specialist is not the support resource for the membership, however, they will guide the partner to create a support ticket if further assistance is needed. The specialist should escalate the ticket through Get Help and the specialist will schedule a follow-up once ticket is resolved - best practice is for the specialist to reserve a placeholder on the partner&rsquo;s calendar after ending the first call together (this may be 1 week out). In addition to this, they can also use this first connection to demo the referrals module to give the partner an example of what they&rsquo;ll be working towards the next time they meet and the specialist can also share MPN ID and Solution data which may need to be updated outside the calls.</span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Send the PDM </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:w:/t/CEDCommunity-WhiteGlovemigrationsupport/EUZ40L9RTKFHgOCB-wYDiCYBIvNRZNMcAymp_JhxFZz32A?e=lU88kR" managed-link="" target="_blank">this email template</a></span><span><span><span> socializing the workstream with them</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><span><span><span><span>5.2.1&nbsp;Account &amp; Solution Updates</span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>After you confirm that the partner has the right level of access to Partner Center, the next step is to ensure the partner&rsquo;s list of accounts and solutions are correct. We have historically used the PDM to do this process. However, with the PDMs now only being informed, the White Glove team is enabled to go directly to OCP Support using the following templates:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>IMPORTANT! </span></span></span></strong><strong><span><span><span>Please note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>Before editing a template, please make a direct copy of the file and don&rsquo;t modify the original version. If you input data into the main file it will corrupt it. Additionally, please do not manually input values, use the given drop downs provided in each form.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Account Whitelisting: </span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The first step in the whitelisting process is to ensure all accounts associated with the partner have been whitelisted or deactivated. </span></span></span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/CEDCommunity-WhiteGlovemigrationsupport/ERA5eHg8ZphBtaIZrTdL0NMBQ95x46lols95IUlqwQFEeg?e=9Jhdek" managed-link="" target="_blank">This template</a></span><span><span><span> is used to request whitelisting for specific accounts for a partner. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>When sending requests to </span></span></span></span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:OCPSUP@Microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">OCPSUP@Microsoft.com</a><span><span><span><span> for white listing accounts or solutions, please follow below format for subject when you send a request.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;White Glove &ndash; Account/Solution Change Request &lt;mm/dd&gt; - &lt;requestor alias&gt;&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>E.g. &ldquo;White Glove &ndash; Account/Solution Change Request &lt;08/31&gt; - &lt;v-vamar&gt;&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>If an account is whitelisted, then its associated CRM solutions will be whitelisted automatically</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Without account being whitelisted if you send request for solutions whitelisting then it may delay and lead to further mail discussions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>So please make sure to verify account level whitelisting status, if it&rsquo;s not whitelisted (i.e &ldquo;Whitelist for PC Co-Sell&rdquo;&nbsp;is not &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;)&nbsp;then send the request to white list Account too.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Note: PC Minted solutions (i.e. where solution ID is a GUID (25 characters), not SOL-1234-XXX) are not automatically whitelisted when an account is whitelisted.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>So you need to send an explicit whitelisting request for such PC minted solutions</span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span></p>

<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To complete this process follow the below steps:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol start="1">
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Prior to submitting a request for whitelisting, you must ensure the partner&rsquo;s membership is managed or migrated to PC. View the Details section of reporting for the below columns:</span></span></span></span></span><br>

				<td>
				<p><strong>Is PC Invited</strong></p>
				</td>

				<p>(Yes/No), for partners who have been with Microsoft for longer periods of time, they likely managed their membership from PMC. Therefore, their membership had to be migrated to Partner Center.

				</td>

				<p><strong>Is PC Migrated </strong></p>
				</td>
				<td>
				<p>(Yes/No), for partners who used the legacy PMC to manage their membership, these partners need to be migrated to Partner Center before a sales migration (PSC to PC) can occur.</p>

				<p>If &ldquo;Is PC Migrated&rdquo; = No, direct the partner to either:</p>

				<p>A) Login to Partner Center at partner.microsoft.com and ensure their MPN membership is renewed; or</p>

				<p>B) Inform their PDM of the valid MPN ID they are using within Partner Center, and their PDM can update OCP CRM with this information</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p><span><span><span>Does the partner mean &quot;a week goes by and NO ONE reached out to us&quot;? Yes, once the Referral is accepted by the MSFT sales team, you can go back into the Referral and see who has accepted it on the MSFT side, including their email address. Keep in mind MSFT sellers only have to accept deals where the partner has requested some specific co-sell help (not for deals where the partner has selected the &quot;no help needed at this time&quot; value). </span></span></span></p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>You can follow up as early and as frequently whenever you want, depending on the urgency of the need the customer has.</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>There is intentionally no normalized sales stage tracking in the Referral object in Partner Center, as not all partners will align exactly with MSFT&#39;s sales stages, and this value was rarely updated in Partner Sales Connect. Rather, [the partner should] use the notes to call out specific next steps desired from the MSFT sales resource, or to update on what the latest customer needs are... and keep the estimated value and close date updated.</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>&quot;Deal share with MS reps&quot;? That&#39;s what sharing an &quot;outbound&quot; deal is - sharing with a specific MS sales rep... need more context to understand what this question is trying to convey... that&#39;s what co-sell is - sharing deals with MS sellers or other partners.</p>

<div class="faq-panel-body" faq-panel-body="">
<p>The specialist should check the deal volume in the <a href="https://msit.powerbi.com/groups/be4af5f0-770e-4e90-b7f0-9e04c864d7a8/reports/a1d5fbad-2fbd-46a7-8e53-1bbeb0e93dd0/ReportSection19fe0015b6a94a1e511d">report</a>. If less than 2-5% of the total volume a partner has shared is related to SAM or IoT, typically that is simply done in error and is not representative of a business outcome they are trying to drive. In this case, the specialist can reach out to the partner and ask what kind of co-selling they are trying to do</p>
