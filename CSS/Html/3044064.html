<header><h1>ASMS – Subscription Disabled and Dunning Process</h1></header><p>Submit a <a href="http://sharepoint/sites/fastrack/Lists/ModTrack/NewForm.aspx?RootFolder=">ModTrack</a> request to update this TSG.</p>

<h3><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</h3>

<p>This TSG provides guidance on how to assist customers that are experiencing dunning, disablement, and deprovisioning of services due to payment issues.</p>

<p>This TSG applies to all web direct customers that are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Using expired credit cards.</li>
	<li>Having Azure charges declined because of credit card limits.</li>
	<li>Disputing charges on their invoices and withholding payment.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="Definitions" name="Definitions"></a>Definitions</h4>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Dunning:</strong> This is the process of communicating with customers who have not paid for their services. These communications happen through portal notifications and emails to the Account Administrator (AA).</li>
	<li><strong>Canceled: </strong>This subscription state occurs when a customer shuts off their account (either through self-serve or through a support ticket).</li>
	<li><strong>Soft disabled:</strong><strong> This is an</strong> intermediate subscription state between <em>Active </em>and <em>Disabled</em> in which billing is stopped, and the customer&rsquo;s services are switched to a <em>read-only</em> state. Services will continue to run until the subscription is fully disabled.</li>
	<li><strong>Disabled: </strong>This is a subscription state in which all services are stopped, and all storage is switched to a <em>read-only</em> state . All services will need to be redeployed if the balance is settled on an account that is in this state. An account will be <em>deprovisioned</em> if it is left in this state for 90 days.</li>
	<li><strong>Deprovisioned:</strong> When an account is in this state, all data related to the subscription is deleted and cannot be recovered.
	<ul>
		<li>Unless specifically expedited by the customer or changed by an extenuating circumstance, this occurs 90 days after a subscription has been <em>disabled</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Banned payment instrument: </strong>This occurs when the dunning system has banned a credit card. These cards should not have charge attempts made against them.
	<ul>
		<li>Shows as <em>BanPI</em> in our tools.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="Dunning and Account Status Context" name="Dunning and Account Status Context"></a>Dunning and Account Status Context</h3>

<p>The following sections detail various processes and statuses related to dunning and deprovisioning.<br>
Note the following about this section:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For credit cards, no charge attempts are made on days 28 &ndash; 31 of any given months.</li>
	<li>There are differences in case handling between <em>Legacy</em> and <em>Modern</em> accounts. Be sure to verify which type of account you&rsquo;re supporting before referencing the following sections.</li>
</ul>

<h4><a id="Credit Card Dunning Cycle (Modern)" name="Credit Card Dunning Cycle (Modern)"></a>Credit Card Dunning Cycle (Modern)</h4>

<p>This graphic shows the dunning cycle in the Customer Support Tool (CST) for Modern customers using credit cards.</p>

<h3><a id="Support Scenarios" name="Support Scenarios"></a>Support Scenarios</h3>

<h4>Invoice Customer Is Disputing Their Bill (Modern and Legacy)</h4>

<p>If the customer is disputing an invoice while in dunning, do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Engage Global Financial Services (GFS, formerly GCS/WOCS) through a <em>task</em>.

	<ul>
		<li>Include the invoice number that the customer is disputing.</li>
		<li>See <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2647567">TSG 2647567</a> for more information about GFS.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>GFS will work with you to determine next steps for the customer&rsquo;s subscription.</li>
	<li>If the customer refuses to settle their balance, the following actions will occur (on GFS&rsquo;s side).
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>If a customer fails to provide payment, GFS will create a document outlining a request to disable the customer&rsquo;s account for non-payment and will include all relevant details.
		<ul>
			<li>The information in this document includes customer name, company name, outstanding balance, duration of the billing dispute, account manager (if applicable), and the justification for suspending the subscription.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>If applicable, GFS will engage the customer&rsquo;s account manager to notify them of the outstanding balance as a final effort to collect payment.
		<ul>
			<li>If there is no payment after engaging the account manager, GFS will inform the account manager that the customer subscription will be disabled to avoid any further charges.</li>
			<li>In the event of an executive escalation, Enterprise Azure Operations (EAO) will provide a detailed document to inform account managers of disablement for non-payment.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> If the customer pushes for re-activation, you may re-activate the subscription for 48 hours and engage GFS for further guidance. EAO will review the extension request and advise you accordingly.</p>

<h4><a id="Reinstate Disabled Subscriptions" name="Reinstate Disabled Subscriptions"></a>Reinstate Disabled Subscriptions</h4>

<p>Customers must contact support to re-enable a disabled subscription. Support engineers (SEs) may be able to re-enable the subscription depending on the disablement reason. To assist a customer with a disabled subscription, do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Determine the reason for the disabled status.
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Examples:</strong> Non-payment, monetary cap, customer self-cancellation.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Follow the process outlined in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2651536" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TSG 2651536</a>.</li>
	<li>After completing the process in the above TSG, verify that the subscription is fully active with the following steps.
	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>If the customer has a <strong>Modern</strong> account:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the customer&rsquo;s account in <strong>CST</strong>.</li>
			<li>Navigate to the <strong>Assets + Subscriptions</strong> tab.</li>
			<li>Verify that the <em>State</em> column for the customer&rsquo;s account is listed as <strong>Active.</strong></li>
		</ol>
		</li>
		<li>If the customer has a <strong>Legacy</strong> account:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the customer&rsquo;s account in <strong>CMAT</strong>.</li>
			<li>Verify that all the following statuses are <strong>Active</strong>:
			<ul>
				<li><em>Subscriptions Status</em></li>
				<li><em>Entitlement Status</em></li>
				<li><em>Fulfillment Status</em></li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ol>
		</li>

	<li>After disablement, a customer may need technical support to get their services and data re-deployed.
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>For example, the customer may need assistance re-deploying their cloud services (which get deleted when the subscription becomes disabled) or recovering their IP addresses (which are deleted unless the customer configured Reserved IPs).</li>

	<li>In these scenarios, open a new case for the customer and transfer it to the correct Azure Technical Support team.</li>

<h4><a id="Pause Dunning Process" name="Pause Dunning Process"></a>Pause Dunning Process</h4>

<p>In exceptional circumstances, we can pause the dunning process for customers or delay their payment dates.<br>
Reference the following sections for instructions on how to do this based on the customer&rsquo;s type.</p>

<p><strong>Invoice and Enterprise Agreement (EA) Customers</strong><br>
For Invoice and Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers, we can pause dunning until the 20th day of the following month.<br>
For example, invoices due in March can have dunning paused until April 20, April invoices can have dunning paused until May 20, and so on.</p>

<p>To assist Invoice and EA customers, do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Send a <strong>task</strong> to the <strong>GCS Direct CAT</strong> queue using the following template:<br>
	<strong>Subject:</strong><br>
	Payment delay request &ndash; &lt;Customer Name&gt; [&lt;Case Number&gt;]<br>
	<strong>Body:</strong></li>
</ol>

<p><strong><a id="Credit Card Customers" name="Credit Card Customers"></a>Credit Card Customers</strong><br>
For credit card customers, we can shift a bill&rsquo;s due date to 30 days into the future. The support actions for Legacy versus Modern accounts differ. Verify the customer&rsquo;s account type before using the following sections.</p>

<p>To assist <strong>Legacy</strong> credit card customers, do the following:<br>
<strong>Note: </strong>You will need to engage your TA/PTA to complete this action in CMAT.&nbsp;If this process fails, engage PayOps for further assistance.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Customers can only have this type of deferral done once. <strong>Verify</strong> that the customer has not had this deferment performed previously.

	<ul>
		<li>Check the <strong>Support Actions</strong> tab in CMAT to determine if the customer has already had a deferral applied.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>In CMAT, click on the <strong>Billing</strong> tab.</li>
	<li>Click on the <strong>Charges</strong> sub-tab.</li>
	<li>Check the customer&rsquo;s balance status.
	<ul>
		<li>We are looking for the balances in question to be in a <em>Requested</em> or <em>Failed</em> status, and a balance type of <em>ScheduleSettle</em>.</li>
		<li>If the balance the customer wants to pause is in an <em>Open</em> status, run the <strong>Process Balance</strong> function to change the balance status to <em>Requested</em>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>For balances that meet the above criteria, engage your TA/PTA so they can update the billing due date to be <strong>30 days after </strong>the current billing date.
	<ul>
		<li>If CMAT asks for comments when you update the due date, put &ldquo;N/A&rdquo; in the comments field.</li>
		<li>If the balance is in a <em>Failed</em> status prior to your update, update the status to <em><strong>Requested</strong></em>.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p>To assist <strong>Modern</strong> credit card customers, do the following:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Customers can only have this type of deferral done once. <strong>Verify</strong> that the customer has not had this deferment performed previously.

	<ul>
		<li>Check the <strong>Activities</strong> tab of CST to determine if the customer has already had a deferral applied.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Escalate to your TA/PTA, they will extend dunning using the <strong>Extend Due Date</strong> option in CST for up to 30 days.&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>TA/PTAs - follow <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4487934" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 4487934</a> section 8.4 for process.&nbsp;</li>
