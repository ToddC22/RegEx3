You can use the following three tools to remotely administer your IIS-based server: <br> <ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Internet Information Services Manager</li><li>Terminal Services</li><li>The Remote Administration (HTML) Tool</li></ul><h3 class='sbody-h3'>How to remotely administer IIS by using the Internet Information Services Manager</h3> To remotely administer IIS over an <span class='sbody-italic'>intranet</span>, use the Internet Information Services Manager. IIS 6.0 supports down-level remote administration with this tool. This means that you can use the Internet Information Services Manager on your server running IIS 6.0 to remotely connect to and administer an IIS 5.1-based server or an IIS 5.0-based server.<br><br> To use the Internet Information Services Manager, follow these steps: <br> <ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>On the IIS 6.0-based server, click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Administrative Tools</span>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Internet Information Services Manager</strong>.</li><li>On the standard toolbar, click the <strong class='uiterm'>Add a computer to the list</strong> button. Or, you can click <span class='text-base'>Connect</span> on the <span class='text-base'>Action</span> menu.<br><br> The <strong class='uiterm'>Connect To Computer</strong> dialog box appears. </li><li>In the <span class='text-base'>Computer Name</span> box, type the computer name that you want, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.<br><br> The computer is displayed under <strong class='uiterm'>Internet Information Services (IIS)</strong> in the tree pane.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: If you do not have Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and a name resolution server such as Windows Internet Naming Service (WINS) installed, you may not be able to connect to an IIS computer by using the computer name. Alternatively, you can use the IP address of the IIS computer to which you want to connect.</li><li>Expand<br><strong class='uiterm'><strong class='sbody-strong'>ComputerName</strong></strong>, where<br><strong class='sbody-strong'>ComputerName</strong> is the name of the computer that you added in step 3.</li><li>Use the Internet Information Services Manager to remotely manage IIS.</li></ol><h3 class='sbody-h3'>How to remotely administer IIS by using Terminal Services</h3> If you are an administrator, you can use Microsoft Terminal Services from any remote client computer over a network connection to remotely administer your IIS-based server. You do not have to install the Internet Information Services Manager on the remote client computer. <br><br> Terminal Services supports up-level administration. This means that you can remotely administer your server that is running IIS 6.0 by using a Terminal Services client from any computer running Microsoft Windows Server 2003, Microsoft Windows XP, Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, or Microsoft Windows 98. <br> <ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>On a computer on which the Terminal Services client is installed, start the Terminal Services client, and then connect to the remote IIS-based computer.</li><li>From the Terminal Services Client window, administer IIS as if you were logged on to the computer locally. For example, click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Administrative Tools</span>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Internet Information Services Manager</strong> to start the Internet Information Services Manager.</li></ol><h3 class='sbody-h3'>How to remotely administer IIS by using the Remote Administration (HTML) Tool</h3> With the Remote Administration (HTML) tool, you can manage IIS from a Web browser. With this tool, you can perform most of the administrative tasks that you can perform with the Internet Information Services Manager.<br> <br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: You can only use the Remote Administration (HTML) tool to administer servers that are running IIS 6.0. You cannot use this tool to administer IIS 5.1 or earlier. <h4 class='sbody-h4'>Turn on the Remote Administration (HTML) Tool</h4><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Control Panel</span>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Add or Remove Programs</strong>.</li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Add/Remove Windows Components</span>.</li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>Components</strong> list, double-click<strong class='uiterm'> Application Server</strong> and then double-click <strong class='uiterm'>Internet Information Services (IIS)</strong>. </li><li>Double-click <strong class='uiterm'>World Wide Web Service</strong>.</li><li>Click to select the <span class='text-base'>Remote Administration (HTML)</span> check box, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.</li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Next</span>.</li><li>When you are promoted, insert your Windows Server 2003 CD-ROM into the computer&#39;s CD-ROM drive or DVD-ROM drive.</li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Finish</span>.</li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Administrative Tools</span>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Internet Information Services Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <span class='text-base'><strong class='sbody-strong'>ServerName</strong></span>, where <strong class='sbody-strong'>ServerName</strong> is the name of your server, and then expand <span class='text-base'>Web Sites</span>.</li><li>Right-click <span class='text-base'>Administration</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Properties</span>.</li><li>Under <span class='text-base'>Web Site Identification</span>, record the numbers that are displayed in the <span class='text-base'>TCP Port</span> box and <span class='text-base'>SSL Port</span> boxes.
