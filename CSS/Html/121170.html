<header><h1>How to Access Environment Variables in an MS-DOS Batch File</h1></header><div class='kb-summary-section section'>The article explains how you can access environment variables within MS-DOS batch files.<br></div><div class='kb-moreinformation-section section'>The following example shows how to test for the existence of an environment variable:<br><br><pre class='sbody-pre'><br>   IF &quot;%VARIABLE%&quot; == &quot;&quot; GOTO MODULE<br> </pre>This example checks for the existence of the environment variable &quot;VARIABLE.&quot; If VARIABLE does not exist, the statement is true and control of the batch file jumps to the MODULE section. If the statement is not true, that is, the VARIABLE variable does exist, program control skips to the next line of the batch file and continues.<br><br><br>NOTE: The quotation marks are necessary only when a variable is used in a logical IF statement.<br><br><br>The following example illustrates the use of the PATH environment variable within a batch file:<br><br><pre class='sbody-pre'><br>   IF &quot;%PATH%&quot; == &quot;&quot; GOTO NOPATH<br>   :YESPATH<br>   @ECHO The PATH environment variable was detected.<br>   PATH=C:\DOS;%PATH%<br>   GOTO END<br>   :NOPATH<br>   @ECHO The PATH environment variable was NOT detected.<br>   PATH=C:\DOS;<br>   GOTO END<br>   :END<br> </pre>This example tests for the existence of the PATH variable. If it exists, control passes to the YESPATH section; otherwise, control is passed to the NOPATH section.<br><br><br>If a path is detected and control is passed to the YESPATH section, C:\DOS is added to the existing path by using the %PATH% variable.<br></div><div class='kb-securedata-section section'>6.00 6.20</div><div class='kb-textlegacy-section section'>DOC INFO: Filtered by: A-stepto RAID THEATRE: Doswinkb bug #1108 Author: herschm (1994-09-27T00:00:00) Edit Reviewer: debbief (1994-10-02T00:00:00) Tech Reviewer: debbief (1994-10-02T00:00:00)<br></div>
