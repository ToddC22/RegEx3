<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Bid management</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>A bid is the amount that an advertiser chooses to pay for a specific keyword. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Our <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/53099/0" managed-link="" target="_blank">Set your campaign budget &amp; bid amounts</a> help article contains a lot of useful information on this topic.</p>

<p><a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="">Return to top</a></p>
<a id="header1" title="header1"></a>

<h4><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a>1.1&nbsp;Bid setting&nbsp;options</h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>When an advertiser first creates a campaign, the bids entered in the last step of the process are default bids that will be used if specific bids for keywords aren&rsquo;t entered. The default is the first page bid minimum.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>In addition, advertisers will see in-context recommendations during the create new workflow for campaigns, ad groups and keywords, advising them of the additional traffic they could potentially reach if they were to increase bids via pop-up alert. Advertisers can either select&nbsp;<strong>OK </strong>or <strong>Cancel</strong> to accept/reject the suggested bid changes.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><strong><span><span><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a></span></span></strong><span><span>1.2 Automated bid strategies</span></span></span><span><span lang="EN"></span></span></h4>

<p>A variety of automated bid strategies are available to help advertisers manage their keyword bids in the way that best suits their needs. These are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Manual&nbsp;(currently being deprecated)</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Enhanced CPC</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Maximize Clicks</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Maximize Conversions</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Target CPA (TCPA)</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Target Return on Ad Spend (</span></span></span><span><span><span>ROAS)</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN"></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Automated bid strategies will bypass the budget settings in place at the campaign level. Advertisers using budget strategies to preserve budget throughout the month should be aware that using automated bid strategies may therefore use up their monthly budget before the month is over.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>Shared budgets&nbsp;are not compatible with this feature. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Although there is no minimum conversion requirement, some strategies (such as, Max. Conversions, TCPA, and TROAS) will perform significantly better with more historical conversion data from which to calculate. (There is a known issue with Editor, when creating new campaigns, which continues to display a legacy alert that a minimum number of conversions is required. We are working to remove this alert.) </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note</span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>: For Max. Conversions, TCPA, and TROAS the advertiser must still have an active conversion goal set up. TROAS also requires revenue tracking to be set up and actively pulling data. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Learning&nbsp;message</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Some automated bid strategies (for example, Max. Clicks, Max. Conversions, Target CPA, and Target ROAS) require a minimum of two weeks to learn the best bids to apply. During this time, advertisers will see delivery, but it can be slow to start. </span></span></span></span></span> </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>In the UI, we have the following alert message to call this out:<br>
<span asset="4532872" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4532872]</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Reassure advertisers who contact you about this message that this should resolve itself naturally within one to two weeks, after the system has been able to study the account performance enough to begin accurately bidding on auctions using their desired bid strategy. </span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note: </span></span></span></strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Changing the campaign budget can cause automated bid strategies to reset their learning period, as the system will need time to optimize performance against the new campaign budget, so that it learns not to exceed this target. (Unless a customer has chosen to override specific ad groups/keywords, as described in the &ldquo;Setting a Campaign&rsquo;s Bid Strategy&rdquo;<strong> </strong>section of&nbsp;</span></span></span><span lang="EN-GB"><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/56786/1" managed-link="" target="_blank">Let Microsoft Advertising manage your bids with bid strategies</a>).</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span lang="EN-GB"><span>For this reason, as a best practice we advise that customers do not make more than weekly modifications to their budget.</span></span><span lang="EN-GB"></span></span></span></p>

<h4><span><strong><span lang="EN"><span><a id="1.3" name="1.3"></a></span></span></strong></span><span><span><span><span><span>1.3 Manual bids (currently being deprecated) </span></span></span></span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Deprecation Note: </span></span></span></strong><span><span><span>As of October 2020, Manual CPC will no longer be a bid option on Expert Mode accounts that registered via SMART campaign signup. We are also opting a proportion of customers who signed up as Expert Mode into the Manual CPC deprecation pilot.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>For these customers, do not escalate to Global Support for missing Manual CPC tactics, as this is by design. Encourage customers to use <strong>Enhanced CPC</strong> instead. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Legacy advertisers may currently have the option to select <strong>Manual CPC</strong> as their Bid Strategy. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Using this method, advertisers manually select the max. bid they would like to place for each keyword in their library. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>During auction, Bing will not modify the max. bid value or exceed it.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Users can bid in three ways:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Enter a bid for all keywords.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Change the bids for individual keywords.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Estimate the bids needed for each keyword to reach average position.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>To get the most out of their budgets, advertisers should closely monitor keywords for positioning and set reports to run frequently. They&rsquo;ll want to prioritize the keywords that bring the most traffic and are most relevant to their products and services.<br>
<br>
Focusing on specific phrases and keywords, and on their demographic, will help advertisers target the right customers. For example, a business in Seattle that offers services to certain areas might use those neighborhood names as keywords, or they can try incremental bidding to improve their chances of reaching target demographics.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Enhanced CPC is a feature that automatically adjusts advertiser&#39;s bids in real time to increase the chances of a conversion.&nbsp;The bid will go&nbsp;higher on searches that are more likely to convert, and&nbsp;lower on searches that are less likely to convert. </span></p>

<p><span lang="EN">Enhanced CPC is the default bid strategy setting when you create a new campaign. Note that there is no learning period for ECPC as confirmed by Engineering.

<p><span><span><span lang="EN"><span><span>If there is no performance data in the account to base bid adjustments on (for example, new account/campaign), Bing will use historical market performance for keywords to calculate a mainline bid value.

<p><span><span> </span></span><span><span><strong><span><span>Q: Inline keyword diagnosis indicates that my keywords are below the first page and I&#39;m using auto max clicks. Why is this?</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>A: </span></span></strong><span><span>Max clicks is not currently supported by keyword inline diagnosis.&nbsp;If the keyword/s have defaulted to very low bids, we recommend that the advertiser use ECPC as a bid strategy to start off. Based on performance they can optimize campaigns and switch to automated bidding strategy (auto max clicks).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q: I have auto max clicks and would like to know if my campaigns are running or not?</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="2" name="2"></a>2. Incremental bidding</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Incremental bids can increase an ad&#39;s exposure to potential customers who meet specific targeting criteria. Increasing the overall bid makes the ad appear higher in an individual&rsquo;s search results.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The incremental bid is a percentage increase of the base bid that is applied when customers meet the target criteria and click the ad.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Because the incremental bid amount is derived from a percentage of the base bid, the incremental bid amount fluctuates when changes are made to the base bid.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>The incremental percentage amount is calculated for each targeted area:</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Location</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Days of the week</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Time of day</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Age</span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Gender</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Incremental bids are optional and bid adjustments for most variables can range, in 1% increments, from -90% to + 900%.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>As per above, negative bid adjustments for most targets can go to -90%. However, if you are using a negative bid adjustment for tablets or smartphones, you can go to -100%. Using -100% for one of these devices would effectively opt you out of displaying your ads on that device. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Default bids are established at the ad group level. Advertisers can use default bid to simplify workflow, but they may want to override default bids for specific high-performing keywords to improve ROI.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Adjustments to the default bid will not override existing bid prices.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>The incremental bid applies only when user falls within the desired audience. This incremental bid may increase the chances of appearing in a higher position for that desired audience, but it must be high enough to compete with other bidders on the same keyword.<br>
<br>
If a customer who does not match the target criteria clicks your ad, you do not pay any incremental bids. If a customer who matches more than one of your target criteria clicks your ad all the incremental bids apply as outlined below.<br>
<br>
To make it easier for you to import Google AdWords campaigns to Microsoft Advertising, and to align with industry standards, we&#39;re updating the way Microsoft Advertising calculates incremental bids when you use multiple incremental bids.<br>
<br>
Microsoft Advertising uses the industry-standard calculation method, multiplication, to combine your incremental bid adjustments.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><a id="3" name="3"></a>3. What is price estimation?</h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Price estimates use each advertiser&rsquo;s unique performance history to improve the accuracy of the predictions. Advertisers with high CTR for a keyword should bid less to reach position one&nbsp;than advertisers with low CTR. Performance predictions also benefit from the higher data granularity.<br>
<br>
If an advertiser is based in one country and is focusing advertising efforts in another, the price estimation tool will compare data from any competitors in his target market, not just the competitors using the same currency. For example, if the advertiser is based in the <span><span><span><span>US</span></span></span></span> and advertises in the UK, the price estimation tool will compare data across advertisers who advertise in the UK, perform back-end currency conversions and deliver price estimations in USD. The price estimate to reach first position does not take into consideration any extra incremental bid an advertiser may have placed to reach targeted users.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<span><span><span><strong>Note: </strong>A notification will appear if a default keyword or ad group bid exceeds the advertiser&#39;s daily target budget.</span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="4.4" name="4.4"></a>4.4 Keywords tab - Price Estimation</h4>

<p><strong>Customer facing? </strong>Yes</p>

<p><strong>How to use:</strong></p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Data source:</strong> Examines historical and current Microsoft Advertising performance, recommends a bid to reach a desired position. Determines minimum suggested bid value of one or more keywords (by keyword ID) that could result in an ad appearing in targeted position:&nbsp;best, mainline, bottom of page and sidebar (in markets still supporting this feature) in search results.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>When to use:</strong> Depends on future market conditions. No guarantee that estimated bids will place ad in estimated position. Use when you know exactly what position is desired. Best used when the keyword is already in the account and has historical performance.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>How does account age affect bids:</strong> Takes into account the advertiser&#39;s historical performance on a given keyword. As a rule, the more performance an advertiser has on a given keyword, the more accurate the bids estimate.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Advantages:</strong> Gives a more accurate bid estimation for keywords already in the account with performance history.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Limitations:</strong> Does not look at auction dynamics, such as other advertisers bidding on the same terms.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>When to use:</strong> A good place to get bid optimizations for new keywords or keywords without a lot of history. Bids and CPCs represent an aggregation of entire Microsoft Advertising marketplace for a keyword. Can provide guidance on what a new advertiser should expect to pay and the bids of other advertisers.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>How does account age affect bids:</strong> Advertiser/account dynamics are not considered.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Advantages:</strong> Uses past auction performance by all advertisers bidding on a term to give an &quot;initial&quot; directional estimate of what advertiser should bid. This is based on auction history.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Limitations:</strong> Auction dynamics change month-to-month. Revisit bids after a month.</p>

<p class="indent-1">When someone clicks an ad, the actual cost per click is deducted from the campaign budget. The actual cost per click for each keyword varies based on the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li class="indent-1"><strong>The bid on a keyword.</strong> When not using incremental bids, the keyword bid is the maximum amount an advertiser can be charged for a click.</li>
	<li class="indent-1"><strong>Other advertisers&#39; bids for the same keyword.</strong> In online advertising, advertisers pay just $.01 more than the next-highest bidder, all other factors being equal. As a result, they could possibly pay less than the bid amount. (Microsoft Advertising does not disclose what other advertisers are bidding.)</li>
	<li class="indent-1"><strong>Incremental bids to target customers by time of day, gender, or other target criteria.</strong> If a customer who matches one or more of an advertiser&rsquo;s target criteria clicks an ad, the advertiser also pays the amount of the corresponding&nbsp;incremental bids, see <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://help.ads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/ext51004/-1/en" managed-link="" target="_blank">How to target my customers by adjusting my bids</a> for more information.</li>
	<li class="indent-1"><strong>Note on how incremental bids are calculated: </strong>Previously, if advertisers used multiple incremental bids, those adjustments were added together if a searcher met more than one of the criteria. Now, Microsoft Advertising uses the industry-standard calculation method, multiplication, to combine incremental bid adjustments.</li>
