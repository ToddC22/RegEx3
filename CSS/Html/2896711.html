<h3><span><span><span><span><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Overview</span></span></span></span></h3>

<p><span><span><span><span>Customers may run into issues when completing their transactions if they are declined. </span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><br>
The reasons for a transaction to be declined include:</span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Scenario 1</span></span></strong><span><span>: Microsoft flags the transaction as a potential risk and blocks the purchase, order, or device registration as &ldquo;Risk Rejected.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Scenario 2</span></span></strong><span><span>: The customer&rsquo;s financial institution declines the transaction.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><strong><span><span>Scenario 3</span></span></strong><span><span>: There is an account violation on the Microsoft account.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span>This article covers the first two scenarios (1 &amp; 2). For scenario 3, check the <strong>Additional resources</strong> <span><a bookmark-id="3" href="#3" managed-link="">section 3</a> </span></span></span></span><span lang="ET"> </span><span><span><span>of this article.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span><span>Note:</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> Never tell a customer that their transaction did not work due to &ldquo;fraud&rdquo; or &ldquo;risk&rdquo;. Instead, you can tell the customer that the transaction has been declined. Scripting guidance is provided within this article. </span></span></span></span></p>

<h3><span>2. Procedures</span></h3>

<h4><a id="2.1" name="2.1"></a>2.1&nbsp;Review the order for Risk Reasons</h4>

<p>In determining if a transaction requires further review by Risk Ops, follow the steps below to review the customer&rsquo;s purchase or order for Risk Reasons.</p>

<p><span><span><span>If you encounter a <strong>Risk Reject error</strong> when attempting to register a customer&rsquo;s device serial number (Xbox, Surface) against a Microsoft account, skip to <a bookmark-id="2.2" href="#2.2" managed-link=""><span>section 2.2</span></a></span></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1">1. Ensure the correct Microsoft account used to purchase a product or service is verified following KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/4506610" managed-link="" target="_blank">4506610&nbsp;Procedure: Microsoft account verification</a>.</p>

<p class="indent-1">2. You will find information regarding Risk alerts in two areas within MST:</p>

<p class="indent-2">a. <strong>Alerts</strong> &gt; <strong>Risks</strong>: Expand the section. This will display some high-level account risks that have occurred on the account.</p>

<p class="indent-2">&nbsp;<span asset="4468916" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4468916]</span></p>

<p class="indent-2">b. <strong>Orders</strong> &gt; <strong>Risk Status</strong>: This has risk information specifically related to an order or line item. If inquiring about an order more than 90 days old, you will need to search for the order using a date range by selecting <strong>view all</strong>.</p>

<p class="indent-2">&nbsp;<span asset="4468915" contenteditable="false" props="{&quot;size&quot;:&quot;full&quot;}" unselectable="on">[Asset 4468915]</span></p>

<p class="indent-1">3. Go to the <strong>Orders</strong> section. Under <strong>Order State</strong>, look for <strong>RiskRejected </strong>or <strong>CheckingOut</strong>. Click on the down arrow to expand the entry.</p>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Note</strong>: If a <strong>RiskRejected</strong> or <strong>CheckingOut</strong> entry does not exist, review <span><a bookmark-id="2.3" href="#2.3" managed-link="">section 2.3</a> </span><span><span> </span></span>scenarios 1 or 2. Proceed to next step as appropriate.</p>

<p class="indent-1">4. Review the <strong>Risk Status</strong> tab of the specific transaction. Check the <strong>Reason Code</strong> for any additional instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>5.

If the transaction displays <strong>Risk Rejected</strong>, it is generally appropriate to engage Risk Ops. </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><br>
The <strong>Reason Code </strong>provides next steps guidance and may indicate &ldquo;Follow normal procedures for review&rdquo; or <em>&ldquo;If risk declined, please escalate to RiskOps for investigation&rdquo;</em> when appropriate to engage RiskOps. Make sure not to miss any conditional statements (for example, must meet time requirements in some instances before escalating).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>6. Relay to the customer that you are having a specialist review the transaction and that you will provide a resolution back to the customer once a resolution is available. Do NOT disclose to the customer their transaction was rejected by the RiskOps team.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h4><a id="2.6" name="2.6"></a>2.6 Customer disagrees with outcome of recent escalation / discussing review logic with the customer</h4>
</div>

<p>If a customer was recently escalated for risk rejection but disagrees with the outcome of the escalation (for example, Risk Rejection upheld), they may seek additional information.</p>

<p>Due to the sensitive nature of methods used to review financial transactions, it is important to avoid speculation when discussing why any given transaction or payment instrument was not authorized.</p>

<p>Follow these rules:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Any information not clearly indicated by Risk Ops for communicating with the customer should be considered restricted information and should not be discussed.</li>
	<li><span><span><span>If you are unsure whether a certain piece of information can be discussed, review the resolution provided by Risk Ops carefully. If you need further clarity, consult your Tech Lead or SME.</span></span></span></li>
