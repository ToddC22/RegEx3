<h3><strong><a id="Overview" name="Overview"></a>Overview</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Modern Commerce &ndash; Partner Led</strong> is the third phase of the Modern Commerce platform rollout. This phase is targeted at existing and new Cloud Solution Providers (CSPs) and Partners.</p>

<p>Partners will be required to sign a new Microsoft Partner Agreement (MPA). More information on the agreement is available in the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:b:/r/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/CL-Microsoft-Partner-Agreement-FAQ-Internal.pdf?csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=FGQhHh" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Partner Agreement for Cloud Solution Provider Partners</a> document.</p>

<p>After signing the new MPA, Partners can transition their customers to the Modern platform using Partner Center and APIs. Partners can also onboard new customers to the Modern Commerce platform using Partner Center. Partners will receive monthly invoices for their customers in their Billing Profile.</p>

<p>In Modern Partner Led, there are two types of Partners:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Tier One&nbsp;(T1)</strong> &ndash; T1 Partners who directly interact with customers to provide billing, technical support, and service administration.</li>
	<li><strong>Tier Two (T2)</strong> &ndash; Partners who purchase services from T1 Partners which they resell to end customers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Partners are supported using the Commerce Support Tool (CST). More information is available in the CST user guide (<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4487922" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 4487922</a>).</p>

<p>For more information on distinguishing Partners in CST, see the <a bookmark-id="How to Distinguish Partners in CST" href="#How to Distinguish Partners in CST" managed-link=""><em>How to Distinguish Partners in CST</em></a> scenario.</p>

<p>The customer experience of signing up, upgrading, and Cost Management + Billing can be seen in the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/teams/ASMS/ASMS%20Community%20Documents/VKBDocs/Modern-Partner-Billing-Experience-v2.pptx?d=wfc316c64736a407ea5285dc0fafa9df3&amp;csf=1&amp;web=1&amp;e=1vYmQ2" managed-link="" target="_blank">Modern Partner Billing Experience</a> presentation.</p>

<p>Partners receive one invoice per billing profile, separated by customers on the PDF. The experience is identical to Customer Led and Field Led, with two notable exceptions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>Invoice Sections</strong> blade has been renamed to <strong>Customers</strong>.

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li>Customers are set up as Invoice Sections for each Billing Group the Publisher maintains. The functionality is identical to Invoice Sections.</li>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This workflow is like&nbsp;a Billing Ownership Transfer request.</p>

<ol>
	<li>The new partner creates a relationship with a customer in Partner Center following the steps outlined in the customer-facing <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/add-a-new-customer" managed-link="" target="_blank">How to add a new customer record in Partner Center</a> page.

	<ul>
		<li>This operation creates an Azure Plan for that customer and provides the Partner access to the end customer&rsquo;s tenant.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The new partner initiates a Billing Ownership Transfer request in Partner Center with the information of the source partner provided by the end customer.
	<ul>
		<li>The request is active for 30 days.</li>
		<li>The new partner can check the status of transfer requests in Partner Center while in the context of their end customer.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The source partner will receive a Billing Ownership Transfer request email.
	<ul>
		<li>This email includes a link to Partner Center and provides the source partner a list of eligible subscriptions to transfer to the destination partner.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The source partner selects the subscriptions to transfer with inputs from the end customer. After the transfer request is approved, the transfer of Billing Ownership of selected subscriptions is immediately initiated.
	<ul>
		<li>The source partner is responsible for all purchases <strong>up to</strong> the point of transfer.</li>
		<li>The destination partner is responsible for all purchases <strong>after</strong> the point of transfer.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>After the transfer is complete, the destination partner will see the transferred subscriptions in Partner Center. With the proper level of access, they can administer and purchase services under those subscriptions.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Requirements:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The Partner must be an Azure Expert Managed Services Provider (MSP).
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">

	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The source subscription must be an EA subscription.</li>
	<li>This transfer is self-serve only.</li>
	<li>Until Partner Led Dev/Test subscriptions are introduced, EA Dev/Test (148P) subscriptions will be converted to a standard (17G) subscription and will not benefit from Dev/Test pricing.</li>
	<li>The Partner must have a destination <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://www.microsoftazurepass.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure Access Pass</a> set up.</li>
	<li>SaaS, Reserved Instance (RI), and Marketplace Subscription assets will not transfer and must be cancelled in the source then rebought in the destination.</li>
</ul>

<p><span>Partner Led partners use self-service functionality documented at </span><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/mpa-request-ownership" target="_blank"><span>Billing Ownership request functionality</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>Microsoft has restricted access to the Direct EA to CSP Transfer tool for all S500 (strategic) customers <em>and</em> customers consuming more than $1M of Azure Container Registry (ACR) per year. This was done to ensure that EA customers fully understand the implications of losing their EA benefits if they transfer their Direct EA Azure subscriptions to CSP.</p>

<p>When a Partner attempts to invite a customer in this category to transition to CSP through the tool, the Partner receives an error message requesting additional approvals. While we advise Partners against having these customers transfer to CSP, Pro Direct Managers can initiate a process on behalf of Partners and customers to secure approval for CSP transfers through the tool.</p>

<p>The approval process is as follows:</p>

<ol>
	<li>The end customer, Partner, and end customer Account Team must discuss the limitations described in the <span>Customer Checklist </span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span>slide.</li>
	<li>The end customer, Partner, and end customer Account Team must provide written confirmation of their agreement to move to CSP despite the known limitations.</li>
	<li><span> The Partner </span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span>must submit an approval form to the Partner Business Desk conveying the decision to transfer to CSP, or <span>engage the Partner Business </span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span>Desk for an EA Outsourcer Enrollment alternative.
	<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
		<li>Email <a href="mailto:cspmgr@microsoft.com" target="_blank"><span>cspmgr@microsoft.com</span></a> and ask for a copy of the request form.</li>
		<li>Submit the completed form with e-mail approvals to the Partner Business Desk on the <a href="https://wwlpbdcrm.microsoftcrmportals.com">Business Desk 360 CRM Tool</a> page.</li>

<p>To provide a single combined invoice for managed services and Azure consumption, a CSP&nbsp;can take over billing ownership of Azure subscriptions from their customers with Direct EAs. Additional guidance can be found in the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/mpa-request-ownership">public-facing documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Currently, Azure does not support Indirect EA enrollments&nbsp; for transferring Billing Ownership to CSP.<br>

<p><span><span><span>As part of Partner Led to Partner Led Transition, Microsoft is enabling a capability within Partner Center to transfer Azure plans between partners. For the context of this scenario, the <em>target partner</em> is the one who is gaining business from the customer and <em>source partner</em> is the one losing business.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: Microsoft is not an active party to the agreement between the customer and the source partner. Microsoft also, has no knowledge of the contents of the agreement between the customer and the source partner. It is not appropriate for Microsoft to get involved in any dispute between the two parties of the agreement. Instead the following should occur:</span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The customer should refer to the relevant cancellation terms in their agreement&nbsp;and work with the source partner to cancel their agreement in alignment with those terms.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If for whatever reason the source partner is not cooperative or responsive, and the customer feels the source partner is not honoring the (cancellation) terms of their agreement, they should leverage any relevant dispute resolution options available to them per the terms of their agreement.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Should a target partner escalate a situation where the source partner is not acknowledging the customer transfer request, do the following: </span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Provide the details mentioned above to the target partner. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Send an &quot;FYI&quot; email to <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="mailto:cspmgr@microsoft.com" managed-link="" target="_blank">Azure CSP Migration alias (OCP)</a> in response to the escalation.

	<ol start="1" style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
