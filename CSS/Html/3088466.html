<h3><span class="text-base"><a id="1" name="1"></a></span>1.&nbsp;Introduction</h3>

<p class="ng-scope"><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Microsoft family is just one of the many benefits of having a Microsoft account. It&rsquo;s a free service that helps families stay connected and keep kids safer on Windows 10 and Xbox One devices with features like activity reporting, screen time limits, and content restrictions. You&rsquo;ll find these settings on&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://family.microsoft.com/" managed-link="" target="_blank">family.microsoft.com</a>, where you can also track kids&rsquo; spending and add money to their Microsoft accounts.</span></span></span></p>

<p class="ng-scope"><span lang="EN-GB"></span></p>

<p><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span><span>Read more at&nbsp;<a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/12413/microsoft-account-what-is-family" managed-link="" target="_blank">https://support.microsoft.com/help/12413/microsoft-account-what-is-family</a>.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span lang="EN-GB"><span><span>Note for child local account on Windows 7 and Windows 8:</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Starting January 29<sup>th</sup>, 2020, we will no longer support showing activity or managing settings for child local accounts using Windows 7 and Windows 8 computers on account.microsoft.com. For both operating systems there will still be a path for parents to use parental controls or update, setup as below. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Windows 7: </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Current setting will stay in place but no changes can be made. In order to user family safety settings on Windows 7 devices, uninstall Windows Live Family Safety, and use the Parental Controls control panel to set the limits and see activity reports. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Windows 8.1: </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Current setting will stay in place but no changes can be made. In order to use family settings on Windows 8 devices, follow below steps. </span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span>Open <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>On each child account, change them from <strong>Child </strong>to <strong>Standard Users</strong>. This will disconnect their device from our online features.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Once you&rsquo;ve changed all accounts to <strong>Standard Users</strong>, you&rsquo;re able to move them back to <strong>Child</strong> to keep using family safety settings on the device.</span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>User Accounts and Family Safety</strong> &gt; <strong>Parental Controls</strong> to make any changes. </span></span></span></li>
