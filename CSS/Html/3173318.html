<h3><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Inquiries from cardholders</h3>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Determine whether the cardholder is suggesting their card was stolen, or if the caller is raising an account billing dispute. If the cardholder is the account owner, refer to KB <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/help/3173012" managed-link="" target="_blank">3173012 Process: Microsoft Advertising: Credits, Refunds, &amp; Rebills</a>.</span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>Is the caller the account holder?</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Did an authorized user of the card create the account on the cardholder&rsquo;s behalf?</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Does the cardholder own a business that advertises with Microsoft Advertising? </span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Attempt to locate any accounts that may be using the card using the following methods:</span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>Cardholder name as username (use partial search for better results).</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Business name as either account or customer name.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Business URL reverse lookup in AdInquiry.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>For any identified accounts using the card, attempt to authenticate and reconfirm that the card was stolen or if this is an issue of a billing dispute because of unexpected charges. </span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: Do not divulge any account-specific information to the cardholder without strong authentication using the authentication/fortification process. Specify in the ticket notes whether you were able to authenticate the caller or not.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If you can determine that the cardholder does not have a Microsoft Advertising account, escalate to the fraud team using the unknown charges template. Include the following information:</span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>If the caller is willing to provide a copy of their credit card statement, any personally identifiable information should be removed by the caller before submitting. The copy/screenshot should include:</span></span></span></span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li><span><span><span><span>Transaction reference numbers for the charges in question.</span></span></span></span></li>
			<li><span><span><span><span>Values of the suspicious charges.</span></span></span></span></li>
			<li><span><span><span><span>Dates of the suspicious charges.</span></span></span></span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: Information from the account should not be used to complete the issue-specific details in this scenario outside of sharing the XID (if known). If you know the account number associated to the stolen charges, pause all campaigns. Do not delete them, as this may hinder a fraud investigation.</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>Set expectations with the customer that this investigation could take up to two business days.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Use the instructions below to determine your next step based on the outcome of the investigation:</span></span></span></span>

<p class="indent-2"><span></span><span><span><em><span><span>&ldquo;Thank you for your patience as we investigated further your request to have charges removed. At this point, we believe the charges are valid. If you were not aware of this account activity, you may wish to check with anyone else who may have access to this credit card. In the meantime, we have paused your campaign(s) to avoid accruing additional charges. You may log in to your Microsoft Advertising account and resume your campaign(s) at any time once you feel your account information is set up properly.</span></span></em></span></span><span><span><em><span><span><br>
Please be advised that because we have determined that the charges are valid, you will still be billed for charges that have been accrued up to this point.<br>
<br>
If you feel that we have reached this conclusion in error, please respond to this email with additional information you feel is relevant for our reconsideration.<br>
<br>
Once we receive this information, we will conduct an additional review and get back to you within 2-3 business days. Please note that the decision we make after a second review is final and cannot be appealed further.<br>

Charges to other cards in the same account may have already been reported and reversed through the other cardholders&#39; banks as chargebacks. If credit memos for charges on a stolen card are declined, advise the caller to dispute the charges through their bank.</span></span></span></span></li>
