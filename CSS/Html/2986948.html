ATTR46 is a corner case where sending MTA did not bifurcate mail to different recipient domains and is sending it to O365 as is. In this case, we are already attributing the mail as incoming to a specific domain which is a tenant and some of the recipients are not on the same domain (even if part of the same tenant). As a result, only the recipients on different domains are deferred temporarily which SHOULD cause the sending mail server to retry the mail only to them on the next retry as per SMTP RFC.</span></p>

			<td>
			<p dir="ltr"><span>We expect then they would be delivered accordingly on subsequent retries. You could investigate why sending mail server did not bifurcate the mail in the first place and create an escalation to bring this case to Engineering&rsquo;s attention.</span></p>

			<p dir="ltr"><span>However, if the mail here was supposed to be attributed as originating from a known tenant, please work with the customer and investigate why the email was not recognized as originating from the sending tenant.

			&lrm;</span> <span>The recipient email address is an x400 address, which isn&#39;t used by the Office 365 service. You might see this error if you&#39;ve migrated from on-premises to the cloud, or if your organization has a hybrid configuration and you synchronize your on-premises directory with Office 365. If clearing the recipient AutoComplete cache from the user&#39;s Outlook or Outlook Web App client doesn&#39;t solve the problem, try to clear the related LegacyExchangeDN address from your on-premises Active Directory by using the&nbsp;</span> <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=19034"> <span> <span> <u>LegacyExchangeDN Utility</u> <u> </u></span></span></a> <span><br>
			&lrm;</span> <span><br>
			&lrm;</span> <span>Then re-synch the directory.</span> <span><br>
