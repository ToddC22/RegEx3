<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>What does the Office 365 ProPlus benefit mean exactly? </strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> There are now two options to provide Office 365 ProPlus benefit in education:   </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>1) I</span></span></span>nstitution-led Office 365 ProPlus benefit: Your organization&rsquo;s IT staff creates an Office 365 Education tenant (domain, such as @SCHOOL.edu, anyone from the University taking part in the ProPlus benefit program), obtains Office 365 ProPlus licenses from a reseller, assigns these licenses to your students, faculty, and staff in the tenant (populated via Dirsync, etc) via Powershell or GRAPH API (see&nbsp;<a href="http://aka.ms/licensescript" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;for sample scripts), and then individuals download Office 365 ProPlus&nbsp;<a href="http://aka.ms/getoffice" target="_blank">here</a>&nbsp;and log into Office for valid usage<span><span><span>.  </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Or   </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><em><span><span></span></span></em>2) Sign up yourself Office 365 ProPlus benefit: Customers without Office 365 Education tenants can provide students an option to obtain Office 365 ProPlus without having IT setup a tenant, without having to obtain licenses from a reseller, and without IT having to assign Office 365 ProPlus licenses to users.  Existing Office 365 Education tenants can also use sign up yourself for auto-account creation and/or auto-assignment of Office 365 ProPlus licenses to users for easier enablement<span><span><span>. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>What are the requirements for the Sign up yourself Office 365 ProPlus benefit to work with auto-account creation and auto-license assignment? </strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> There are four requirements:   </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Student must have an academic email to validate they are a student. Student will sign up using their academic email. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Institution must be eligible for Office 365 ProPlus </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Student must be age 13 or over. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;No ADFS for federated login with their Office 365 Education tenant and the need for auto-account creation. When using the &lsquo;Sign up yourself&rsquo; option, the auto-account create portion does not work with federated logins to Office 365 Education; however, the <strong>sign up yourself</strong> auto-license assignment portion does work with federated logins. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>What are the requirements for the Sign up yourself Office 365 ProPlus benefit to work with just auto-license assignment with existing Office 365 accounts? </strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> There are two requirements:   </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;Institution must be eligible for the Office 365 ProPlus benefit. </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;User has a valid login for Office 365 Education to use with the Sign Up Yourself link.  </span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span> -  Administrators can also obtain a pool of Office 365 ProPlus benefit licenses using Sign Up Yourself feature.  This account would be used to obtain the Office 365 ProPlus pool of licenses for auto-assignment to the users inside of an existing Office 365 Education tenant for scenarios when no academic email exists or under-13 scenarios. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>How long can a student leverage Office 365 ProPlus? </strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A: </strong>They can leverage this until they graduate or are no longer attending your school. At that point, you must disable their Office 365 ProPlus license.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>How many machines/devices can I run this subscription on? </strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Each subscription license allows you to run Office on up to five machines, Mac or PC. You can also run Office for iPad on up to 5 tablets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong><span><span>What if an Admin contacts me?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> If Admins contact us, they should be directed to log in to the admin portal (portal.office.com) where they can submit a support ticket via the support section of the portal.

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong><span><span>What does Office A1 Plus for Students include?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span><br>
<strong>A:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Office 365 ProPlus allows students to install the latest version of Office on up to 5 PCs or Macs* and on other mobile devices, including Windows tablets and iPads.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><span><span>Office for the web</span></span></span></span><span><span><span>: Word, Excel, and PowerPoint</span></span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>1 TB of OneDrive for Business storage, managed by the school, for schoolwork and homework.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>SharePoint Online<br>
	<br>
	*Outlook, Access, and Publisher are available on PC&#39;s only.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>The Office 365 Education for Students subscription is valid for one year from the sign-up date. If the tenant (domain, such as @school.edu and anyone from the University taking part in the ProPlus benefit program) is managed by an IT administrator, they can choose to extend that license period.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>Who can enroll?</strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Schools qualify for this benefit when they license Office institution-wide for faculty and staff through Enrollment for Education Solutions (EES), Open Value Subscription Education Solutions (OVS-ES), or a school contract, and they are enrolled to allow students to sign up directly with Microsoft. After the school qualifies, its active full-time or part-time students are eligible and they can get the plan directly from Microsoft at </span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://www.microsoft.com/education/ww/studentadvantage/pages/default.aspx" managed-link="" target="_blank">Office.com/GetOffice365</a> </span><span>if they meet all three of the following requirements:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>They have a school-specific email address provided by the school (for example, contoso.edu) that can receive external email.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>They are of legal age to sign up for an online offer individually (13 years old).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>They have Internet access.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span><span><span>Students will not be able to sign up if:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Their educational institution does not currently participate in the ProPlus benefit program.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The Student does not have an email address with the education institute.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Students have been blocked from joining; either by default or by choice of the school.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Students are under the age of 13.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong>What&rsquo;s new since ProPlus benefit launched in December&nbsp;2013?</strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> It is important to understand that Office 365 Education for Students has been available to eligible students for some time, but has previously required the IT administrator of the school to setup and assign the appropriate license to their students. Beginning 17 September 2014, the student sign-up capability removes the need for the IT administrator to be involved in the setup and provisioning of eligible students.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong><span><span>Are there any regional restrictions?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
<strong>A:</strong> Asia: In China, Office ProPlus benefit is not yet available; therefore students in China will not be able to take advantage of the student sign-up capability at launch.<br>
<br>
EMEA: In the European Union (EU), some additional restrictions are applied to the student sign-up experience:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Students who already have an Office 365 account will be able to sign-up for Office 365 Education for Students by default.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Students who do not already have an Office 365 account and where there is no tenant already associated to the school domain will be able to sign-up for Office 365 Education for Students by default.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Students who do not already have an Office 365 account and where an existing tenant is already associated to the school domain, the student will not be able to sign-up for Office 365 Education for Students by default.</span></span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>This feature can be manually enabled by their school IT administrator. This can be done via a PowerShell script. See the Enabling and Disabling Student Sign-up section for details. This limitation is required for Microsoft to remain compliant with regional and local regulatory requirements.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><strong><span><span>Q:</span></span></strong><span><span>&nbsp;<strong><span><span>Isn&#39;t this the same SKU as Office 365 University?</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span><br>
