<h4><strong>Processing Misapplied Payments</strong></h4>

<p><span lang="EN-IN"><span><span>In some instances</span></span></span><span lang="EN-IN"><span><span>,</span></span></span> customers may submit multiple invoice payments via one wire transfer. In return, this may cause misapplied payments by the Global Financial Services (GFS) team (due to lack of invoice numbers associated with the transfers). In these instances, ASMS should do the following to assist the customer.</p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Validate that the customer routed the payment to the correct Microsoft account. </span></span></strong><span><span>For a list of Microsoft Wire Transfer Account and Payment Addresses, refer to TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658076">2658076</a>.<strong> </strong></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Escalate to GFS following the <em>Payment inquiry</em> guidelines outlined in TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2647567/azure-support-commerce-teams-engagement-cbo-and-wocs">2647567</a>.</span></span></strong></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>Inform the customer of their invoicing date (if they are unclear how invoice mode of payment works).</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><span><span>If the customer did not route their payment to the correct Microsoft Account, explain that the payment will need to be located. Once located, it will be applied immediately to the balance due. However, if the payment is not located before the invoice date, the payment may not be applied to the next invoice.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span>Note</span></span></strong><span><span>: The GFS team will work with Cash Operations to locate the payment. As appropriate, they will then notify the Collections team to &ldquo;pull&rdquo; the affected client from the dunning process to prevent dunning notifications being sent to the customer while Cash Applications investigates. When the payment is found, the Cash Application Team will transfer the money into the correct MS internal IO account and clear customer&rsquo;s invoices on the account.</span></span></span></p>

<ol start="3">
	<li><span><span><strong><span><span>Once GFS has provided next steps, update the customer accordingly. </span></span></strong></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span>Provide the customer with the proper account information for their next payment (See TSG <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2658076">2658076</a>).</span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span>You can also educate the customer that in the future they can email <a href="mailto:wocs-na@microsoft.com">wocs-na@microsoft.com</a> and include the below information to inquire about submitted invoice payments.</span></span>
		<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
			<li><span><span>Amount paid for each invoice</span></span></li>
			<li><span><span>Check number</span></span></li>
			<li><span><span>Date Sent</span></span></li>
			<li><span><span>Invoice numbers / details</span></span></li>
			<li><span><span>Remittance Address</span></span></li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p class="indent-1"><span><strong><span><span>Note:</span></span></strong><span><span> You should also inform the customer that if they do not receive a response from <a href="mailto:wocs-na@microsoft.com">wocs-na@microsoft.com</a> they can reach out to Support and we will assist them further.</span></span></span></p>
