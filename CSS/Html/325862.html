You can install operating systems on remote boot-enabled client computers. Client computers are connected to the network, and are then started by using a Pre-Boot eXecution Environment (PXE)-capable network adapter or remote boot disk. The client then logs on with a valid user account.<br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='3'></a>RIS Hardware Requirements</h3> The following is the minimum hardware that is required for the RIS server: <br> <ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>The server must meet the minimum hardware requirements for the version of Windows Server 2003 that is installed.</li><li>A four gigabyte (GB) drive that is dedicated to the RIS directory tree on the RIS server.</li><li>A 10 or 100 megabit per second (Mbps) network adapter that supports TCP/IP. 100 Mbps is preferred.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: Dedicate a whole hard disk or partition specifically to the RIS directory tree. SCSI-based disk controllers and disks are preferred.<br><br>The drive on the server on which you will install RIS must be formatted with the NTFS file system. RIS requires a lot of disk space, and you cannot install it on the same drive or partition on which Windows Server 2003 is installed. Make sure that the chosen drive contains enough free disk space for at least one full set of the installation files for the operating system you plan to remotely install.</li></ul><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='4'></a>Client Hardware Requirements</h3> The following list describes the minimum hardware that is required for RIS client computers: <br> <ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Meet the minimum operating system hardware requirements.<br></li><li>PXE DHCP-based boot ROM version 1.00 or later network adapter, or a network adaptor that is supported by the RIS boot disk.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: Always contact the manufacturer of your network adapter to obtain the latest version of the PXE DHCP-based boot ROM.</li></ul><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='5'></a>Software Requirements</h3> Several network services must be active and available for RIS. You can install the following services either on the RIS server or on other servers that are available on the network: <br> <ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Domain Name System (DNS Service)</li><li>Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</li><li>Active Directory &quot;Directory&quot; service</li></ul><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='6'></a>Prerequisites for Client Installations</h3> Make sure that the client computer&#39;s network adapter has been set as the primary boot device in the computer BIOS. If the network adapter is configured as the primary boot device, the client requests a network service boot from the RIS server on the network when the client starts. After the client contacts the RIS, the client is prompted to press the F12 key to download the Client Installation Wizard. Do not press F12 unless you need a new operating system installation or access to maintenance and troubleshooting tools.<br><br> After the client operating system has been installed by using RIS, you can ignore the prompt to press F12 during future client computer startups. You can also reset the client BIOS so that the primary boot device is the floppy disk drive, the hard disk, or the CD-ROM drive.<br><br> To use the remote boot disk to start the installation, insert the boot disk into the floppy disk drive, and then start the client computer. The floppy disk drive must be set as the primary boot device in the client BIOS. After the computer starts from the disk, you are prompted to press F12 to start the network service boot process. You must remove the boot disk after you press F12 and before the text-mode portion of the operating system installation completes.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: You may have to press F12 on some Compaq computers during startup. In this case, you must press F12 on the Compaq startup screen, and then press F12 again when you are prompted by the RIS server.<br><br><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='7'></a>Install Windows Server 2003 RIS</h3><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Control Panel</span>, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Add or Remove Programs</strong>.<br></li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Add/Remove Windows Components</span>. </li><li>Click to select the <span class='text-base'>Remote Installation Services</span> check box, and then click <span class='text-base'>Next</span>.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: If you are prompted for the Windows Server 2003 installation files, put the Windows Server 2003 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.

Authorization determines control of which RIS servers can serve client computers on the network. If the RIS server is not authorized in Active Directory, client computers that request service cannot contact the RIS server.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: To authorize a RIS server in Active Directory, you must be logged on as an enterprise administrator or a domain administrator of the root domain. <br> <ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Administrative Tools</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>DHCP</span>.</li><li>In the left pane, right-click <span class='text-base'>DHCP</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Manage Authorized Servers</span>. </li><li>If your server is not listed, click <span class='text-base'>Authorize</span>, type the name or the IP address of the RIS server, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.<br><br><span class='text-base'>NOTE</span>: If you are prompted to confirm the RIS server, verify the name and IP address, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.</li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Close</span>, and then quit the DHCP console.</li></ol><h3 class='sbody-h3'><a class='bookmark' id='10'></a>Set User Permissions</h3> With RIS, clients can install their own client operating system.
