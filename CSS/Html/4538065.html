<h3><strong><a id="1" name="1"></a>1. Summary</strong></h3>

<p>Microsoft Partner Center is home to more than 300,000 partners. These include partners from small, medium and large companies. Many of these companies get acquired or merge into one another as part of the changing business landscapes. The legacy system (PMC) shows that every month 30-50 companies merge into one another. As we move into Partner Center as a one-stop place for Partners, it is imperative that Account Mergers as a feature is made available in Partner Center to support the changing business of our MPN partners.&nbsp;This feature is scheduled to be live in Q3 of FY20.</p>

<h3><strong><a id="6" name="6"></a>6. Understand the impacts to programs and benefits when partners elect to merge accounts</strong></h3>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>All existing competencies (Gold/Silver), purchases (such as Microsoft Action Pack), and associated benefits are preserved during consolidation. If both companies have the same competency but one&#39;s is gold and the other silver, the competency with highest proficiency level will be awarded, and partners will have one set of silver benefits and one set of gold benefits for that competency until their next renewal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Later anniversary date for Microsoft Action Pack will be retained after the merger. For example, if the company 1&rsquo;s anniversary date for Action Pack renewal is June 2020, and company 2&rsquo;s anniversary date for Action Pack renewal for is October 2020, Microsoft will use the October 2020 date as the new anniversary date for the merged company.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>During the account merger and until your next renewal, each account will retain their Action Pack and/or competency benefits. At renewal, standard Action Pack and competency renewal rules apply.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Upon renewal, benefits that are included with competency attainment and Action Pack are implemented for the partner company&rsquo;s partner global account:</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>&bull; Microsoft Action Pack: The partner company will be able to purchase one Action Pack per partner global account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p class="indent-1"><span><span><span><span><span>&bull; Competency: The partner company will receive one package of core benefits, associated to their highest attainment, plus competency-specific benefits the partner is eligible for per partner global account.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>All benefits are subject to the <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://aka.ms/partner-benefits-use-guide" managed-link="" target="_blank">Microsoft Partner Network benefits usage guide</a>. For example: an activated O365 E3 token is functional for twelve (12) months after activation. Once a token has been activated for seats on a tenant, those seats may not be moved to another tenant.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>The MCP ID associations for both companies will be retained and associated with the PGA MPN ID.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>Go-to-market and technical benefits are offered as competency core benefit. Post-merge, it is recommended that you check your bank and tax information to ensure accuracy.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If your company is in the Azure Expert MSP program, benefits are retained until renewal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span><span>If your company has earned advanced specializations, they are retained across both accounts.</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Any software assurance vouchers are retained across both accounts.</span></span></span></span></li>
