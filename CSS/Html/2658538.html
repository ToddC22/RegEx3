<p>This article provides guidance on how and when support engineers (SEs) should engage the Human Intelligence Team (HIT).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This team was formerly known as the Account Research Team (ART).</p>

<p>HIT may reach out to ASMS via task to accept a case that was misrouted to them, please yank the case if a task requests you to.&nbsp;</p>

<ul style="list-style-type:disc" type="disc">
	<li>The HIT team is available 24/7 and resolves most HIT escalations within two hours. Occasionally, additional information may be required to complete the investigation, in which it may take longer than two hours. In those instances, do not submit requests for status updates if it has been less than two hours. This will only prolong the overall review.</li>
	<li>We offer immediate support for Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers, Partners, and Executive Escalations only.<br>

	<li><span>If you receive a case where there is <strong><span>no evidence of Fraud/Risk </span></strong>actions in CMAT, but you still need HIT&rsquo;s consultation (such as fraudulent cc charges, account is compromised, or error while purchasing Visual Studio), do the following: </span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>Send a Collaboration Task to the HIT team. </span></li>
		<li><span>In Service Desk, update the SAP to reflect the following: <em><span>//Azure/Subscription Management/</span></em><strong><em><span>Account Review</span></em></strong></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<p class="indent-1"><strong>Note:</strong> If you determine that you will need to engage HIT in any of the following scenarios, <strong>do not contact the customer after a task has been sent to HIT</strong>.<br>
HIT will handle all interactions after that point.</p>

<ul>
	<li><span>When communicating with the customer, it is okay to inform them that you are working with the Human Intelligence Team on their issue.<br>
	<span><strong><span>However, under no circumstances should you do the following:</span></strong> </span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
		<li><span>Tell the customer they were disabled for fraud.</span></li>
		<li><span>Add another individual to an email thread with a customer.<br>
		<strong><span>Example:</span></strong> During an investigation of unauthorized charges, the credit card owner may want to know the information of the person who used their credit card or may ask to have them added to the thread. Such a request is a violation of our privacy policy and might expose personally identifiable information (PII). In this scenario, the customer would be responsible for adding any additional people to the thread.</span></li>
		<li><span>Include HIT directly in any communications with the customer.</span></li>
		<li><span>Share any names, email addresses or phone numbers for HIT with the customer.</span></li>
		<li><span>Redirect the customer to HIT.<span> </span></span></li>
