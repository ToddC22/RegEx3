<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This TSG provides guidance on<span> </span><span> </span><span> </span>how to handle disabled subscriptions.<br>
Reasons an account may become disabled can include (but are not limited to)<span>:</span><span> </span><span> </span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The trial period ending on a Free Trial subscription.</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The customer disabling or canceling their own account from the Azure portal. </span></span></span><span> </span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The customer getting flagged and blocked by the Risk Management team.<br>
	<strong>Note: </strong>Risk Management is an internal team name. Do not share this this name with customers. </span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<h3>Policy</h3>

<p>Before reactivating a disabled subscription, obtain approval from the account administrator following the instructions in <a href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2646876" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2646876</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>Support Scenarios</strong><span><span> </span></span></h3>

<h4>Customer&rsquo;s Subscription Shows as Disabled via the Azure Portal</h4>

<p><strong>Ask your customer to provide the following:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span> Their subscription ID (If not already provided in the case details).</span></li>
	<li><span> A screenshot showing the disabled status in the portal.</span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Do the following:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Check to see if the subscription is enabled on the Commerce Platform (<span>CP</span>)</span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span><span> side by checking in CMAT.</span></span></span><br>
	<br>
	<span><span><span>If <em>Status</em>, <em>Entitlement Status</em> and <em>Fulfilment status</em> (for OMS accounts), are not all <em>Active</em>, then the issue is with the CP.

<h4><span><span>Portal Shows Subscription as Disabled, but Jarvis and CMAT/Billing Shows Subscription as Active/Enabled</span></span><span> </span></h4>

<p><strong>Ask your customer to provide the following:</strong></p>

	<li><span><span><span><span>If it&rsquo;s active and if it still shows as <em>Disabled</em> in the Azure portal, then it&rsquo;s a portal Issue. <span>You will need to engage the ASE team using </span></span></span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3093263" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 3093263</a></span></span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span> </span></span> <span><span> </span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<h4><span>Subscription Is Disabled but Customer Is Still Getting Billed</span></h4>

<p><strong>Ask your customer for the following:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Their subscription ID&nbsp;<span>(If not already provided in the case details).</span></span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Usage Summary and billing details.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Times and dates of when your customer disabled their subscription.</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Preferably in UTC.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Do the following:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Check to see if the subscription is disabled at both ends [RDFE/Billing]. If the subscription is enabled, let your customer know that the subscription hasn&rsquo;t been disabled.<br>
	In Jarvis: <strong>RDFE/Subscription Management/List Operation History for Subscription<br>
	<br>
	Note: </strong>Even if the Subscription is disabled mid-month, a bill will be generated for the entire month. Services for the subscription won&rsquo;t be billed from the day the subscription got disabled. If there is billing occurring despite being canceled in this manner, gather a Usage Report from the customer. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>If the customer is still being billed for services even after the subscription got disabled at the RDFE/Billing ends (check from the Usage Report), then this will be a Billing Validation Issue and should follow as per billing validation issues.<br>
	<br>
	<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> When verifying whether a customer&#39;s subscription is fully activated or not, you must check in CMAT <strong><span>and</span></strong> Jarvis before asking the customer to check in their portal.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>In CMAT, check that <em>Subscription Status</em>, <em>Entitlement Status</em>, and <em>Fulfillment Status</em> are all set to <strong><span>Active</span></strong>.</span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>In Jarvis, run <strong>AzureRT/Subscription Management/Get Subscription With Details</strong> to check for <em>SubscriptionStatus:Active</em>. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Unless all four statuses in CMAT and Jarvis show as <strong><span>Active</span></strong>, the subscription should not be considered fully active.</span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><span>Subscription Disabled Due to 3rd Party VM on Benefit Subscription</span></h4>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span><span><span><span>Benefit subscriptions (MSDN, BizSpark, etc.) can become disabled due to the deployment of 3rd party VMs (despite still having credits available).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Ask your customer for the following:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Their subscription ID <span>(If not already provided in the case details).</span></span></span></span></span></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Do the following:</strong></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>Usually, you would suspect this scenario if you notice the customer has no billing issues and has credits remaining yet still has had their account disabled on a benefit subscription.</span></span></span></span></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Pull up the subscription in CMAT.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Check if there are credits remaining and what the status of their subscription is. Normally, you will see that the spending limit has been hit despite having credits remaining.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Check to see if a credit card is attached to the subscription.<br>
	<strong>Note: </strong>Third party VMs require a credit card.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Pull up the usage report and see if the following VMs are available: <em>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</em> or <em>Oracle Software</em>. Normally, you will see the customer has deployed this VM in the last couple days before disablement.</span></span></span></span></span>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>If any of these VMs are present, your customer will need to remove their spending limit and add a credit card in order to regain immediate access. This is not a great experience for customers, so use your customer support skills to soften the language. The </span></span></span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-machines/linux/#FAQ" managed-link="" target="_blank">FAQ section of the virtual machine pricing page</a></span></span><span><span><span> also provides documentation of this behavior. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>If the customer is unable to remove the spending limit, or the services do not start (at least an hour after the spending limit has been removed), engage ASE (</span></span></span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3093263" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 3093263</a></span></span><span><span><span>) or WASU (</span></span></span><span><span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://internal.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2630659" managed-link="" target="_blank">TSG 2630659</a></span></span><span><span><span>).</span></span></span></span></span></li>

<h4><span><span>Helping Customers Recover from a Subscription Disablement</span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span><span><span> </span></span></h4>

<p><span><span><span><span>In situations where a customer&#39;s subscription has been re-enabled after having been disabled against the customers wishes, such as for non-payment, the customer may need technical assistance from Azure Support to get their services and data re-deployed. For example, the customer may need assistance re-deploying their Cloud Services (which get deleted when the subscription was disabled) or recovering their IP addresses (which get deleted unless the customer was using Reserved IPs).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Do the following:</strong></p>

<ol>
	<li><span><span><span><span><span>Gather your customer&rsquo;s case information, and get the customer routed to the correct Azure Technical Support team that can help the customer.</span></span></span></span></span>

	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><span><span><span><span><span>Engage your Technical Advisor or Partner Technical Advisor (TA or PTA) if you aren&rsquo;t sure which team your customer should be routed to. </span></span></span></span></span></li>
		<li><span><span><strong><span><span><span>Do not</span></span></span></strong><span><span><span> attempt to help the customer with their technical issues.</span></span></span></span></span></li>
