<span><strong><span><span>Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Under deceptive products and services, what is not included in the Beating Drugs Test policy?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Products for &lsquo;body cleansing&rsquo; or &lsquo;detoxification&rsquo; that are NOT marketed for the purposes of beating a drug test (but rather to purify the body etc) are allowed.</span></span></span><br>
<span><strong><span><span><br>
<a id="Q2" name="Q2"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Areas of questionable legality is a wide category. What do we mean?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>This does cover many areas and in fact we have this in place at least externally to give us a &lsquo;catch-all&rsquo;. We can choose to not accept advertising even if it is not illegal, in fact, for any reason. We reserve the right to expand or contract what content is covered under this policy at any time.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>In the US, Penny Auctions are the primary sites that are rejected under this policy area. For more information about this business model, please reference the </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://vkbexternal.partners.extranet.microsoft.com/VKBWebService/ViewContent.aspx?scid=B;EN-US;2493733" target="_blank">Penny Auctions Job Aid</a><span><span>.</span></span></span><br>

<span><strong><span><span>Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Are advertisements for </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IOS_jailbreaking" target="_blank">jailbreaking services</a><span><span><strong> </strong>allowed?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>No, but this is ONLY enforced <em><strong><span>reactively</span></strong></em>. All rejections currently in the system should be upheld.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<br>
<a id="Q4" name="Q4"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What about sites referencing fireworks, displays or content where fireworks are not sold online?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Informational sites providing descriptions of fireworks products, history or fireworks events and websites providing fireworks installation services E.g. </span></span><a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="http://melrosepyro.com/" target="_blank">http://melrosepyro.com</a><span><span> are allowed as are websites selling fireworks-related merchandise such as videos, books, apparel, fireworks displays or advertising of a physical location by a store that sells fireworks products offline.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<a id="Q5" name="Q5"></a><br>
<span><strong><span><span>Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What is a pyramid scheme?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Not all online business or money making opportunities are disallowed on Microsoft Advertising. However the below is a good way to differentiate a pyramid scheme from a valid online business opportunity. It is most probably a pyramid scheme if:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Returns (ensuing profit or gain) rely on adding participants to the scheme, where no feasible or actual product or service to sell exists. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The user pays for a low value product and through the scheme/program and is expected to benefit by receiving a product of a higher value with no further action by themselves. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>The user must pay a subscription fee or buy a specific product to join and where the value proposition of doing so is undefined (no service provided).</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><strong><span><span><a id="Q6" name="Q6"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What about landing pages that list brick and mortar (physical location) stores that sell tobacco?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Directory-type ads for stores that sell tobacco are allowed. Ads for tobacco stores are not allowed to sell any tobacco products on their website, but can refer search users to their physical location. There must be no online sale - no shipping or delivery option - for tobacco store advertisers.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<a id="Q7" name="Q7"></a><br>
<span><strong><span><span>Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What about accessories or non-tobacco products associated with smoking?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Ads for smoking accessories such as humidors or lighters are acceptable. However, the corresponding landing page and ads must not promote tobacco or electronic cigarettes.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<br>
<a id="Q8" name="Q8"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What is a Usenet Site and why don&rsquo;t we allow them?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>Usenet sites display user-generated newsgroup messages or articles that are distributed via news servers. The content distributed via this network is often unrestricted and controversial in nature, especially in binary newsgroups that are capable of distributing large amounts of data (e.g,alt.binaries.warez, alt.binaries.erotica.teen. Common characteristics of Usenet/newsgroup access providers include:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Offer subscription plans to access usenet/newsgroup content </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Detail download parameters (e.g. unlimited, anonymous, secure) </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Promote access speed, message completion rates and retention time</span></span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><span><span>Microsoft Advertising does not accept advertising from such sites due to historical concerns with the types of content distributed using Usenet.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<span><strong><span><span><a id="Q9" name="Q9"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What are not considered firearms?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>In the <strong><span>United States</span></strong> and <strong><span>Canada</span></strong> markets, the following are allowed: cap guns, stun guns, water pistols, airsoft guns, nail guns, paintball guns, holsters, grips, sights/scopes, tripods, finishers. Additionally, the following are allowed:</span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span><span>BB Guns: Low power-BB guns, which are equivalent to Airsoft and are therefore acceptable. However, high-power air rifles (BB guns) are equivalent to gun powder rifles and are <strong><span>not</span></strong> allowed. </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Paintball guns, &quot;Airsoft&quot; guns, replicas, and imitation or &quot;look-alike&rdquo; firearms </span></span></span></span></li>
	<li><span><span><span><span>Imitation firearms. However, they must have clear markings permanently affixed to them (commonly an orange plug inserted in the barrel), and must not be readily convertible to shoot a projectile. </span></span></span></span>
	<ul>
		<li><span><span><span><span>This includes replicas/imitation guns of any age, as well as toy and cap guns.</span></span></span></span></li>
	</ul>

<a id="Q10" name="Q10"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>How do we define switchblades in the Knives as Weapons policy?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>A switchblade knife is defined as &quot;any knife having a blade which opens automatically (1) by hand pressure applied to a button or other device in the handle of the knife, or (2) by operation of inertia, gravity, or both.&quot;</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<span><strong><span><span><a id="Q11" name="Q11"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What are some examples of prohibited drugs or paraphernalia?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>We prohibit advertising the sale of all recreational drugs. Examples include marijuana and cocaine as well as less commonly known substances that go by names such as bath salts, JWH, salvia, K2, kratom, and herbal incense. Additionally we do not permit advertising for products primarily used as drug paraphernalia such as bongs, and grinders. Hookahs, water pipes, glass pipes, and glass bubblers can be used for smoking tobacco or marijuana, so we only reject this type of product if the site clearly mentions them associated with marijuana or sells other drug paraphernalia. &ldquo;Vaporizer&rdquo; can be used to refer to multiple products. Some are similar to humidifiers and perfectly fine, while others have the primary purpose of recreational drug use. Disallowed vaporizers may be called &ldquo;vapes&rdquo; or &ldquo;herbal vaporizers&rdquo;.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>

<a id="Q12" name="Q12"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Where is the policy about spy cams?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>As of 2011 we no longer restrict the sale of spy cams or other spying or surveillance equipment through our Microsoft Advertising policy. The Adult Policy still restricts certain spy cam style videos, for more information please reference the Adult Policy.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<br>
<a id="Q13" name="Q13"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Do we restrict content related to medical marijuana?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong> <span><span>We allow informational sites related to medical marijuana, but they may not link any sites that facilitate the sale or cultivation of marijuana.</span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>
<br>
<a id="Q14" name="Q14"></a><br>
Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>What are the required registrations for Finance, Gambling and Pharmacy and healthcare products and services?</span></span></strong></span></p>

Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Do we approve ads to solicit funds by advertisers on crowd-funding platforms, such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong> <span><span><span>Yes, they are approved as long as they are backed by the platforms.</span></span></span><br>
<br>
<a id="Q16" name="Q16"></a><br>
<span><strong><span><span>Q: </span></span></strong><strong><span><span>Why are certain contents, such as political, religious or sexual orientation related, monitored in some markets?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span><span><span>A:</span></span></span></strong> <span><span><span>This may be due to local sensitivity in certain geographical areas. If communication is needed, please use a modification of the following language: </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span>&ldquo;<em>Sorry, it looks like your content is restricted for the geographical area you are targeting [based on local sensitivity]. You may revise your content, or submit an appeal and we will happily review the content.</em>&rdquo;</span></span></span> </span></p>

Q: What are search on search ads?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> They are search ads on Bing that lead to another search engine&rsquo;s search results, which are of little value to the user. </span></span></span><span><strong><span><span><br>

Q: How do we evaluate search on search ads?</span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span><span>A:</span></span></strong><span><span> Ads of search on search sites that mention anything that we disallow in policy would be considered a violation, disregarding what is dynamically displayed on the landing pages. For example, an ad for &ldquo;rifles&rdquo; for a search on search site, even if the landing page does not have rifles for sale, would be considered a violation of the weapon policy. A search on search ad for &ldquo;info on marijuana&rdquo; would also be disallowed for disallowed content. A search on search ad for &ldquo;third party tech support&rdquo; would be disallowed for 3PTS.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Search on search sites may advertise their own brand or generic content that is not in the scope of our disallowed policies. Compliant ad examples, but not limited to: </span></span></span></p>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>&ldquo;Search more on searchonsearch.com&rdquo; would be an acceptable promotion of the search on search advertiser&rsquo;s own brand.</span></span></span></li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><span><span><span>&ldquo;Find cheap shoes on searchonsearch.com&rdquo; would be an acceptable ad for the generic item of &ldquo;shoes,&rdquo; a term that is not associated with our disallowed content policy.</span></span></span></li>

<strong>Q: Do we allow ads for hemp oil?</strong></span></span></span><span><span><span><br>
<br>
<strong>A:</strong> Hemp oil falls into a highly contested legal gray area. However, it appears that hemp oil, when devoid of all cannabinoids, is permitted for sale in the United States. When hemp oil contains any THC or CBD (other than trace amounts), it is considered a controlled substance and disallowed. Analysis follows:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Hemp is a variety of cannabis sativa and is the same plant species as marijuana. &quot;Industrial hemp,&quot; as it is commonly called, is a low-concentration THC variety of the cannabis plant intended to be used for purposes such as the production of cosmetics, paper, rope, and other goods. &quot;Marihuana&quot; and &quot;tetrahydrocannabinols&quot; are both Schedule I controlled substances in the United States. See Controlled Substances Act (&quot;CSA&quot;) <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deadiversion.usdoj.gov%2Fschedules%2Forangebook%2Fe_cs_sched.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7Calwa%40microsoft.com%7C11cd3dafaedb4e7b08e608d48b8d5cc3%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C1%7C636286886648524368&amp;sdata=%2B9xpzdtE53IPh9sEHxjBCxw%2Ff7G%2F4UUlFZ3%2FbjdeyX0%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">Schedule I</a>. The CSA defines &quot;marihuana&quot; to include only certain portions of the plant. See <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.deadiversion.usdoj.gov%2F21cfr%2F21usc%2F802.htm&amp;data=02%7C01%7Calwa%40microsoft.com%7C11cd3dafaedb4e7b08e608d48b8d5cc3%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C0%7C636286886648524368&amp;sdata=YLtmMtLYaa%2BT5e0MeGCfHvU6KNUZS3Qr2kbJ0bkCFFU%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">21 USC &sect; 802(16)</a> (&quot;The term &#39;marihuana&#39; [...] does not include the mature stalks of [the] plant, fiber produced from [the] stalks, oil or cake made from the seeds of [the] plant, any other compound, manufacture, salt, derivative, mixture, or preparation of such mature stalks [...], fiber, oil, or cake, or the sterilized seed of such plant.&quot;). </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The regulation of hemp in the US has been heavily litigated; circuit courts and regulators disagree on its status. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and hemp lobbyists argue that products made from industrial hemp fit entirely within the marijuana plant carve-out found in the CSA.

The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals argues that hemp is not exempt from control &ndash; because Cannabis sativa contains THC, and THC is separately scheduled. According to the Eighth Circuit: &quot;The plain language of the CSA states that schedule I(c) includes &lsquo;any material. . . which contains any quantity of THC&rsquo; and thus such material is regulated.&rdquo; <a data-content-id="" data-content-type="" href="https://na01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.ca8.uscourts.gov%2Fopndir%2F06%2F05%2F051654P.pdf&amp;data=02%7C01%7Calwa%40microsoft.com%7C11cd3dafaedb4e7b08e608d48b8d5cc3%7C72f988bf86f141af91ab2d7cd011db47%7C1%7C1%7C636286886648524368&amp;sdata=ZlyqeeY4i5x0zaAJlmzX%2FM1pzlRqs%2BjtngdiqwVtn04%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank">United States v.

<p><span><span><span>The DEA makes a similar argument: Any part of the marijuana plant that contains cannabinoids is controlled.

Recently, the DEA clarified this position:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>As the scientific literature indicates, cannabinoids, such as tetrahydrocannabinols (THC), cannabinols (CBN) and cannabidiols (CBD), are found in the parts of the cannabis plant that fall within the CSA definition of marijuana, such as the flowering tops, resin, and leaves. According to the scientific literature, cannabinoids are not found in the parts of the cannabis plant that are excluded from the CSA definition of marijuana, except for trace amounts (typically, only parts per million) that may be found where small quantities of resin adhere to the surface of seeds and mature stalk. Thus, based on the scientific literature, it is not practical to produce extracts that contain more than trace amounts of cannabinoids using only the parts of the cannabis plant that are excluded from the CSA definition of marijuana, such as oil from the seeds.</span></span></span></p>
