<h3>1. Overview</h3>

<h3 class="sbody-h4"><a id="1.1" name="1.1"></a><span>1.1 Why is this happening?</span></h3>

<p>If a customer&#39;s password is ever forgotten or stolen, they must use their security info to get back into their account. This security info is very important, therefore, so we occasionally ask customers to verify their security info to make sure they still have access to it, and that its current.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span><span><span>You can find out more information about this in <a bookmark-id="3" href="#3" managed-link=""><span>section 3</span></a></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>

</div>

<h4><a id="1.2" name="1.2"></a>1.2 How do you verify security info?</h4>
<span><span><span><span>Customers can verify security info by having a code sent to their email or phone. Once customers receive the code, they can copy and paste it into the security info verification window. This confirms that their security info is current and that they have access to it. (For more info, see <span><a bookmark-id="3.3" href="#3.3" managed-link="">section 3.3</a> - Additional resources</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>.)</span></span></span></span>

			<td class="sbody-td">Why are you making me do this?</td>
			<td class="sbody-td">Security info is the key to getting back into an account if you ever forget your password or if someone tries to break into your account. Without that info, you could permanently lose access to your account, your games, apps, subscriptions, email, photos, and files so we occasionally ask customers to confirm their info is accurate so that doesn&#39;t happen.&nbsp;</td>

		<tr class="sbody-tr">
			<td class="sbody-td">What if I don&#39;t feel comfortable sharing my other email and phone info with Microsoft?&nbsp;</td>
			<td class="sbody-td">Microsoft will never use security info for any reason other than to send security codes and send you notifications when there are problems with your account. Also, we will never share your security info with anyone else for any reason.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="sbody-tr">
			<td class="sbody-td">Why should I do this if I&#39;ve never had any problems with my account before?</td>
			<td class="sbody-td">While it&#39;s great to hear that you&#39;ve never had any problems with your account, it&#39;s still important to have insurance against accidents and that&#39;s what security info is.<br>
			<br>
			Also, while you might be good at remembering your passwords, you never know when someone might try to compromise your account.&nbsp;Having up-to-date security info helps protect against that too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
		</tr>
		<tr class="sbody-tr">
			<td class="sbody-td">Can I opt out of this or turn this off?</td>
			<td class="sbody-td">No, but if doing this is inconvenient right now, you can select&nbsp;<span class="text-base">Skip for now</span>, however that will only bypass the process for 7 days. After that, you will have to verify your info, and you cannot skip again.&nbsp;<br>
			<br>
			Verifying security info is mandatory because it is a such a vital part of keeping your account available to you in case you forget a password, or your account gets taken over. Without it, regaining access can be very difficult.<br>
			<br>
			Think about all subscriptions, apps, games, music, videos, emails, and the files you have on OneDrive. We ask you to verify your info to help you protect your access to all that important stuff because we think it&#39;s important too.<br>

			<td class="sbody-td">Why do I have to wait 30 days after deleting my security info?</td>
			<td class="sbody-td">If an attacker did replace your security info, they could permanently lock you out of your own account. The 30-day waiting period helps prevent attackers from changing your security info by giving you time to spot that change and to stop it.

<p><strong>Note</strong>: To avoid closing this window, just open another <strong>browser tab</strong> or <strong>window</strong> before they check for their code. &nbsp;</p>

<p>2. If the customer sent the code to an email address:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp;a. Check the masked phone number listed and make sure the number is correct and not transposed. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;b.&nbsp;Make sure that the customer opens the text message itself and enters the security code that is inside the text message, not the number that the message was sent from.</p>

<h4><strong><span class="text-base"><span class="text-base"><a id="2.3" name="2.3"></a></span></span></strong>2.3 Limit reached, try again later</h4>

<p>To prevent malicious activity, there is a limit to how many codes a customer can request within a period of time. If that limit is reached, customers&nbsp;are asked to try again later. If this happens, the customer&nbsp;must wait before they can try to send another code.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<strong>Note</strong>: The time out period for this is variable and dependent on several factors so it&#39;s difficult to give an exact estimate on how long a customer should wait. If asked, suggest waiting 30 minutes, if the message still appears, try again in 4 hours, if it still appears after that, try again in 24 hours.<br>

		<li>Check&nbsp;to see if their security information is confirmed within&nbsp;the MSAS tool in ASD. Confirmed info means they have done this before and if they still have the account, it should work again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>

<h4><a id="3.1" name="3.1"></a>3.1 What is Security Info?</h4>

<p>Security info is another name for the alternate email address and phone number that a customer associates with their account&nbsp;to receive security notices and security codes. Microsoft does not share security info with anyone and will never use security info for marketing purposes.<br>
<br>
<a bookmark-id="top" href="#top" managed-link="" target="">Return to top</a></p>

<h4><a id="3.2" name="3.2"></a>3.2 What is a Security Code?</h4>

<p>Security codes are numeric codes sent to an alternate email address or phone number that a customer has associated with their Microsoft account as a piece of &quot;Security info&quot;. These security codes are sent as a method of verifying the identity of an account holder by &quot;round-tripping&quot;, which is sending a code to a place only the account holder should have access to and then having a customer enter that code at a prompt to prove that they received it. In addition to using a customer&#39;s security info to round-trip a code, the customer can also use an Authenticator app which generates codes that a customer can use as security codes for identity verification.<br>
