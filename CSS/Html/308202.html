Windows 2000 Indexing Service creates an index of document content and properties (such as file name, date created, date modified, author name, and number of characters) on your local hard disks and on shared network drives. The index information is stored in catalogs. <br></div><div class='kb-moreinformation-section section'>After you create an index of documents and start Indexing Service  (it is not started by default), you can use any of the following methods to perform queries to search the index for specific text in documents or document properties: <br><br><ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Start Microsoft Windows Explorer, and then click <span class='text-base'>Search</span>.</li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Search</span> on the <span class='text-base'>Start</span> menu.</li><li>Use the Indexing Service query form.  To do this, start the Indexing Service snap-in, click to  expand the catalog that you want to search, and then click <strong class='uiterm'>Query the Catalog</strong>.  The query form is displayed in the right  pane.</li><li>Use a Web browser to submit a query in a Web page that was created by a Web master or administrator.</li></ul>When Indexing Service is installed with Windows 2000, the following catalogs are automatically created:<br><br><ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>System catalog: By default, the System catalog lists all folders on all permanently attached disk drives. It contains an index for all file system documents (except certain system and temporary files).  The System catalog is created in the volume of your hard disk that has the greatest available free space.  <br></li><li>Web catalog: If Internet Information Services (IIS) is installed, Indexing Service creates a Web catalog  that contains an index of IIS content.  By default, the Web catalog is created in the Inetpub folder.</li></ul>You can add and remove additional catalogs or configure existing catalogs to meet your requirements at any time. <br><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Create a new catalog</h3>To create a new catalog:<br><br><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Settings</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Control Panel</span>. </li><li>Double-click <span class='text-base'>Administrative Tools</span>, and then double-click <span class='text-base'>Computer Management</span>.</li><li>In the console tree, double-click <strong class='uiterm'>Services and Applications</strong>, and then double-click <span class='text-base'>Indexing Service</span>.  <br><br></li><li>Right-click <span class='text-base'>Indexing Service</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>New</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Catalog</span>.</li><li>In the <span class='text-base'>Name</span> box, type a name for your new catalog.</li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Browse</span>, click the folder in which  you want your new catalog located, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span> twice.</li><li>When you receive the &quot;Catalog will remain off-line until Indexing Service is restarted&quot; message, click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.</li></ol>The new catalog is created and is listed under <span class='text-base'>Indexing Service</span> in the console tree.<br><h3 class='sbody-h3'>Define the scope of the catalog</h3>After you create a new catalog, you must add the folders that you want included in the catalog&#39;s scope. The scope is the set of folders that is  included in and excluded from the catalog; the scope defines the content that is included and excluded from the index.  For each folder that is included or excluded, all of its subfolders are also included or excluded. <br><br><br>To define the scope of the catalog:<br><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>In the console tree, double-click the catalog to expand the container (if it is not already expanded).</li><li>Right-click <span class='text-base'>Directories</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>New</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Directory</span>.<br><br></li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Browse</span>, locate and click the folder that you want to add, and then click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.<br><br><br>If the folder that you add is located on a different computer, follow these steps:<ol class='sbody-alpha_list'><li>In the <span class='text-base'>User Name</span> box under <span class='text-base'>Account Information</span>, type the domain and user name of a user account that has permission to access that computer, for example, <span class='sbody-userinput'><strong class='sbody-strong'>domain</strong>\<strong class='sbody-strong'>username</strong></span>.</li><li>In the <span class='text-base'>Password</span> box, type the password that is associated with the user account.</li><li>In the <span class='text-base'>Alias (UNC)</span> box, type the Uniform Naming Convention (UNC) path to the folder, for example, <span class='sbody-userinput'>\\<strong class='sbody-strong'>computername</strong><strong class='sbody-strong'>\sharename</strong></span>.</li></ol></li><li>Under <strong class='uiterm'>Include in Index</strong>, perform one of the following tasks:<ul class='sbody-free_list'><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Yes</span> if you want to include the folder in the catalog.</li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>No</span> if you want to exclude the folder from the catalog.</li></ul></li><li>Click <span class='text-base'>OK</span>.</li><li>Repeat steps 2 through 5 to add additional folders to your catalog.</li><li>If Indexing Service is running, right-click <span class='text-base'>Indexing Service</span> in the console tree, and then click <span class='text-base'>Stop</span>.</li><li>Right-click <span class='text-base'>Indexing Service</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>.</li></ol>The folders that you specified are now added and are either included or excluded from the catalog.

class='sbody-h4'>No results are displayed in search results</h4>If the search does not return the expected search results when you query the index, index data may be corrupted.  <br><br><br>To troubleshoot this issue, stop and restart Indexing Service to reindex all documents:<br><br><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Settings</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Control Panel</span>.</li><li>Double-click <span class='text-base'>Administrative Tools</span>, and then double-click <span class='text-base'>Computer Management</span>.</li><li>In the console tree, double-click <strong class='uiterm'>Services and Applications</strong>. </li><li>Right-click <span class='text-base'>Indexing Service</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Stop</span>.</li><li>Right-click <span class='text-base'>Indexing Service</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>.</li></ol><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Disk is full</h4>Indexing pauses temporarily if the volume in which the catalog is stored is low on disk space.  If there is very little disk space available (less than 20 MB),  Indexing Service pauses until more disk space is freed up.  A message is logged in the Event Viewer Application log when disk space on the volume that contains the catalog starts to fill up.  <br><br><br>To troubleshoot this issue, monitor the Application Log in Event Viewer for these messages, and then free up disk space when necessary.<br><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Specific documents are not indexed</h4>If Indexing Service detects corrupted files or if it continually has problems accessing particular documents, those documents are marked as unindexed.  <br><br><br>To troubleshoot this issue, use the Indexing Service query form to generate a list of unindexed documents:<br><br><ol class='sbody-num_list'><li>Click <span class='text-base'>Start</span>, point to <span class='text-base'>Settings</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Control Panel</span>. </li><li>Double-click <span class='text-base'>Administrative Tools</span>, and then double-click <span class='text-base'>Computer Management</span>.</li><li>In the console tree, double-click <strong class='uiterm'>Services and Applications</strong>, and then double-click <span class='text-base'>Indexing Service</span>.  <br></li><li>Click <strong class='uiterm'>Query the Catalog</strong>.<br><br></li><li>In the <strong class='uiterm'>Enter your free text query below</strong> box, type <span class='sbody-userinput'>@unfiltered=true</span>, and then click <span class='text-base'>Search</span>.<br><br><br>A list of unindexed documents is displayed below the query form in the details pane.  If a specific type of document is  not indexed consistently, investigate possible issues with the filter that is used to index those documents.</li></ol><h4 class='sbody-h4'>Network connection is lost</h4>If folders in a catalog are located on remote computers, and the connection to those network shares is lost, Indexing Service detects and scans the network shares to determine when the connection is active again.  You do not need to reconfigure the catalog.<br></div><div class='kb-references-section section'><span>For more information about how to configure Indexing Service to use the neutral word breaker, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br><br><div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-1' href='/en-us/help/271818'>271818 </a> How to configure Windows 2000 Indexing Service to use the Neutral word breaker<br><br></div></span><span>For more information about how to set up Windows 2000 Indexing Service as a generic clustered service, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:<br><br><div class='indent'><a id='kb-link-2' href='/en-us/help/292542'>292542 </a> How to set up Windows 2000 Indexing Service as a generic clustered service<br><br></div></span></div><div class='kb-securedata-section section'>Author: V-MOVENS (2001-09-19T13:22:00)<br><br>Tech Reviewer: RODNEYF (2001-11-20T09:30:00)<br>Edit Reviewer: V-JANHAL (2001-11-21T09:50:00)<br><br></div>
