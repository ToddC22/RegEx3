		<h2>It's finally here!</h2>
		<p>
		Today we've announced a great new solution for all those 
		looking to make unified communications a reality. We are all struggling with 
		the proliferation of more or less improvised communications infrastructures: 
		with bring your own device, many teams have vastly different toolsets for mail,
		voice, IM chat, etc. 
		IT has often given up trying to regulate this mess, but is rather looking for 
		solutions which can make all these tools work together.

		<h2>RightThere: the right solution</h2>
		<p>
		Now SmartTech RightThere is here to provide exactly that! With 
		our RealLife Platform, we can provide connectivity can provide connectivity 
		between any older N7 RightThere System rooms can collaborate with new Lync 
		clients in Virtual Meeting Rooms. You can install an the HDX Eye Detector and 
		other cool immersive technologies right in your N7 environments. You can even use
		your traditional NUCM and N7 video assets.
		</p>
		<p>
		Not only does this work out-of-the-box, but its also smart. Reducing bandwidth 
		and eliminating the need for expensive gateways to tie everything together. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Even better, it's all based on the RightThere Interoperability Protocol which 
		is open and available to any vendor signed up to IMTC. As Eileen Li, our CMO, 
		said at our recent briefing on the release: "Enterprises need to ensure they use 
		open and interoperable protocols to ensure that they get the functionality they 
		need while protecting existing investments. A multivendor approach can reduce 
		costs and simplify network complexity"
