# Task 541858

See the .artifactignore file.

SQL Server 2019 Big Data Clusters requires block storage for all persisted volumes. Management operation on top of the persisted volumes created and used by a big data cluster is a capability that depends on the storage provider including, for example, operations to expand persistent volumes (PVs).
# Task 542306

[!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] offers important brokered services, such as the following.

A [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] extension should consume a brokered service using the latest available VS release property from the <xref:Microsoft.VisualStudio.VisualStudioServices> class, considering the minimum required version of [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] that the extension targets.
Taking the previous solution service example, this would mean that an extension that targets [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../code-quality/includes/vsprvs_md.md)] 2019 Update 9 or later should acquire the VisualStudioServices.VS2019_5Services.SolutionService descriptor from the VisualStudioServices.VS2019_9 property.
